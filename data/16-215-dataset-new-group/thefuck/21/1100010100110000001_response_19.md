The bug in the function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command. This is because the function is assuming that there will always be a second element after splitting the command, which is not the case when the command is just "git".

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the script in the command is not empty, and then access its second element after splitting. We also need to handle cases where the 'usage:' message is not present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has more than one element before checking if the second element is 'stash'. And then it checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

This should resolve the `IndexError` and the corrected function will pass the failing test.
