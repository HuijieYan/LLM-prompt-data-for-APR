## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash'. This might cause an IndexError if there are not enough words in the script.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails the test because it assumes that the second word in the command script is always 'stash', leading to a potential IndexError. This causes the function to not match the command correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script contains at least two words before accessing the second word. If it does, then we can check if the second word is 'stash'. If not, the function should return False.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
