The buggy function is the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash` rule. It is supposed to match if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, the bug occurs when the script is just 'git', causing an IndexError.

The buggy function fails the test `test_not_match`. The command is "git" and the stderr is a git error message, but the function encounters an IndexError.

The GitHub issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" provides the error trace, which shows that the bug is caused by an IndexError when the script is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check the length of `command.script.split()` before checking the second index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version checks if `command.script.split()` has more than one part before checking the second index to avoid the IndexError. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue.
