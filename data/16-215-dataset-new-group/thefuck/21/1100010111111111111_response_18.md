The bug here is that the `command.script` is split and directly attempted to access the second element of the resulting list without any boundary check, leading to an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the script is not long enough.

The buggy function should be updated to include a check for the length of the split command before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
