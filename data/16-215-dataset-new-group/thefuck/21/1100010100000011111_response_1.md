## Analysis
The `match` function appears to be checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. However, based on the GitHub issue, it seems that there is an IndexError when trying to split `command.script` into multiple parts.

## Potential error locations
The potential error is in the line `command.script.split()[1]`, where if `command.script` does not contain more than 1 word, it will cause an IndexError.

## Bug cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` contains at least 2 words to be split. The GitHub issue shows that the script only contains 'git', which causes the split to have only 1 part, leading to the IndexError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to first check if the command.script actually contains more than 1 word before attempting to access the second word using index 1. If not, we should return False.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()  # Split the script into parts
    if len(script_parts) < 2:  # Ensure there are at least 2 parts
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'  # Check if the second part is 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)  # Check if 'usage:' is in command.stderr
```
