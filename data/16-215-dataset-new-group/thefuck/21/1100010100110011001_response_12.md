### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match a git command that has an error message related to the 'git stash' command. However, the function is throwing an `IndexError` which occurs when the script does not have a second element after splitting it.

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error is in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where it is assumed that the second element will always exist after splitting the script.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by assuming that the second element will always exist after splitting the script. If the script does not contain any space-separated elements, it will throw an `IndexError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

In the corrected version, I have split the script and then checked if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This prevents the IndexError from occurring.
