The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is causing an IndexError because it tries to split the command script and access the second element without first checking if the script exists. The bug occurs when the script is just 'git' and not 'git stash', which leads to the list index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we need to check whether the script has enough elements before accessing the second element. We can also add a check to see if 'stash' is the second element after splitting the script.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function checks whether the script has more than one element, and then it checks if the second element is 'stash' before proceeding with the rest of the conditions. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and address the issue reported on GitHub.
