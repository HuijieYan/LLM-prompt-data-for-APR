The issue with the `match` function is that it is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. When the script is empty, it will raise an `IndexError` because there are no elements to access.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script split has more than one element before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version checks if the `command.script.split()` has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This should fix the `IndexError` that was raised in the failing test.
