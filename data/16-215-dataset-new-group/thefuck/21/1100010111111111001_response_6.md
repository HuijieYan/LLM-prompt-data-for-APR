The bug is caused by the buggy function assuming that the command script will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace. This assumption leads to an IndexError when accessing the second element of the split command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if 'stash' is present in the command script and 'usage:' is present in the command stderr, which addresses the issue of the buggy function's assumption about the command script structure. This modification will ensure that the function works properly for the provided test case and other similar cases.
