To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to account for the scenario where the `command.script` does not contain any whitespace-separated elements. We will do this by first checking that the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `command.script.split()` before accessing its elements, we can avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring when the script contains only one element.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue that was posted on GitHub about the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just "git".
