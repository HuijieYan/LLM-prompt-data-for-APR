The buggy function `match` is supposed to return True if the command matches 'git stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:', otherwise, it should return False.

The error message shows an IndexError: list index out of range, which indicates that the script.split() method is trying to access an index that does not exist.

The buggy function `match` is failing to handle the case where the command is just 'git' without any arguments, which causes the split() method to return an empty list and leads to the IndexError in the subsequent comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the split list has at least two elements before performing comparisons.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_args = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_args) > 1 and script_args[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the script has at least two elements and then proceed with the comparison. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the function works as expected.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
