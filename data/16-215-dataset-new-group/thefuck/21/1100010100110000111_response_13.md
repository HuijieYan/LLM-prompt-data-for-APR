The buggy function `match` in `git_fix_stash.py` is throwing an `IndexError` on line 8, caused by trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list.

The error message states that the `command.script` is simply "git" and `command.stderr` is a list of git commands. This means that the script doesn't contain the "stash" command, which causes the split function to return a list with only one element, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we can modify the matching condition to verify that "stash" is present in the list of available git commands in `command.stderr` instead of relying on `command.script` alone.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.stderr
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
