The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash', and if the 'usage:' string is in the `command.stderr`. The error occurs because the `command.script` is split into a list, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second word if the script does not have multiple words. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` starts with 'git stash' rather than extracting the second word. We also need to check if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr` rather than the exact match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
