The bug in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the `git` command is run without any arguments specified. This is because the `match` function is splitting the command script and trying to access the second element without checking if it exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to first check if the command script contains at least one element before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification ensures that the `match` function first checks if the `command.script` has at least one element before trying to access the second element. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the `git` command is run without any arguments.
