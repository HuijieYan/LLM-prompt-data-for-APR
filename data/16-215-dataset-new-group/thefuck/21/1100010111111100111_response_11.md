The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule occurs because the `match` function assumes that the `command.script` will always contain more than one element after splitting by whitespace, which is causing the `IndexError`. The issue is related to the fact that when the `command.script` is only 'git', it does not have an element at index 1, resulting in the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `match` function to handle the case where `command.script` may not contain more than one element after splitting by whitespace.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the first part of `command.script` is 'git' and also make sure that there are more than one element after splitting. If these conditions are met, we then perform the original check for 'stash' and 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
