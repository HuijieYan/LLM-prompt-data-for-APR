The buggy function is failing because it is trying to access an index in the list without checking if the list actually contains that index.

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script` in the failing test contains only one word, 'git', which causes `command.script.split()[1]` to throw an `IndexError` since there is only one item in the list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before accessing the second item.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and
            split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will resolve the issue posted on GitHub about the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
