The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. It then returns the result of this check. However, the failing test is showing that the index for the split script is out of range, which means there is no second element to access in the split script.

The cause of the bug is that the split function is being called without checking if there are enough elements to support the split operation. 

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command will return enough elements before trying to access the second element. If not, we can return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
