The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is causing an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just `'git'`. The buggy function is attempting to access the second element of the split `command.script` without checking if it exists, which causes the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check whether the `command.script` has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
