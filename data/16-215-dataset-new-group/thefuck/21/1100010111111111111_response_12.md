The bug in the function `match` is caused by an `IndexError` in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. This error occurs when `command.script` does not have at least two elements after splitting by spaces.

The buggy function should be fixed by adding a check to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version adds a check for the length of the split result before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
