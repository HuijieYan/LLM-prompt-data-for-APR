## Bug Explanation
The buggy function is attempting to split the command script by spaces and check if the second element is 'stash', which can cause an IndexError when the command script has no spaces. This is consistent with the reported GitHub issue, where the 'git' command script is passed and results in a list index out of range error.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script has at least two elements before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, we first split the command script into parts and then check if the length of the split command is greater than 1. If it is, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash', and also check if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This should resolve the bug and prevent the IndexError.
