The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the git command is related to `stash` and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The buggy function is failing with an `IndexError` due to the `command.script.split()[1]` failing when `command.script` doesn't contain any spaces.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. Secondly, we can check if the string 'stash' is present in the `command.script` before proceeding with the check for 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and 'stash' in script_parts 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
