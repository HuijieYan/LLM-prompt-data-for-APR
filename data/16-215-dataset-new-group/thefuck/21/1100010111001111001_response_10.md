The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is in the `command.stderr`. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is not `'git stash'`, which causes the function to return `False` when it should return `True`.

To fix this, we should modify the function to check if the `command.script` contains the word `'stash'` and if the `command.stderr` contains the word `'usage:'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
