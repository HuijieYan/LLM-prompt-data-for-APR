## Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to match a command that contains the word "stash" as the second word in the command script and the word "usage:" in the stderr.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `command.script.split()[1]` may cause an error if the script does not contain at least two words.
2. The comparison `== 'stash'` may not match the intended command due to case sensitivity.
3. The condition `'usage:' in command.stderr` may not accurately capture the presence of the "usage:" message.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the assumption that the command script will always have at least two words, the comparison being case-sensitive, and the inaccurate matching of the "usage:" message in the stderr.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the length of the split command script to ensure it contains at least two words.
2. Use a case-insensitive comparison for the word "stash".
3. Use a more robust method to identify the "usage:" message in the stderr.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1].lower() == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower())
```
