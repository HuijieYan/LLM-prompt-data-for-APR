The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is a git stash and if the stderr contains the string "usage:". However, the current implementation is causing an `IndexError` when the command is just 'git' without any arguments, which fails the test. 

To fix the bug, we can check if the `split()` operation on the `command.script` returns a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also check if the command is 'stash' and if the stderr contains "usage:".

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
