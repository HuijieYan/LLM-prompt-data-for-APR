The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the list returned by splitting `command.script`, but it is assuming that the split will always result in at least two elements. In this case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, so splitting it will result in a list with only one element, causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the list returned by splitting `command.script` before trying to access its second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will first split the `command.script` and then check if the length of the resulting list is more than 1 before trying to access its second element. This will prevent the IndexError and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
