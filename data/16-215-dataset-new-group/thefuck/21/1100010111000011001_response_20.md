In the provided `match` function, there is an issue with the conditional statement. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is not sufficient. It should also check if the first part of the input is 'git'. 

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statement only checks if the first part of the input is 'stash', but it does not check if the complete input matches 'git stash'.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `command.script.split()[0]` is equal to 'git' and `command.script.split()[1]` is equal to 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `match` function should now pass the failing test case.
