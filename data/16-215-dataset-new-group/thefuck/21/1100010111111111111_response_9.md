The bug occurs in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file where it checks if the command script is for stashing and if the usage message is present in the command stderr. The issue arises when the script is just 'git', and it tries to access the second element after splitting by space, causing an IndexError.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to first ensure that the length of the split command script is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
