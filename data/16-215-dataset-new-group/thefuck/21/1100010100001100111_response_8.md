The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is causing an `IndexError` because it's expecting the `command.script` to have at least 2 elements after splitting it, which is not satisfied when the script is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing the second element. If the length of the split script is less than 2, we can return `False`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix adds a check to ensure that there are at least 2 elements after splitting the `command.script` before accessing the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function will return `False`, avoiding the `IndexError`.
