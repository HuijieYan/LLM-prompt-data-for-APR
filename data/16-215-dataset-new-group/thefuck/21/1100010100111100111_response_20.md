The bug in the code occurs because the function is attempting to access the second element of the split command script without checking whether it exists. This causes an IndexError when the script is only "git", as in this case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split command script has enough elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError when the script is just "git".

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
