#### The cause of the bug:
The buggy function is causing an IndexError because it tries to access index 1 of the `command.script.split()` list when the `command.script` only contains the word "git". This triggers an index out of range error.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the condition in the `match` function to check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before accessing index 1. If the length is not greater than 1, the function should return False.

#### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
