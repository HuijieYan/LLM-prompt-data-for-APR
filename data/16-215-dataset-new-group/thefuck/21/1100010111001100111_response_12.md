The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule causes it to fail when the command is just `git`. The buggy function `match` tries to split the `command.script` and checks if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, when the script is just `git`, the split operation creates a list with only one element, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that there are at least two elements in the split result before checking for 'stash'. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (script_parts and len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `script_parts` is not empty and has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError when the script is just `git`.
