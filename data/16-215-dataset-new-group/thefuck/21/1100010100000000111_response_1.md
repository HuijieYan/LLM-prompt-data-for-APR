The cause of the bug:
The `match` function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash', but when the command is just 'git', there are no words in the `command.script`, which causes an `IndexError`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to first check if `command.script` contains any words before trying to access the second word. If `command.script` is just 'git', then we should return False.

Based on this, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
