The buggy function is intended to match a specific error message in the stderr of a git command. However, the function is currently checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

The bug is that the function is not correctly checking for the word 'stash' in the command script and is incorrectly checking for 'usage:' in the stderr.

To fix this bug, we should check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
