## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The bug in the original function is caused by using the index 1 when splitting the command.script, which leads to comparing 'git' with 'stash' causing the function to return False. The corrected version uses index 0 when splitting the command.script to correctly compare it with 'git'.
