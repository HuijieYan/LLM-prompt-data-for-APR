### Correction:

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `match` is failing because it is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists or not. This causes an `IndexError` when the command script doesn't have a second element.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to first check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

## The corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
