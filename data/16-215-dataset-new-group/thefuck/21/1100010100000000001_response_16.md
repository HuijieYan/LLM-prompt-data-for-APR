## Analysis of the buggy function

The buggy function is a part of a script that is supposed to match a Git command with an error message related to using the "git stash" command. The function is supposed to return True if the command is related to "git stash" and if the error message contains 'usage:'.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The function may not handle cases where the command script does not have a second word (index out of range error).
2. The comparison using 'and' may not work as intended.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug in the function is that it does not handle the cases when the command.script has less than two words, which will result in an index out of range error. Additionally, the comparison using 'and' may not work as intended to check if the error message contains 'usage:'.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the length of the command.script.split() to avoid an index out of range error.
2. Use the 'in' operator to check if 'stash' is in the command.script instead of direct comparison.
3. Use the 'in' operator to check if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version:
- We first split the command script into words and store it in a variable.
- Then we use the 'in' operator to check if 'stash' is in the script words.
- We also use the 'in' operator to check if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.
- This approach ensures that we avoid index out of range errors and properly check for the conditions as intended.
