The buggy function is comparing the second element of the `command.script.split()` list to the string `'stash'`. However, in Case 1, the `command.script` is `'git'`, so when split, it only contains one element, causing the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the `command.script.split()` list is at least 2 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) >= 2 and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function checks the length of the split script elements and only compares the second element if the length is at least 2, which will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
