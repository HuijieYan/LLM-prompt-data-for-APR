The buggy function is designed to match the git command if the second word is 'stash' and the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the function fails to handle cases where the input command does not match these criteria. The failing test `test_not_match` indicates that the function incorrectly raises an IndexError when the input command is `git` and the error message contains the 'usage:' line.

The cause of the bug is that the function blindly assumes that the input command will always contain at least two words, leading to an IndexError when accessing the second word using `command.script.split()[1]`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to first check if the input command contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word. This can be done by splitting the command script and checking the length of the resulting list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and
            words[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
With this correction, the function will properly handle cases where the input command does not contain the expected number of words before attempting to access the second word. This should resolve the IndexError issue and make the function pass the failing test.
