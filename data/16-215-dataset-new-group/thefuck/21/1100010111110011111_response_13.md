## Correction

The buggy function `match` is experiencing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`. This error occurs when the `command.script` does not contain any whitespace-separated elements, leading to an empty list after the split.

To fix this, we need to check if the split result has any elements before trying to access the second element. If there are no elements, then the script does not match the condition, and we should return `False`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version adds a check to ensure that the split result has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. If there are fewer than 2 elements, the function returns `False`, resolving the `IndexError` issue.
