The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` because it is trying to index the list returned by `split()` without checking if the list exists. This is due to the fact that the function is splitting the command script by spaces and then trying to access the second element of the resulting list, which may not exist if the script is only "git". The provided test function `test_not_match` is failing with the given error message because it is trying to match the command script "git" with the condition in the buggy function, which is causing the IndexError.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the resulting list from `split()` has more than one element before trying to access the second element. If the list doesn't have more than one element, the match condition should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the `script_parts` list has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError and ensure that the correct match condition is met.

This fix should resolve the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
