The cause of the bug in the buggy function is an IndexError, which occurs when trying to access an index in a list that does not exist. This indicates that the `command.script` is not splitting into multiple elements, resulting in only one element in the list, and a subsequent attempt to access the second element (index 1) raises an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` is split into multiple elements, and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first splitting `command.script` into `script_parts` and checking if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1, we avoid the IndexError. Then we proceed with the comparison of the second element with 'stash' and the presence of 'usage:' in `command.stderr`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
