The buggy function is failing to correctly match the condition and is raising an IndexError due to an attempt to access an index that doesn't exist in the split command.script. The issue on GitHub also confirms this bug.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the length of the split `command.script` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This fix will ensure that the function will not raise an IndexError when accessing the second index of the split command.script. After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
