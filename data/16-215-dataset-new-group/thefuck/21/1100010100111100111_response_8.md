The buggy function `match` is trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without verifying that it exists, resulting in an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the script provided is just `'git'`. The issue on GitHub confirms that the rule fails when the script is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
