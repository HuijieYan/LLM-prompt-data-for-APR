### The buggy function

The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command.

### Identified potential error locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is the expression `command.script.split()[1]`, where the program attempts to access the second element of the split array.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for commands with less than two words in the `script` attribute, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to access the second element of the split array.

### Bug fixing strategy
To fix the bug, the function should first check if the length of the split array is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. This can be achieved by adding a check for the length of the split array before performing the comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
