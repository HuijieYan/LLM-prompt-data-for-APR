The buggy function is intended to match a specific git command that includes 'stash' in the second position and has 'usage:' in the stderr. However, there are potential error locations in the function that could cause the bug.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The function does not handle cases where the command.script split does not contain at least 2 elements, which would result in an index error when trying to access the second element.
2. The function does not handle cases where 'stash' is not the second element in the command script split.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not have proper error handling for the command.script.split and does not check if 'stash' is in the correct position.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to include error handling for the command.script.split and check if 'stash' is in the correct position before checking for 'usage:' in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()    
    return (len(script_split) > 1
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
