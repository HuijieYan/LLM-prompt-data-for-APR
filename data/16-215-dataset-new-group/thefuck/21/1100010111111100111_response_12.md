The buggy function, `match`, is intended to check if the command is a git command to stash and if the error message contains "usage:". However, the function is failing due to an index error. This means that the function is trying to access an index of the split command script that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `split` operation is safe by first checking if the command script contains more than one element before accessing the index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and
            script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `script_parts` has a length greater than 1 before accessing index 1. This will prevent the index error and resolve the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
