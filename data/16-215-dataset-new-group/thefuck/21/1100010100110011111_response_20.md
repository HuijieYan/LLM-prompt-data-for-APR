## Cause of the bug
The buggy function is trying to split the command script by spaces and then check if the second element is 'stash'. However, when the command is just 'git', there is no second element, which results in an IndexError.

## Fix Strategy
We need to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' before attempting to split it and access the second element. If it does not, then the function should return False.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
