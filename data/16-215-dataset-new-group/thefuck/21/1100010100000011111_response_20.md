The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash', and if the stderr of the command contains the word 'usage:'. However, the function is not handling the case where the script contains only 'git' and no other command parameters, leading to an IndexError in the split() function when trying to access index 1 of the resulting list.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before checking the second word.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split() # Split the command script
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

By adding a check for the length of the split command script, we ensure that we only check the second word if there are at least two words in the command script. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and resolve the bug.
