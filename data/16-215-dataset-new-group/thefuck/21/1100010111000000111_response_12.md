The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if a Git command is using `stash` and if the output contains the string "usage:". However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the bug occurs when the script is just "git" and causes an IndexError because the split operation doesn't find a second element to check.

To fix the bug, we can update the `match` function to check if the script contains "stash" and if "usage:" is in stderr. If the script is just "git", we can return False to signify that the rule does not match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script:
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```

With this updated function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
