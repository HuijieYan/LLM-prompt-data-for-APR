## Analysis
The buggy function is `match`, which is a part of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The function is supposed to check if the command pertains to a git stash operation and if there is an error message related to the usage of the stash command. The failing test is `test_not_match` from the `test_git_fix_stash` file, and it checks if the `match` function does not match a specific command and error message.

The potential error in the function is at `command.script.split()[1]` where it attempts to access the second word of the command, assuming it exists. This can lead to an IndexError if the command does not contain any arguments.

## Bug Explanation
The failing test is due to an error being raised within the `match` function. The `IndexError` is caused when attempting to access the second word of the command, assuming that it exists. If the command does not contain any arguments, the `split()[1]` will result in an `IndexError` since there's no second element in the list.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if the command contains arguments before attempting to access the second word. If there are no arguments, then it should not proceed with the further comparison.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(command_parts) > 1:
        return (command_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
