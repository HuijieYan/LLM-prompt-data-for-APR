The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` error because it's splitting the command script and trying to access the second element without checking if it exists or not.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that there are at least two elements in the list returned by `split()`. We should also check for the presence of 'usage:' in the `stderr` of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script) > 1 
        and script[1] == 'stash' 
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
