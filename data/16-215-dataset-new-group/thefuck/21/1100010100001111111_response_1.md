The issue with the buggy function is that it is attempting to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without checking if the list has at least two elements, which causes an `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `'git'`. 

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `command.script` contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits the `command.script` into a list of elements and then checks if the list contains at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. This should resolve the `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `'git'`.
