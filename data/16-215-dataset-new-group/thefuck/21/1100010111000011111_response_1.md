The buggy function `match` is intended to check if a `git` command is used for stashing and if the command response includes an error message. However, the `match` function only works if the `git` command is followed by another parameter, such as `stash`. 

The bug occurs when the `git` command is used alone without any additional parameter. In this case, `command.script` does not contain any parameter at index 1, which results in an `IndexError` when trying to access element 1 of the split command. 

To fix this, the function should first check if the `git` command is used and then, if the actual command is `stash`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected function checks if the first parameter in the script is `git` and the second parameter is `stash`, before checking for the error message in the command's stderr. This should resolve the `IndexError` and the failing test case, as well as address the GitHub issue.
