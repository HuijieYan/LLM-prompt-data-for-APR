The bug in the function is caused by assuming that the script will always have at least two words, which is not the case when the input is just 'git', as seen in the GitHub issue. The expected input parameter values and types are as follows:
- command.script: 'git'
- command: object of type Command
- command.stderr: the git usage message

The buggy function should be modified to handle the case where the command script is just 'git' and update the condition to check for the word 'stash' in the command script.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated as follows:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The updated function checks if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before comparing the second word with 'stash'. This modification ensures that the function can handle cases where the script has fewer than two words, as seen in the failing test execution, and satisfies the expected input/output variable values while resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
