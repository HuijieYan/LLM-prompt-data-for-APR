## Analysis of the buggy function and the failing test
The buggy function `match` is supposed to match a command if it starts with 'git stash' and the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the failing test `test_not_match` expects the function to not match a command, which means the condition for matching is incorrect.

## Potential error location
The potential error in the buggy function is the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function incorrectly checks for the presence of the word 'stash' at the second position in the command, which is not accurate.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should reconsider how the function checks for the command and the condition for matching. We need to ensure that the function accurately identifies the 'git stash' command and checks the stderr for the presence of 'usage:'.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, the `startswith` method is used to accurately check if the command starts with 'git stash', and the condition for 'usage:' in stderr remains the same. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
