The buggy function does not appear to be properly checking for the 'stash' keyword in the command script and for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr of the command. 

Based on the failing test, the expected input values are:
- command.script: "git"
- command.stderr: git_stash_err

The expected output values are:
- match(command): False

To fix the bug, the function should properly check if the command script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass.
