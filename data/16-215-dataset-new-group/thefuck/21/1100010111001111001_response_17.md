The buggy function is trying to check if the command entered is a git stash command and if it produced an error message indicating incorrect usage. However, the comparison in the return statement is incorrect, as it is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' instead of the first word.

The buggy function should be fixed by splitting the command script to check the first word instead of the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
