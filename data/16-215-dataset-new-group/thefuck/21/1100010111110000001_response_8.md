The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command matches a specific condition. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` occurring at `command.script.split()[1]` which means that `split()` is not returning enough elements to access the index 1.

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script` is not splitting correctly, resulting in an empty list or a list with only one element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list contains enough elements before accessing index 1. If not, we should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
