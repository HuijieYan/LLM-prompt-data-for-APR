The buggy function `match` takes a `Command` object as an input and checks if the script starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, it fails to properly check the stderr for the 'git stash' command.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison in the return statement of the function. The function is not properly checking if the stderr contains 'usage:' for the 'git stash' command.

To fix this bug, we should modify the return statement to properly check if 'usage:' is in the stderr for the 'git stash' command. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will properly check if the 'git stash' command is used and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. This should make the failing test pass.
