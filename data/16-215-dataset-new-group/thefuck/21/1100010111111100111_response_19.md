The bug is in the buggy function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py`. The function's logic is to check if the first word of the `command.script` is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The bug is likely caused by `command.script` not having any whitespace-separated words, leading to the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` splits into multiple words before trying to access the second word. We also need to check if the `command.stderr` is not empty before checking if 'usage:' is in it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' 
            and command.stderr is not None and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the `command.script` can be split into multiple words and then checks the second word for 'stash'. It also verifies that `command.stderr` is not `None` before checking for 'usage:'. This should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function more robust.
