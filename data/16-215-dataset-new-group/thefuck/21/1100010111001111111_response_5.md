The bug in the function is that it's directly accessing the list returned by splitting the command script without checking if it has more than one element. This is causing an IndexError when the script is just "git". To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command returns more than one element before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split command has more than one element before comparing the second element to 'stash', which resolves the IndexError issue and passes the failing test.
