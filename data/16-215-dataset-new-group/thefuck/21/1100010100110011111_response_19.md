Based on the error message, the buggy function is throwing an IndexError on the line `command.script.split()[1]` when the initial script includes only "git" without any additional arguments. The function is expecting the second element of the split command, but since there is only one element in this case, it results in an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function checks if the split script has more than one element before accessing the second element. This fix should resolve the IndexError and make the function handle the "git" command without additional arguments correctly.
