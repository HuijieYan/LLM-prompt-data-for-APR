The buggy function `match` is supposed to determine whether a Git command error message indicates a problem with using `git stash`. The function checks if the second word of the command script is "stash" and if the usage message is in the stderr of the command. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, which is causing an IndexError in the code.

The cause of the bug is that if the command does not contain a script that includes "stash", it will throw an error due to the `split()[1]` call, as there will be only one element in the split list, as also verified from the failing test. This means that the function is expecting the second word to be "stash" even if the command is just "git", causing an index out of range error.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the length of the split command script is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and
            script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification to the function, the issue should be resolved, and the provided test case should pass.
