The buggy function is failing to handle cases where the command script does not contain the word 'stash' as the second word. This is causing an IndexError because the function attempts to access the second element of the command.script.split() list when it may not exist.

To fix this, we need to first check if the script contains the word 'stash' before attempting to access the second word. Then we can check if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
