The bug in the `git_fix_stash` function is caused by trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`. When the value of `command.script` is just `'git'`, there is no second element, resulting in a `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the function will first check if the split_script list has more than 1 element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError when the script is just `'git'`.

After applying this fix, the `match` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
