The buggy function is designed to match the command script and the error message from the stderr to identify if the command is related to git stash. The function is intended to return True if the script contains the word 'stash' and the error message contains 'usage:', otherwise it should return False.

The bug in the function is that it is currently checking only the second word in the command script instead of the first word. Additionally, it is not checking if the word 'stash' is present in the command script.

To fix the bug, the function should split the command script and check if the first word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in split_script[0]
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly match the git stash command and the associated error message, and return True as intended.
