The buggy function `match` is failing with an `IndexError` when the input command script is `"git"` and the stderr contains a usage message related to stash.

The function is failing at the line `command.script.split()[1]` because it is trying to access index 1 of the split command, but when the script is just "git", the split result only contains one element, and hence accessing index 1 leads to an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can check if the split result has more than one element before trying to access index 1. If it has more than one element and the second element is "stash", then we return True.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
