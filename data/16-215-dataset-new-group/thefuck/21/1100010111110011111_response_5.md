The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is caused by the `match` function trying to access an index of a list that does not exist. This is evident from the IndexError: list index out of range error message in the failing test.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the buggy line `command.script.split()[1]` tries to split the `command.script` and access the second element without checking if it exists.

To fix this bug, the function needs to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function first splits the `command.script` into parts and then checks if there are at least two parts before accessing the second element. This change should resolve the IndexError issue and make the function pass the failing test case.

Please note that the `Command` class and `git_stash_err` variable are not defined in the provided code, so the corrected function assumes their existence with appropriate values in the failing test context.
