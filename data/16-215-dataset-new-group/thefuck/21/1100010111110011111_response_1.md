The bug in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is causing an IndexError because the `command.script.split()` method is attempting to access the second element of the split list without checking if it exists. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will no longer raise an IndexError when accessing the second element of the split command, and will pass the failing test case.
