### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation:
The buggy function `match` was failing because only `command.script.split()[1]` was used to check if the command is 'stash'. However, the failing test was not providing the complete script for the `command`, only 'git' was provided. This was causing an `IndexError` as there was no second element in the split list. The corrected version checks if the first element in the split list is 'git' and then checks for 'stash' in the same list.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
