Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be caused by the fact that the function `match` does not account for the scenario where the `command.script` contains only "git" and no further arguments, which results in an IndexError when trying to access the second element with `split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the script contains more than one element before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the parts in `script_parts`. Then, we check if `script_parts` has more than one element before accessing the second element and comparing it with 'stash'. This ensures that we prevent the IndexError when trying to access non-existent elements.
