### Output
The buggy function does not handle the case where the `command.script` does not contain 'stash' as the second word and 'usage:' is not in the `command.stderr`.

### Bug
The bug is in the `match` function. It only checks if the second word of `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. It does not consider the case when the second word is not 'stash'.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if 'stash' is in `command.script` in the match function.

### The corrected function
```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (for_app('git')(command)
            and 'stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
