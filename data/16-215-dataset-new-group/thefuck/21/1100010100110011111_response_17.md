## Update the Bug Fix

### Identify potential error locations
The potential error locations can be the command.script value or the condition `command.script.split()[1]`, as the error suggests that the list index is out of range.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The buggy function tries to access the second element of the list created by splitting the `command.script`. The error occurs because `command.script` does not have a second element when the `command.script` is just 'git', which causes the list index to be out of range.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also add a check for this specific condition to prevent the IndexError.

### Updated version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The updated version of the function checks if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This prevents the IndexError from occurring when `command.script` does not have a second element.
