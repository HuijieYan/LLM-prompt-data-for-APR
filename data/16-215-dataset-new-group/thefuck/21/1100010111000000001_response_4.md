The buggy function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py` has a potential error location in the return statement. The current implementation checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. However, this might not accurately determine if the command is for stashing in git.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation does not accurately match the command script and stderr to determine if it's a git stash command.

To fix the bug, a better strategy would be to use regular expressions to accurately match the command script and stderr to determine if it's a git stash command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    pattern = r'^git stash'
    if re.match(pattern, command.script) and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this fix, the function will accurately check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr to determine if it's a git stash command. This should pass the failing test.
