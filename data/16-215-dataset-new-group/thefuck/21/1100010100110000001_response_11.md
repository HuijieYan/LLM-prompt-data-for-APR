The buggy function is `match` and it is intended to check if the command matches a git stash error message. The `IndexError` error message indicates that there is an issue with trying to access an index of a list that is out of range. 

In the buggy function, the error is likely occurring in the line `command.script.split()[1]`, this could be because `command.script` is not always split into multiple words.

To fix this bug, we can first verify that the command has at least 2 words before trying to access the second word. We can also check if the first word is "git" and the second word is "stash". Then, we can check if the "usage:" string is present in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[0] == 'git' and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

This corrected version first splits the command script into words and checks if the length is greater than 1. Then, it verifies that the first word is "git" and the second word is "stash". If these conditions are met, it checks for the presence of "usage:" in the `command.stderr` and returns the appropriate boolean value. This should fix the bug and the function should now pass the failing test.
