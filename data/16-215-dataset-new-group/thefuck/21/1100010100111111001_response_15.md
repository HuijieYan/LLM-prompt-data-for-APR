The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to split the command.script without checking if it exists, which can lead to an IndexError. The function is expected to return True only when the second part of the split command.script is 'stash' and the 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where the command.script doesn't have a second part before trying to access it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This fix ensures that the split command.script has at least two parts before trying to access the second part to avoid the IndexError. If the split doesn't result in at least two parts, it returns False.
