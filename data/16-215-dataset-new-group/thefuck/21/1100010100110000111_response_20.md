The buggy function is causing an IndexError in the match function due to `command.script.split()[1]` when the script is 'git'. This is happening because `command.script.split()` is returning an empty list, and therefore trying to access index 1 is causing the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before trying to access index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function that considers the length of the split script:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function will no longer produce an IndexError when the script is 'git', and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
