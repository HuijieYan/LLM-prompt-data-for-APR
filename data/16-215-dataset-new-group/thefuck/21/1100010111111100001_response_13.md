The buggy function `match` is designed to match a git command that returns an error containing the string "usage:". The function is failing because it is trying to split `command.script`, which only contains the command "git", causing an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the command is 'stash' before trying to split it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing an index, we can avoid the IndexError. This updated function should pass the failing test.
