### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to a Git stash and if there is an error message in the stderr. The current implementation checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. It seems that the intended logic for checking the command and stderr is not implemented correctly.

### Error Locations
1. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` does not adequately check for the command being related to a Git stash.
2. The comparison `and 'usage:' in command.stderr` might not be effectively checking for the error message in stderr.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect use of the `command.script` and `command.stderr` to check if the command is related to a Git stash and if there is an error message. This leads to incorrect matching of commands and error messages, causing the function to fail the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately identify the command as a Git stash command and correctly check for the error message in the stderr. This can be done by revising the implementation of the `match` function to make accurate comparisons.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The corrected version uses the `in` operator to check if 'stash' is in the command and 'usage:' in the stderr. This should accurately identify Git stash commands and check for the error message in the stderr.
