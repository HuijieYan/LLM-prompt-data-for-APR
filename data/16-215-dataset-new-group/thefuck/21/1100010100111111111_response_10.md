The bug in the `match` function is due to the assumption that the command has at least two words in its `script` attribute, which is not always the case. The bug causes the function to attempt to access the second element of a list that may not have a second element, resulting in an `IndexError`.

To fix this, we need to verify that the `script` attribute of the `command` has at least two words before checking if the second word is 'stash'. If not, the function should return `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will first check if there are at least two words in the `script` attribute before attempting to access the second word. If there are not, it will return `False`, avoiding the `IndexError` that occurred in the buggy version.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case and also satisfy the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted in GitHub regarding the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just `git`.
