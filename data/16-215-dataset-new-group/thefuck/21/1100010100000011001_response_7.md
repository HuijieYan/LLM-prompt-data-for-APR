### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to match a command that includes the word "stash" and has an error message containing "usage:". However, the bug here is that it only checks for the second word in the command script, assuming it to be "stash", which may not always be the case.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function only checks the second word in the command script for 'stash', which may not always be accurate.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:', rather than relying solely on the second word in the command script.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
