#### Explanation
The buggy function is supposed to check if the git command is for stashing changes and if the error message contains the string 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the error message, without considering the position of the 'stash' command in the script.

#### Bug
The bug is in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This condition only checks if 'stash' is the second word in the script, which may not always be the case.

#### Fix
We need to split the command into words and then check if 'stash' is present in the command at all.

#### Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
