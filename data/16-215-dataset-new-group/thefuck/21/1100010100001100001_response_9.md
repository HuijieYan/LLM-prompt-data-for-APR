The buggy function is designed to check whether the command is related to a git stash operation, and whether the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. The function will then return a boolean value based on these conditions.

The bug in the function is that it only checks for the presence of the 'usage:' message in the stderr, but it does not specifically check for the 'git stash' command in the script.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check for both conditions - that the script contains 'git stash' and that the stderr contains the 'usage:' message.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for both conditions and return the correct boolean value based on the input parameters.
