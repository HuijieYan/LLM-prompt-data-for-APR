The bug in the function is causing an IndexError because it is trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without checking if the split returns at least two elements. This is causing the list index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split command returns at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
