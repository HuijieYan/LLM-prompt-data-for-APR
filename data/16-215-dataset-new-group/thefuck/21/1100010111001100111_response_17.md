The issue with the current implementation of the `match` function is that it's expecting the second word in the command to be 'stash', but it doesn't handle cases where the command may have just 'git'. This is indicated by the failing test `test_not_match` and the GitHub issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git".

The `match` function is failing because it attempts to split the script by spaces and access the second element without checking if it exists or not.

To fix this issue, the `match` function should first check if the command script has at least two words before attempting to access the second one.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `script_words` list before accessing the second element, we ensure that the function won't encounter an "index out of range" error when the script contains just 'git'. This fix should make the function pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
