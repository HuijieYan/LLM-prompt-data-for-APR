The problem here is that the buggy function is assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by spaces, leading to an `IndexError` when this assumption is not true.

To fix the bug, we need to check whether `command.script` has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first split the script by spaces, and then check if the resulting list has at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` and fix the bug.

The corrected version of the function satisfies the expected input/output values and should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
