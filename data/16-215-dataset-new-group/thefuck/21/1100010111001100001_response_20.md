The buggy function is designed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the function is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' instead of checking the entire command.

The bug is caused by the incorrect condition in the return statement of the match function. It only checks the second word of the command script instead of the whole command. As a result, the function returns False when it should be True.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the return statement to check if the entire command script starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify the git stash command and pass the failing test.
