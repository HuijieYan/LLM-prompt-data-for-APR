### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the buggy implementation is causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split command.script.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the split command script will always have at least two elements, which is not the case for commands like "git".

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
