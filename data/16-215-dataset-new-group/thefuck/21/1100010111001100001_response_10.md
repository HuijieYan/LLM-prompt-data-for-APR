The buggy function has the following issues:
1. It is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' instead of the first word.
2. It is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the command stderr to determine if it matches, which is not a reliable way to match commands.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking the command script and stderr to determine if it matches.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if the first word in the command script is 'stash'.
2. Use a more reliable method to match the command, such as checking the beginning of the stderr for the expected usage message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[0] == 'git' and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        if command.stderr.startswith('usage: git stash'):
            return True
    return False
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
