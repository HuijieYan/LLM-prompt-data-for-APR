The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a git command is issued for stashing changes, but it currently fails if the command script only contains "git" and does not include any subcommands.

The error is due to the `command.script.split()[1]` line, which tries to access the second element of the split command script. This will result in an `IndexError` if the command script does not contain any additional elements.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if the split command script contains more than one element before checking its content.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function will first check if the split script contains more than one element before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring before.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
