The bug in the `git_fix_stash` function is causing an `IndexError` when the `git` command is used without additional arguments. The bug occurs because the code tries to access the second element of the split command, which doesn't exist when the script is just "git".

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split command has enough elements before attempting to access the second one. We can also modify the condition to check if the first element is "stash" instead of directly accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split command before attempting to access its elements, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
