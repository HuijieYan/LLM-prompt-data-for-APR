The problem with the buggy function is that it is assuming that the command.script will always have at least two elements after splitting it, and it's trying to access the second element directly without any checks.

The failing test and the GitHub issue both show that the problem occurs when the script is just "git", and in that case, the split command will result in a list with only one element. Therefore, accessing the second element of the list will lead to an "IndexError: list index out of range".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the match function to first check if the length of the split list is sufficient before accessing the second element.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the match function will first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the "IndexError" from occurring, and the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
