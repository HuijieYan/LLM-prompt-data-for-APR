The buggy function is designed to check if the input command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. The error message indicates an "IndexError" on line 8, which is likely caused by the "split()" method failing to find the expected element in the list.

The buggy function is incorrectly splitting the command script and comparing the second element directly without checking if it exists. This causes an IndexError when the script doesn't have multiple elements after splitting.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the script has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. Additionally, we should check if the 'usage:' message is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2:
        is_stash_command = script_parts[1] == 'stash'
    else:
        is_stash_command = False

    return is_stash_command and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
