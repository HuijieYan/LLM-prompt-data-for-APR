The buggy function is causing an IndexError because it is trying to access the second element of the split command script, which does not exist if the script is empty. This is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split command script and then access the second element only if it exists. We must also ensure that the command script contains 'git' as the first element, and 'stash' as the second element to accurately match the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1
            and script[0] == 'git'
            and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version ensures that the script has at least two elements and that the first two elements are 'git' and 'stash' before attempting to check for the presence of 'usage:' in the error message.
