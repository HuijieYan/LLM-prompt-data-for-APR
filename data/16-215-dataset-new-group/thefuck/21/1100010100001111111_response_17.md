The buggy function is supposed to match the command if the script is "git" and the stderr contains the word "usage:". However, the current implementation checks if the second word in the script is "stash", which causes an out of range error if the script is only "git".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the script is "git" and the stderr contains "usage:".

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
