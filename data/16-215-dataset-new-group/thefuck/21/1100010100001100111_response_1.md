The bug is caused by the `command.script.split()[1]` statement, which is trying to access the second element of the split command script. However, if the command script has only a single word, this statement will cause an `IndexError` because there is no second element.

To fix this bug, we can check the length of the split command script and ensure that it has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this version, we first split the command script and store the result in the `split_script` variable. Then we check that the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError` issue.
