## Analysis
The buggy function is using the `split()` method on the `command.script` to check if the second word is 'stash', and also checking if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The bug is likely caused by the `split()` method returning an empty list when `command.script` is empty, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `command.script` being empty, which causes the `split()` method to return an empty list. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the empty list.

## Fix Strategy
We need to first check if `command.script` is not empty before applying the `split()` method. If it is empty, we should return `False`. Additionally, we need to consider both conditions together using the `and` operator to ensure that both conditions are met.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if not command.script:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
