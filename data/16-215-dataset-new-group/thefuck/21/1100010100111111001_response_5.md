The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error occurs because the command.script might not have at least two words (the first word is 'git'), and accessing the second word in an empty list causes an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to validate that the script has at least two words before accessing the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
