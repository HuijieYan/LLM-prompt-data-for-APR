The buggy function is designed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. The error message indicates that there is an IndexError, which means that the list index is out of range.

The buggy function attempts to split the script by spaces and then check if the second element is 'stash'. The issue is likely that the script does not contain enough parameters to split, leading to the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split operation will result in a list with at least two elements. If not, we can return False. Then, we can proceed with checking if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if there are at least two parts in the script
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
