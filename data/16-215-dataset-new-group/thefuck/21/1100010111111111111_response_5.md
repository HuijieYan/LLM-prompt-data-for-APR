## The corrected version of the buggy function

In the original buggy function, the `split` method is causing an `IndexError` when the `command.script` does not have enough elements after being split. To fix this, we need to check if the `command.script` has enough elements before trying to access the second one.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py
from thefuck.types import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The corrected version of the function first splits the `command.script` into a list of elements and then checks if the list has more than one element before trying to access the second one. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring, ensuring that the function works as expected with the given test case.
