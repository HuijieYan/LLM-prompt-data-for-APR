The bug in the provided function is that it only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', but it does not consider the possibility of additional arguments. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if 'stash' is the second word in the command, and not just the entire script. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this change, the function will correctly check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This will fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
