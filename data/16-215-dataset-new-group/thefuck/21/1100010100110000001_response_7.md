The buggy function is a part of a Git-specific fix for thefuck package. The function is used to match a command against a specific pattern and determine if it's a match. The error message indicates an "IndexError" which means that the `script` attribute of the `command` is being split into a list and the index being accessed is out of range.

The potential error location within the buggy function is at the line `command.script.split()[1]` because it tries to access the second element of the split result, assuming there will always be at least two elements in the split list.

The cause of the bug is that the script being split does not contain the expected amount of elements, resulting in an IndexError. The script is originating from a Git command and there might be scenarios where the command does not contain the expected number of arguments.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This can be done by adding a condition to check the length of the split result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, the `split_script` variable is used to store the result of splitting the script once, and then its length is checked before accessing the second element. This prevents the IndexError from occurring and should fix the bug.
