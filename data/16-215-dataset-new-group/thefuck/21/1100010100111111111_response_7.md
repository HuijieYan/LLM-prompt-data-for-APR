The buggy function is throwing an IndexError because it is trying to access the second element of the split command.script list without checking if it exists, leading to a "list index out of range" error.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are at least two elements in the split command.script list before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we split the command.script and store it in a variable split_script. Then we check if the length of split_script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.

This corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
