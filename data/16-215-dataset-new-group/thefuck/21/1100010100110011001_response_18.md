### Analysis
The `match` function is supposed to check if the command is for git stash and if there is an error message containing "usage:". The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the function is trying to access an index that does not exist in the split command. This is likely happening because the split method is being called on an empty string.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring in the line `command.script.split()[1]` because if the `command.script` is empty, then `command.script.split()` will result in an empty list, and trying to access index 1 of an empty list will raise an IndexError.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not checking if the `command.script` is empty before trying to split it.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` is not empty before trying to split it. If it's empty, we can return False immediately without continuing with the other checks.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if not command.script:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
