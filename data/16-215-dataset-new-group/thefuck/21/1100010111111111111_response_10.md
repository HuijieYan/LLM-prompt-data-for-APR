## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The cause of the bug is that the original code checked for the second element in the split `command.script`, but it should have been checking the first element. By changing the index from 1 to 0, the function will correctly identify the command as `'git'`.

The correction in the code fixes the bug by checking the correct index of the split `command.script` and also ensures that 'usage:' is in the command's stderr as expected.
