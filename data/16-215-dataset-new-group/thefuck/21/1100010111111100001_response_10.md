The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the string "usage:". However, the current implementation is making an assumption about the structure of the input command without handling cases where the input might not match that structure.

The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the buggy function is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

The buggy function assumes that the input command has at least two elements when using `split()`, which causes the IndexError when the assumption is not met.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the input command has at least two elements before accessing the second element in the split command. We also need to check if the "usage:" string is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the input command has at least two elements before accessing the second element. Then, it checks if "usage:" is present in the stderr. This should address the IndexError and correctly identify if the input command is a git stash command with the "usage:" string in the stderr.
