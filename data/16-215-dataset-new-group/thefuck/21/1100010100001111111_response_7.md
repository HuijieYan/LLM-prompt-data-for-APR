## Bug Fix
The bug occurs because the function `match` is splitting the `command.script` and then checking if the second item in the split list is equal to 'stash'. However, in the case where `command.script` is just 'git', this approach will cause an IndexError because there is no second item in the split list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the first item in the split list is 'stash' before attempting to access the second item. If the first item is 'stash', then we can proceed with the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) >= 2 
        and split_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second one. This will prevent the IndexError and fix the bug.
