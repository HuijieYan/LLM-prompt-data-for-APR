The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the git command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, it fails to consider the case where the git command is just 'git' with no additional arguments.

The bug occurs when the `match` function tries to split the `command.script` and access the second element of the resulting list, causing an `IndexError` when the list is empty.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `match` function to first check if the split list has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the case where the git command is just 'git', and the test case `test_not_match` should pass without raising an `IndexError`.
