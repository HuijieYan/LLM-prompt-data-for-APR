The buggy function `match` is supposed to match the command "git stash" based on the presence of the word "usage:" in the stderr. However, the buggy function is not correctly checking for the command "git stash" and the presence of "usage:" in the stderr.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `(command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is not correctly checking for the command "git stash".
2. The condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr` is not correctly checking for the presence of "usage:" in the stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not correctly identifying the command "git stash" and the presence of "usage:" in the stderr, which causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, the correct strategy is to:
1. Check for the command "git stash" in the script.
2. Check for the presence of "usage:" in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
