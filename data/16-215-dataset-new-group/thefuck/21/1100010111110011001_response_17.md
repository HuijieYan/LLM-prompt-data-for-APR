The buggy function is supposed to check if the git command is for stashing and if the error message contains "usage:". However, the buggy function is causing an IndexError when trying to split the command.script.

The bug is caused by the assumption that the command.script will always contain a second indexed item. This assumption leads to an IndexError when the assumption is not met.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the command.script contains more than one item before trying to access the second item.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fixed version checks if the length of script_parts is greater than 1 before trying to access the second item.
