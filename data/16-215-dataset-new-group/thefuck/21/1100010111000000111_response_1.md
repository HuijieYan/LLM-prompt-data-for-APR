## Cause of the bug
The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`, assuming that it exists, without first checking the length of the list.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, the function should first verify that the length of the split list is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it should return `False`.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
