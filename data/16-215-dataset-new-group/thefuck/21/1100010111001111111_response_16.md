Based on the analysis, the issue seems to be that the function is splitting the command script and then attempting to access the second element of the split list without checking if the list has at least 2 elements.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the split list has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
