### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy implementation is failing with an IndexError due to an attempt to split the command script without checking if it has enough elements.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
