### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to match a git command based on the input `command` and return True if it matches a specific pattern. However, there is a bug in the logic of the function, which will cause it to return incorrect results.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error is in the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` and `and 'usage:' in command.stderr`, which may not accurately determine if the command matches the expected pattern.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison and the use of `command.stderr` without proper validation.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly validate the `command` and use appropriate conditions to check if the command matches the expected pattern.

### Corrected Version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
