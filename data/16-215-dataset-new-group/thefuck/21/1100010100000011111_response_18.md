## Analysis
The buggy function checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. However, the function does not account for cases where the command script may not contain two words, resulting in an IndexError.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function's indexing of the command script without a check for its length causes an IndexError when the script does not contain at least two words.

## Fix Strategy
We need to check the length of the command script before attempting to split it to avoid the IndexError. 

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_words) > 1 
            and command_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
