## The corrected version of the buggy function

def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the original buggy function, there is an issue with the comparison of the command.script value. It is splitting the script by whitespace and comparing the second element with 'stash', which is incorrect. Additionally, there is an issue with the comparison with 'usage:' in the command.stderr.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be based on the first element of the split command.script, and 'usage:' should be checked in the command.stderr.

The corrected version of the function resolves these issues and should pass the failing test.
