The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file fails to handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain elements after splitting by whitespace and where the `command.stderr` does not contain the string 'usage:'.

To fix this bug, we need to add error handling to check if there are elements after splitting the `command.script` and if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr` before attempting to access the elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if there are elements after splitting the `command.script` by whitespace. If there are, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The corrected function addresses the IndexError and ensures that the function returns the expected values.
