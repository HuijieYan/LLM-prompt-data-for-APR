## Explanation
The buggy function `match` encounters an IndexError due to the attempt to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list when the `split()` method returns an empty list. This indicates that the `command.script.split()` method does not split the `command.script` as intended, and that leads to the list index out of range error.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script.split()` returns a non-empty list before trying to access the second element. If it returns an empty list, we can assume that the script does not contain any arguments and therefore does not need further processing.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
