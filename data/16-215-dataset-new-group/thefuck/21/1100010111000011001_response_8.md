### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the git command is "stash" and whether the stderr of the command contains the word "usage:". However, the bug seems to be that the condition for the "stash" command is incorrect.

### Identify potential error locations
The potential error is in the condition: `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. It seems that it's assuming the command is always at the second position after splitting by spaces, which may not always be true.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that the "stash" command is always at the second position in the command script. If the "stash" command is not in the expected position, it will not match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The condition for matching the "stash" command should be more robust and consider different positions of the command within the script.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected function checks if "stash" is present anywhere in the command script, and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This approach will be more robust and should fix the bug.
