The bug occurs because the `command.script` is just "git" and does not contain any additional parameters. So when the buggy function tries to split `command.script`, it results in an empty list, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we can first check the length of the split command before accessing index 1. If the length of the split command is less than 2, we can return False, indicating that the command does not match the condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This corrected version of the function checks the length of the split command, and if it's less than 2, it returns False. Otherwise, it continues with the original logic to check if the command matches the condition. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring in cases where the command only contains "git".
