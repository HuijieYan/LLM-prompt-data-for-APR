The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a command is related to `git stash` and if a specific error message is present in the command's stderr. However, the function currently splits the command script and only checks the second element without validating the length of the split array. This leads to an `IndexError` when the command script is just 'git' without any additional arguments.

To fix this bug, we should first check the length of the split array before accessing the second element. If the length is less than 2, we should return `False` since there is no valid command related to `git stash`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks the length of the split command script and returns `False` if it's less than 2. Otherwise, it proceeds to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the error message is present in the stderr. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
