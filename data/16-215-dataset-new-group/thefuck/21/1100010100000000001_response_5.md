Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function seems to be checking if the command script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, there is no check for potential IndexError if the script does not contain at least two elements after splitting. This could potentially lead to a "list index out of range" error.

Error Locations:
The potential error location is the expression `command.script.split()[1]`. If the `split()` method does not return a list with at least two elements, accessing index 1 will cause an IndexError.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the scenario where the split command does not return at least two elements, leading to an IndexError.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command returns at least two elements before accessing index 1. We can also add additional checks to ensure the presence of 'stash' and 'usage:'.

Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, we first split the command script and assign it to a variable `script_parts`. Then we check if the length of `script_parts` is at least 2 before accessing index 1. If all conditions are met, the function will return True.
