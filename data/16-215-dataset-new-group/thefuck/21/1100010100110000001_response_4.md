The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The error message indicates that there is a `IndexError` because the `command.script` might not have a second word.

To fix this, we can first check if the `command.script` has more than one word before trying to access the second word. If not, we can return `False`. Then, we can check for the presence of 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()

    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    else:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the `command.script` has more than one word, and if it does, it proceeds to check if the word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.
