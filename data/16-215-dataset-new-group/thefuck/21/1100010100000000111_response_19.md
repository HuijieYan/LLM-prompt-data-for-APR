The buggy function `match` is designed to identify when a Git command for stashing changes is not recognized by Git and then suggest the appropriate fix. However, the current implementation has a bug where it splits the command script by whitespace and assumes the second element will be 'stash', leading to an `IndexError` when the script is just 'git' as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the command script contains the word 'stash' before attempting to access the second element. If the word 'stash' is not found in the script, we should return False. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and then proceed to check for 'usage:' in the error output. If the word 'stash' is not found, it will return False, resolving the IndexError issue described in the GitHub report.
