The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if there is a specific error message in the output. However, the index error is caused by attempting to split the command script when it is just `git`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The assumption that the script contains at least two elements after being split.

The cause of the bug is the faulty assumption that the `command.script` would always have at least two elements after being split. When the script is just "git", it will result in an empty list after the split operation, and attempting to access the second element will result in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to check the length of the split result before attempting to access the second element of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the length of `parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element, we ensure that a list index out of range error will not occur. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
