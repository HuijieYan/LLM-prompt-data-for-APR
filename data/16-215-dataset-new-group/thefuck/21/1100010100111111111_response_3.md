To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script` does not have at least two elements after splitting. We can do this by checking the length of the split result before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will now first check if there are at least two elements in the split result before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError that was occurring before.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to the bug.
