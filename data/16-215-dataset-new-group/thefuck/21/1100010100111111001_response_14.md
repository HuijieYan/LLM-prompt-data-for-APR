The bug in the `match` function is an `IndexError` that occurs because the `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access an index that does not exist when the `command.script` does not contain any spaces.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the splitted script is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function checks whether the length of the split script is greater than 1 before comparing the second element with 'stash' and checking for 'usage:' in the stderr.

This correction ensures that the function does not attempt to access the second element of the split script when it does not exist, thus fixing the `IndexError` and resulting in the correct behavior for the failing test case.
