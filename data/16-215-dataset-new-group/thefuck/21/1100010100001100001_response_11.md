The buggy function is supposed to check if the second word in the command is "stash" and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". However, the current implementation splits the script by spaces and checks only the second word. This will cause the function to return False when the actual input script is 'git stash'.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to check if the second word in the script is "stash" and if the stderr contains the word "usage:", regardless of its position in the string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
