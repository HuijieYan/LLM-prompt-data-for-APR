The bug occurs because the function is attempting to access the second element of `command.script.split()`, even when the split list may have fewer elements. This results in the "IndexError: list index out of range" when the split list only contains one element.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the resulting list in `script_parts`. We then check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element. This prevents the "IndexError" from occurring when the split list does not have enough elements.
