### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `match` is attempting to split `command.script` into a list and then access the second element without checking if it exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when the command string does not contain at least two space-separated elements. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` can be safely split into a list before attempting to access the second element.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
