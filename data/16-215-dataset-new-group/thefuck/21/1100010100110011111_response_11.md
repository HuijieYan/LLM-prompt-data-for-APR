To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` list has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. We can also check if the first element is equal to 'git' to ensure that the script is actually a git command. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function will first check if the `command.script` list has at least 2 elements and that the first element is 'git', before trying to access the second element. This should resolve the IndexError that was occurring when the script was just 'git' without any additional arguments. This fix should also resolve the GitHub issue for the bug.
