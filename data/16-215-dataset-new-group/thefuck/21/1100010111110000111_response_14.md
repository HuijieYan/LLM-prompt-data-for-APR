### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is expecting a `command` with a script that contains the word "stash" and has a "usage:" line in the stderr.

### Identifying the Bug
The bug occurs due to the assumption that `command.script` always contains at least two elements, with the second element being 'stash'. In the failing test, a `Command` object with the script "git" is passed, causing the `command.script.split()[1]` to raise an IndexError.

### Cause of Bug
The buggy function attempts to access the second element of the split `command.script`. However, if the `script` is "git" alone, the split would result in only one element in the list, causing the IndexError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We should modify the buggy function to check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, the function should return False.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
