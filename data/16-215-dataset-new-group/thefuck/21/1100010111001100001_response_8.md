The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if there is an error message indicating the usage of the stash command in the stderr. However, the current implementation is checking for the presence of the entire error message, which is not flexible or accurate.

The bug is caused by the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which only checks for the presence of the word "stash" in the command, and 'usage:' in command.stderr which checks for the exact presence of the entire error message.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check for the presence of both "stash" in the command and "usage:" in the error message independently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return 'stash' in script_parts and any('usage:' in error for error in command.stderr.split('\n'))
```

This updated version splits the command script and checks if "stash" is present in the split parts. It also splits the stderr by lines and checks if any line contains the "usage:" message. This way, the function is more flexible and accurately checks for the conditions required for matching a git stash command.
