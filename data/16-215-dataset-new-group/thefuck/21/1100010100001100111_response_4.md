The bug occurs when the `git_fix_stash` rule fails to handle cases where the command is simply `'git'`. The current function checks if the second word in the command is `'stash'`, but when the command is just `'git'`, this check fails and leads to an IndexError due to trying to access a non-existent element in the split list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle the case where the command is simply `'git'`. We can do this by first checking if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splited_script) >= 2:
        return (splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script into a list of words. Then, we check if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If not, we return `False` immediately.

This fix should address the bug and allow the `git_fix_stash` rule to handle cases where the command is simply `'git'`.
