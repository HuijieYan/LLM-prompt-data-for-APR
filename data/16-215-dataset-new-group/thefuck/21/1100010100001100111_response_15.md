The bug in the current function is that it assumes the command has at least two elements when split by whitespace, which leads to an IndexError when accessing the second element of the split command. The buggy function only checks if the second element of the split command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking if the split command has at least two elements, we avoid the IndexError that was occurring in the buggy function. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the function more robust.
