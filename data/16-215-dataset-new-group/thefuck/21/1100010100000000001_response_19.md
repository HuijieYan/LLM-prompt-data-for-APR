## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is meant to check if a git command is a "stash" command and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". 

## Potential Error Locations
1. The function does not handle cases where the command does not have at least two words after splitting by spaces.
2. It assumes that the 'stash' command will always be the second word in the command script.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that the 'stash' command will always be the second word in the command script. This could lead to an index out of range error if the command has less than two words. 

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Check the length of the split command script before accessing the second word to avoid index out of range errors.
- Use string matching or regular expressions to check if the command is a 'stash' command.

## The Corrected Version
```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    command_words = command.script.split()
    if len(command_words) >= 2 and command_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
