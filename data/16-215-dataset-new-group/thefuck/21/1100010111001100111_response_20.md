Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, the buggy function is failing because it is trying to access an index that does not exist in the split of `command.script`. The `command.script` is being split and the second element is being accessed, which may not always exist.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to first check if the split of `command.script` has at least one element before attempting to access the second element. If it does, we can then check if it is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should no longer raise an IndexError, and it should pass the failing test.
