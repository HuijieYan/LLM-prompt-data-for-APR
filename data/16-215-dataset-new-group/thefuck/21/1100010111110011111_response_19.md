## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

I changed the `match` function to include a check for the length of the split `command.script` to ensure that the index we are trying to access exists. This should prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the previous version.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
