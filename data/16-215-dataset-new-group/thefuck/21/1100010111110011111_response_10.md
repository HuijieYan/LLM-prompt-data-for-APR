### Error Locations
1. Potential IndexError in the match function due to using `split()[1]` on the `command.script` without checking if it has at least 2 elements after splitting.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function `match` is causing an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element of the split `command.script` without checking if the split result has at least two elements. The failing test `test_not_match` uses the `match` function and expects it to return `False` because of the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, add a check to ensure that the split `command.script` has at least two elements before accessing the second element. If not, the function should return `False`.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
