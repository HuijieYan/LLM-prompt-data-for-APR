## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The buggy function is using the `command.script.split()[1]` to check if the second part of the command is 'stash', and it's also checking whether 'usage:' is in the stderr. The issue seems to occur due to the split failing.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the provided information
The command.script.split() is probably returning an empty list because the script does not have any spaces to split on, or it doesn't have a second part. This results in an IndexError when checking `split()[1]`.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
We can use error handling to address the issue when the split doesn't return a second element.

## Provide the corrected version of the function
Here's the corrected version of the function, with error handling to prevent the IndexError:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
