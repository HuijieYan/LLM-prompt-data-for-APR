## Fixing the bug

The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the script by whitespace and then check if the second element is 'stash'. The bug occurs when the script is just 'git' and does not contain 'stash'. This causes the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to also check if the script length is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
