The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a git command does not match the usage of the stash command. The bug appears to be with the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which would cause an index out of range error if the command.script is not long enough.

To fix the bug, we need to first make sure that the script is long enough before attempting to access index 1. We can also check if the first part of the command is 'git', to ensure it is a git command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) > 1 
            and command_parts[0] == 'git'
            and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly check if the command is a git stash command and if the usage is present in the stderr. This correction should ensure that the failing test will pass.
