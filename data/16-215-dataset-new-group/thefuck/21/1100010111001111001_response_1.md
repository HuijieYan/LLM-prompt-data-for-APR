The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr of the command contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', which is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function only checks for the second word in the command script and does not check if the stderr contains the expected phrase.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to properly check both the command script and the stderr for the expected conditions.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. This will fulfill the expected input/output values and fix the bug.
