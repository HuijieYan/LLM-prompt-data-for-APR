### Analysis
The given buggy function is designed to match if the command script is 'git stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. It seems that the buggy function is trying to split the command script and access the second element, but there's an issue with the split operation. The provided GitHub issue confirms that there's an IndexError occurring in the code due to a list index out of range.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is an assumption that the command script will always contain at least two elements after splitting, which is not always the case. This assumption leads to the IndexError when accessing the second element.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it means the split array does not contain the expected number of elements, and we should return False.

### Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
