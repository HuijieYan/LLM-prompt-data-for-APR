The bug in the `match` function is causing an IndexError. The function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second word, causing an IndexError when trying to access `split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` has more than one word before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this fixed version, we first check if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 before accessing `script_words[1]`. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring, resolving the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
