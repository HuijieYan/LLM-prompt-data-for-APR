The issue with the buggy function is that it is assuming the presence of a specific command in the script part of the input. However, the failing test provides an input where the script part is just "git", without a specific command like "stash". This causes an `IndexError` because the buggy function tries to access the second element of the split script which doesn't exist in this case.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the script part contains the "stash" command before splitting it and trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
