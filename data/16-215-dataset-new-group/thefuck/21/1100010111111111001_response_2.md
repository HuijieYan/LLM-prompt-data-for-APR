The cause of the bug is the command.script.split()[1] is trying to access the second element of the split command.script, but in this case, the split list has only one element, so the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split command.script list is greater than 1 before trying to access its second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function should handle the case where the split command.script list has only one element, preventing the index out of range error.
