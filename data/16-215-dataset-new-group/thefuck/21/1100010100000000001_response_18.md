## Analysis of the buggy function:
The buggy function is supposed to match the "git stash" command, but it has a potential error in checking the presence of the word "usage:" in the command's stderr.

## Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the second word in the command script with 'stash'.
2. Checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the command's stderr.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking if the command is 'git stash' and instead relies on the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, which may not always be reliable.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
We should verify that the command is 'git stash' in a more robust way, and then handle the error based on specific conditions rather than relying solely on the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script_parts
    if len(parts) >= 2 and parts[1] == 'stash':
        return True
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we split the command script and check if the second part is 'stash'. We return True if it is, and False otherwise. This provides a more reliable way of matching the 'git stash' command.
