The buggy function is supposed to check if the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command stderr. However, it seems to be failing because it's trying to split the command script and causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the list.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is assuming that the script of the command will always contain at least two elements, and is directly accessing the second element of the split script without any error handling.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version of the function first splits the command script and then checks if the split script contains at least two elements, and then continues with the comparison as before. This should fix the IndexError and make the function work as intended.
