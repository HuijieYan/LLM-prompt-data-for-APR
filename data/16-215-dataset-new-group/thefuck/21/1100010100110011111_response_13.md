## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the command matches the pattern of a 'git stash' command and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string. The bug appears to be caused by trying to split the command.script without first checking if there are elements to split.

## Bug Locations
1. The buggy line is the `command.script.split()[1]` line, which tries to access the second element of the split list without checking if it exists.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that the 'git stash' command is present in the `command.script`. However, if the command is just 'git' without additional arguments, the split operation will result in an empty list, causing an IndexError when trying to access its second element.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected function first splits the command.script and then checks if the split list contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will ensure that there is no IndexError when trying to access the second element of the list.
