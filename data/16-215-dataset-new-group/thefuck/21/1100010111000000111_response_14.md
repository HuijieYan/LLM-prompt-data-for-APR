The buggy function is causing an "IndexError: list index out of range" because it is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if the command actually has a second element or not.

To fix this bug, we can modify the match function to first check if the command has at least two elements in the script before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the match function will first check if the command has at least two elements in the script before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This should resolve the IndexError and make the function pass the failing test.
