The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the git command is related to stashing and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy function does not properly perform this check, causing the failing test.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` may not work if the command is not formatted exactly as expected.
2. The check for 'usage:' in the stderr may not be accurate.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not correctly checking if the command is related to stashing and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. This causes the failing test as the buggy function incorrectly returns a match when it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, we can update the match function to use better checks for the command and stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(command_parts) > 1 and command_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script and check if the second part is 'stash'. Then we check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. If both conditions are true, we return True, otherwise, we return False.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
