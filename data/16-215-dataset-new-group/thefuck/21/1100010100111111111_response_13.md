To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to ensure that the command script is split into a list of words before checking for the second word in the list to avoid the "IndexError: list index out of range" when the command script is just "git". We can also add a check to verify that the command.stderr contains the word "stash" to match the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'stash' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a check for the length of the words before attempting to access the second word, we can avoid the IndexError. Additionally, we ensure that the word "stash" is present in the command.stderr to match the expected behavior. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
