### Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to split the command script and access the second element without checking if it exists, which is causing an IndexError. Additionally, the function is checking for the presence of 'usage:' in the command's stderr. 

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that the command script will always have at least two elements when split, which is not always the case. This causes an IndexError. Additionally, the function doesn't check if the command is actually 'stash'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the command script has at least two elements before accessing the second element.
2. Check if the command is actually 'stash' before further processing.
3. Use a try-except block to handle any potential IndexError.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
