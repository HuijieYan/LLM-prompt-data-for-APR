The buggy function is trying to match the command input with the string 'stash' and check if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, it only checks the first word of the command.script and doesn't consider the entire string.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of split command.script with the word 'stash', and the incomplete comparison of 'usage:' in command.stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to split the entire command.script and compare each word with 'stash', and check if the entire 'usage:' string is present in command.stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in split_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we split the entire command.script and check if 'stash' is present in any of the words. We also check if the entire 'usage:' string is present in command.stderr.
