The buggy function `match` is supposed to check whether a git command refers to the `stash` functionality and has a specific error message in the stderr. The function seems to be throwing an `IndexError` when trying to split the `command.script`.

The bug is likely caused by assuming that the command script will always have at least two elements when split. However, the failing test shows that the command script provided is just "git", and hence when trying to access the second element by index, it is throwing an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split script is greater than one, indicating that the script has at least two elements, before trying to access the second element by index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
