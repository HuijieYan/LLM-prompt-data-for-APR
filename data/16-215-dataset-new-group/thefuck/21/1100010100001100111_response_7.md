## Analysis
The buggy function is trying to match if the git command is used with 'stash' as the second argument and if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr. However, the buggy function does not check if the `command.script` has more than one element before indexing it, which causes the IndexError seen in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function is assuming that `command.script` has at least two elements, but when the script is just 'git', it only has one element, leading to the IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the function needs to check if the script has more than one element before attempting to access the second element.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and
            script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
