The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is failing when the `command.script` only contains `'git'`. The function checks if the second element in the split `command.script` is equal to `'stash'`, and also checks if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. However, when `command.script` is just `'git'`, the split command returns a single element list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before accessing the second element. We should also check for the presence of 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and
            split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that we only check the second element of the split command if the length of the split command is greater than 1, preventing the `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `'git'`.
