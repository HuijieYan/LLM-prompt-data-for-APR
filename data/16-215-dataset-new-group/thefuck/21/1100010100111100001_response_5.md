The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` string and then check if the second element is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, the error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range," which means that the `split` function is not creating a list with at least two elements, leading to an out-of-range index access.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `split` result contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the `split` result contains at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
