The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when using the `split()` method. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the `command.script.split()` list is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This change ensures that we only try to access the second element of the `split_script` list if it contains at least two elements. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
