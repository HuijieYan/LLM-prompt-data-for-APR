The issue is that the `match` function is throwing an IndexError because it's trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()`. However, when the script is just "git" with no additional arguments, `command.script.split()` will only contain one element, and accessing the second element will throw an IndexError.

To fix this, we can check the length of `command.script.split()` before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError when the script is just "git".
