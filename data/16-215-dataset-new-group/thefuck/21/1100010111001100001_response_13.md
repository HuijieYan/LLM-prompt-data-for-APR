## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By analyzing the provided buggy function and the failing test, it is evident that the bug lies in the comparison of the input command.script. The buggy function mistakenly compares the second element of the split command.script with 'stash', when it should be comparing the first element with 'git'.

To fix the bug, I have corrected the comparison inside the match function by using command.script.split()[0] instead of command.script.split()[1].

After applying the fix and using the corrected version of the function provided above, it should pass the failing test successfully.
