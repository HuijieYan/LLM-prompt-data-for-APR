### Analysis
The buggy function, `match`, takes a `command` object as input and checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. 

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error in the `match` function could be the comparison of the second word of the command script with 'stash' and the check for 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Cause of the bug
The bug in the function is that it does not correctly check if the second word is 'stash' in the command script. It only compares the second word with 'stash' without considering the command script structure.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `match` function needs to parse the command script properly and check for the 'stash' command along with 'usage:' in the stderr.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
