### Bug Analysis
The bug is causing an "IndexError: list index out of range" because the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without verifying that there are at least two elements in the list.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the buggy function is the statement `command.script.split()[1]`.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function `match` tries to access the second element of the list produced by splitting `command.script`. However, when the `command.script` is just "git", this list will have only one element, resulting in an IndexError. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to introduce a check to ensure the list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
