The buggy function `match` is failing due to an IndexError: list index out of range. This is likely because the function is attempting to access the second element in `command.script.split()`, which is causing an error because `command.script` may not contain at least two elements after splitting.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if the split list contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification first stores the result of `command.script.split()` in a variable `script_split` and then checks if it contains at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted in GitHub regarding the git_fix_stash rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
