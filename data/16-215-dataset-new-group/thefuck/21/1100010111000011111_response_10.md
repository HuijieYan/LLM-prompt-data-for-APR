The buggy function `match` is intended to match a command that starts with `git stash` and contains the string 'usage:' in the error output. The failing test `test_not_match` is expecting the function to not match a command where the stderr contains a specific error message related to `git stash`.

The buggy function is failing because it is assuming that the command will always have the pattern "git stash" as the script's second word, causing an `IndexError` when trying to split the script by spaces.

To fix this bug, the function `match` needs to validate the input parameters to avoid errors related to accessing elements out of the list's bounds. It should first check if the script contains 'git stash', and then check if 'usage:' is in the error output.

The corrected version of the function is shown below:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        if script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
            return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
