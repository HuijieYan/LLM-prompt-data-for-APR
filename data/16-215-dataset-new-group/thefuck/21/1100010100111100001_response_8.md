The buggy function is supposed to check whether the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, there is an error occurring due to the use of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split actually contains more than one element. 

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script.split()` is returning a list with only one element, and trying to access index 1 is causing an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the split contains at least two elements before attempting to access index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
