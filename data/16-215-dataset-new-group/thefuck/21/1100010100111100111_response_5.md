The bug in the function `match` is causing an IndexError when the `command.script` is just `'git'` and the `command.stderr` contains the usage information for `git stash`. The bug is found at the line `command.script.split()[1]` where the split operation does not provide more than one element in the list, causing an index out of range.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before trying to access the second element in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version of the function checks the length of `script_parts` before trying to access the second element. This should prevent the IndexError and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
