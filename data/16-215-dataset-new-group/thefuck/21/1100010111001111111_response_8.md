The bug in the `match` function is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` will always have at least two words. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word of the split script.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) > 1:
        return (words[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will now first check if the `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word. This will prevent the `IndexError` and fix the bug.
