### Analysis:
The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the buggy function is encountering an issue with accessing an index of a list that does not exist.

### Identified potential error locations:
The potential error location is the `command.script.split()[1]` part of the `return` statement. If the `command.script` does not contain multiple elements separated by spaces, this could cause an index out of range error.

### Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` and then access the second element `[1]` of the resulting list. If there is no second element in the list, this will cause an `IndexError` since the index is out of range.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can first check if the split list has a length greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element.

### The corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.
