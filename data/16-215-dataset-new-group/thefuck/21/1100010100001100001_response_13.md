The buggy function is supposed to match the git command with 'stash' and check if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command.script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

The bug seems to be in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The bug is likely caused by the assumption that the second word in the command.script is always 'stash' without checking if it exists. Additionally, the check for 'usage:' in command.stderr may not be sufficient to determine if the usage message is present.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the command.script contains 'stash' and if it does, then check if 'usage:' is in command.stderr. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script.split():
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```
