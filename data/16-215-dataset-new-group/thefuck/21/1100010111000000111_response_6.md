The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule causes an `IndexError` because the `match` function is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `match` function to first check if there is at least one argument in the script before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_args = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_args) > 1 and script_args[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the script into its individual arguments and then check if there are at least two arguments and if the second argument is 'stash'. Only then will it proceed to check for the presence of 'usage:' in the command's stderr.

With this fix, the `match` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
