The issue is that the `match` function is assuming that the command script will always have at least two words, and it will split the script and check if the second word is 'stash'. However, in this case, the command script is just 'git', so when splitting it, there is only one element in the resulting list, causing the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
```
