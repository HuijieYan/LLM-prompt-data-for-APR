The bug in the function `match` is that it assumes that `command.script` will have at least two words in it. However, in the failing test, the `command.script` is just "git" and does not contain "stash". This causes the `command.script.split()[1]` to fail with an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the `command.script` starts with "git stash" before checking the `command.stderr` for "usage:".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
