The bug occurs because the function doesn't account for cases when the `command.script` doesn't have a second word after splitting by spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command.script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and then check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This change will prevent the "IndexError: list index out of range" from occurring and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
