The buggy function is currently checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, this approach is problematic because it does not accurately match the command structure. Additionally, the comparison with the stderr may not be reliable due to potential variations in the output text.

To fix the bug, we should first:
- Check if the command starts with 'git stash', rather than just checking for the second word.
- Use a more reliable approach to check for the command structure, such as regex or parsing the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    return re.match(r'git\s+stash\b', command.script) and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By using regular expressions to match the command structure, we can ensure a more accurate and reliable check for the desired command. This corrected version should address the bug and provide the expected behavior.
