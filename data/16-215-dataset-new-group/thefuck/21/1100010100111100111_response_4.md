The bug is in the `match` function of the file `git_fix_stash.py`. The function is failing with an IndexError due to attempting to access the second element of the list `command.script.split()`, without checking if the list has at least two elements. This is likely because the script is just `'git'`, and there is no second element after the split.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If it does not, then the function should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split command has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, it will proceed with the original matching logic.

This corrected version should resolve the IndexError and allow the `match` function to work as intended.
