The bug in the `match` function is that it is checking for the presence of the entire error message in the `stderr`, when it should only be checking for the presence of the word "usage:". This is causing the function to return False when it should be True.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition in the return statement to check if "usage:" is in the `command.stderr` instead of checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case.
