The buggy function has an issue with trying to access the second element of the command script input without checking if there are enough elements in the split list. This causes an IndexError when the script is just "git" without any other arguments. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list is long enough before trying to access its elements. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split list before accessing its elements, we can prevent the IndexError and ensure that the function works as expected, passing the failing test case. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
