The bug in the function `match` is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` will always contain a second word after splitting the string. In this particular case, the `command.script` only contains one word, 'git', causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second index after splitting the string.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split `command.script` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.types import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command: Command) -> bool:
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version checks the length of the split `command.script`, and only then tries to access the second index to compare it with 'stash'. This should fix the `IndexError` issue.
