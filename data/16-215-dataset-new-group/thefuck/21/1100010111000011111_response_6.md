### Analysis
The `match` function checks if the command script contains the keyword 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. 

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The `split` method will raise an IndexError if the `command.script` is empty.
2. The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` does not check if the command script contains 'git'.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that the command script has at least two elements after splitting, which may not always be the case. In the failing test case, the `command.script` is 'git', so the function raises an IndexError trying to access index 1.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Correctly check if the command script is referring to 'git'.
2. Check if the command.script contains 'stash' and the command.stderr contains 'usage:' in two separate conditions.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'git' in command.script and 'stash' in command.script:
        if 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return True
    return False
```
