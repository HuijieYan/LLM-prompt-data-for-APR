The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the given command is related to git stash and whether the usage message is present in the stderr. However, the buggy function is failing with an `IndexError` because it is trying to split the `command.script` and access its second element without checking if it exists or not.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also check if the first element is 'git' to ensure that the command is actually a git command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[0] == 'git':
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this corrected version, the function will first check if the command has at least two elements and if the first element is 'git'. Then it will proceed to check for 'stash' and the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. This should fix the `IndexError` and make the function pass the failing test.
