The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command matches "git stash" and if the stderr contains the string "usage:". However, the function fails with an IndexError due to an attempt to access the index `1` of the split script, which is out of range.

The issue is that the script is split by whitespace, and if there is no second word, it will cause an IndexError. This happens when the command is not "git stash" or if there are no additional parameters after "git stash".

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least 2 words before trying to access index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version checks if there are at least 2 words in the script before trying to access index 1, which resolves the IndexError.
