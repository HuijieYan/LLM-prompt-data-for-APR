The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is causing an IndexError when the `command.script` is just `'git'`. This is because the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split `command.script`, which does not exist.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `match` function to first check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `match` function will first check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before accessing the second element, thus preventing the IndexError when `command.script` is just `'git'`. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
