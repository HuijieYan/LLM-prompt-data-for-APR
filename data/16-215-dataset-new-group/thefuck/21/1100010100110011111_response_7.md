The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the shell command is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the error output. The error message 'IndexError: list index out of range' implies that the split operation `command.script.split()[1]` is failing because there are no words in the script. This likely occurs when the input command is simply 'git', causing the split operation to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the script is just 'git' and avoid splitting an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, when the input command is simply 'git', the function will return False, and the IndexError will be avoided. This will handle the case where the split operation fails due to an empty script.
