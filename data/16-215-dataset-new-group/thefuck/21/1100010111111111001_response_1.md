## Bug Explanation
The buggy function attempts to split the `command.script` and check if the second word is 'stash', and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, if the `command.script` does not contain a second word, it will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `split()[1]`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before attempting to access `split()[1]`. If it does, then we can proceed with the comparison.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
