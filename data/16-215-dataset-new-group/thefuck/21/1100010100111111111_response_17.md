The buggy function is failing because it is assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split, which is not the case when the script is just 'git'. This causes an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split command.script.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the split command.script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If it does not have at least two elements, we can safely return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
