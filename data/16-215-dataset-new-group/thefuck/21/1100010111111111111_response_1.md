The buggy function `match` is failing the test `test_not_match`. The cause of the bug is an `IndexError` occurring on the line `command.script.split()[1]` when the `command.script` has only one element. The function is assuming the second element will always be 'stash'. To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
