The buggy function is designed to check if the command is related to the git stash and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, at the buggy function's return, the function tries to split the script, causing the error "IndexError: list index out of range". 

To fix the bug, we can first check if the script contains the command 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. If these conditions are met, then the function should return True, indicating a match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
