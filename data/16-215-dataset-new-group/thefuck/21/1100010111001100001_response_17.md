The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the input parameters and the behavior of the function indicate that it's not correctly identifying when to match.

The cause of the bug is that the function is only checking for the second word in the command script to be 'stash', which is not sufficient for matching the correct command.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the command.script starts with 'git stash'. Then, it should also check if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function correctly checks if the command starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr, ensuring a proper match with the expected behavior.
