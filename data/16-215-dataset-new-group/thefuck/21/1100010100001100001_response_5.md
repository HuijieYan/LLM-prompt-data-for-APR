The buggy function is intended to check if the command is related to git stash and if the usage information is present in the stderr. However, the current implementation only checks if the second element in the script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This can lead to incorrect results.

The issue lies in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, as it only checks the second word in the command script, which may not accurately represent the whole command that was executed. 

A more robust approach would be to check if the command starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr, providing a more accurate match for the git stash command.
