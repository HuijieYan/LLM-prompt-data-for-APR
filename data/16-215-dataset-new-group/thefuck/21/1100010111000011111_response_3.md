The buggy function is intended to check if the command is related to git stash and if the usage message is present in the stderr. However, the function is causing an `IndexError` when it tries to access the second element of the split command script.

The bug is present in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. It attempts to split the command script and access its second element without checking if the list has at least two elements, which results in an `IndexError` when the list is empty. 

To fix the bug, we should first check if the command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should no longer raise an `IndexError` and should pass the failing test case. It should also satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned.
