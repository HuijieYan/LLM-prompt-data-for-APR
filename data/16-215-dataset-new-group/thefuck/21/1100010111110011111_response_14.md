The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` and compare the second item to 'stash'. The failing test is checking for a scenario where the stderr contains 'usage:', which would lead to an IndexError when the buggy function attempts to split `command.script`.

The crashing bug occurs because the buggy function attempts to split `command.script` without checking its content, leading to an IndexError when the script is just 'git' with no additional arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure `command.script` is not empty before attempting to split it. If it is empty or does not contain at least two words, the function should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first checks if the length of words split from `command.script` is greater than 1. If it is, it then performs the comparison and checks for 'usage:' in the command's stderr. If these conditions are satisfied, the function returns True, indicating a match. If not, it returns False.

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the git_fix_stash rule.
