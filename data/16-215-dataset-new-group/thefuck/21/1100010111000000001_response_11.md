The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly checking for the presence of the 'git stash' command in the input `command`. It is also not properly handling the `git_stash_err` input in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The check for the presence of 'git stash' command in the input `command`.
2. The error handling for the `git_stash_err` input in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `match` function does not correctly check for the 'git stash' command and does not handle the `git_stash_err` input in the failing test, causing it to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check for the presence of 'git stash' command more robustly in the `command`.
2. Properly handle the `git_stash_err` input in the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With these corrections, the `match` function now correctly checks for the presence of 'git stash' command and properly handles the `git_stash_err` input in the failing test, ensuring that it passes the test.
