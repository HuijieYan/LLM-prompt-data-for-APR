The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just 'git' because the buggy function is trying to split the command script and access the second element without checking if it exists, which causes an `IndexError` when the script is just 'git'.

To fix the bug, we should first check the length of the splited_script and then check the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version of the function checks the length of the `splited_script` list to ensure that it has more than one element before accessing the second element. This fix should resolve the IndexError that was causing the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.
