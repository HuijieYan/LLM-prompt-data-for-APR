The bug in the function is that it is trying to split the script attribute of the command, but it is not checking if the length of the split result is at least 2, causing an IndexError when it tries to access the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. If not, the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
