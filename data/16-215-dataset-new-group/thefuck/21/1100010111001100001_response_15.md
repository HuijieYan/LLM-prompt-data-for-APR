The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script is related to Git stash and if the stderr contains the phrase "usage:". However, it is currently checking only the second word of the command script and does not consider the full stderr message.

The potential error location is in the return statement of the `match` function, where it checks only the second word of the command script and the presence of "usage:" in the stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly checking for the entire `git stash` command and the complete "usage:" message in the stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `match` function to correctly check for the `git stash` command in the script and verify that the complete "usage:" message is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1 and
        script_parts[0] == 'git' and
        script_parts[1] == 'stash' and
        'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check for the full `git stash` command in the script and ensure that the "usage:" message is present in the stderr.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
