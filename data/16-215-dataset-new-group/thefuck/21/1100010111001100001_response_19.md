The buggy function `match` checks if the input command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. The issue with the current implementation is that it only checks for the exact string 'usage:', whereas the stderr might contain additional characters.

The cause of the bug is the use of a strict equality check for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, which may lead to false negatives if the stderr contains additional characters.

To fix the bug, we can use the `in` keyword to check if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This will make the check more flexible and account for any additional characters in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly match the git stash command and check for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.
