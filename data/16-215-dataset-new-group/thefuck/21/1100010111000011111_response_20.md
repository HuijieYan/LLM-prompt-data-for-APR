### Analysis
The `match` function is designed to check if the git command is to stash and if the 'usage:' string is in the stderr of the command. The failing test is using a `Command` object with the script "git" and sets the stderr to a value `git_stash_err`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The use of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if there is a second element after splitting the script.
2. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` might be sensitive to the input provided.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()[1]` has a second element, which may not always be the case. This causes the IndexError when trying to access the element that doesn't exist. The failing test indicates that the function is failing to handle the 'git' command when used with empty stderr.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `command.script.split()` may not have a second element. This can be done by first checking the length of the list before trying to access the second element.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

The corrected version of the `match` function first checks if there are more than one elements after splitting the `command.script`. If there are, it then proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. If there is only one or no element, it returns False, indicating that the condition is not met. This should handle the case where the `git` command is provided with no additional arguments.
