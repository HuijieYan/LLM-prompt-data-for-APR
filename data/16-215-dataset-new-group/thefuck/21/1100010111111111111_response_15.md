To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to address the issue of the list index being out of range when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`. This means that the `command.script` does not contain the expected input. 

In the failing test, the input `command.script` is 'git', but the function is expecting a script that contains 'stash' at the second position after splitting by whitespace. This results in an IndexError when the function tries to access index 1, as the list resulting from `command.script.split()` only contains one element ('git').

To fix the bug, we can first check that the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script contains at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element at index 1.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted in GitHub about the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
