```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# Here's the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function used `command.script.split()[1]` to extract the second word from the command, assuming it would always be 'stash'. However, when the command is just 'git', it raised an IndexError because there was no second word.

To fix this, we need to first check if the split command has more than one element, and then perform the comparison.

By adding `len(command.script.split()) > 1` as a condition to check that there are multiple words in the command, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
