The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is caused by the `IndexError: list index out of range` error. This error indicates that the `command.script.split()` function is not able to split the `command.script` as expected, leading to an empty list and causing the subsequent indexing error.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains multiple elements before attempting to split it and access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the resulting list in the variable `script_parts`. Then we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. If the length is greater than 1, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
