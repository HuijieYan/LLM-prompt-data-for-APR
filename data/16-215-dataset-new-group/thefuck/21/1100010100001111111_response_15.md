The buggy function is supposed to check if the command script is 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the current implementation is using split() method without checking if there are enough elements in the returned list, which results in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split result has enough elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version checks if the split_script has more than one element before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This fix addresses the issue with the original buggy function and ensures that it properly handles the split result to avoid IndexError.
