The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the git command is related to stashing and the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy function has an index error since it assumes that the input command has at least two items when split, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) >= 2
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `split_command` before accessing the second element, we can avoid the index error. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
