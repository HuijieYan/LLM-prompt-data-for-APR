The buggy function is designed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, which is not a reliable way to determine if the command is related to `git stash`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the command starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (split_script[0] == 'git' and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
