The buggy function has an error because it assumes that the command's script will always have at least two elements when split, which is not true when the command is just "git". This assumption causes the buggy function to crash when trying to access the second element of the split script.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will not crash when the command is just "git", and should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
