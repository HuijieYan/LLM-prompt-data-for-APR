## Revised Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[0] != 'git':
        return False
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

Explanation:
- The original function checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', but it should also check if the first word is 'git'.
- The bug was caused by the function not handling cases where the command was just 'git' without any additional arguments.
- The revised function checks if the first word in the command script is 'git' and then checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.
- This handles the case where the command is just 'git' and resolves the IndexError bug from the failing test and GitHub issue.

Now, the revised function should pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
