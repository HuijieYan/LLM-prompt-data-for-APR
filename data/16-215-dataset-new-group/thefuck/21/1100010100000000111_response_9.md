## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is meant to check if the command is related to `git stash` and whether the stderr contains the message 'usage:'. However, the bug seems to be occurring when the command is just 'git' without any other arguments. This is causing an IndexError when trying to split the command script.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is where the function tries to split the command script and access the second element of the resulting list.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that the command has more than one argument when splitting the script, which is not true when the command is just 'git'.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
A strategy to fix this bug is to first check if the split command has the expected number of elements before accessing the second element. If the command has only one element, it means it's just 'git', and the function should return False in this case.

## Bug Fix
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
