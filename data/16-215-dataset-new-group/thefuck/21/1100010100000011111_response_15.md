The buggy function is designed to check if the input command is a git stash command by splitting the command.script and checking for the word "stash", while also checking for the presence of the word "usage:" in the command.stderr. However, the function does not account for the case where the input command.script does not contain any arguments.

The bug is likely caused by the split() method being called on a script that does not contain any arguments, resulting in an empty list and triggering an IndexError when trying to access the second element in the list.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command.script contains at least one element before attempting to access the second element. We also need to ensure that the 'usage:' is present in the command.stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the command.script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element to compare it with 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring. Then, it proceeds to check for 'usage:' in the command.stderr as expected.
