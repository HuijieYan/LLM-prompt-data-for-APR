The issue with the current implementation is that it assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by space, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element. To fix this bug, we need to update the implementation to check the length of the `command.script.split()` before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the length of the split `command.script` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError` that was occurring. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub report and ensures that the function behaves correctly for the provided input values and types.
