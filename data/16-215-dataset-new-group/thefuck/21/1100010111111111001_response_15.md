The bug in the function `match` is likely caused by the incorrect use of `split()` without checking if there are enough words in the command.script. This is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has enough elements before trying to access the second one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the split list `script_parts` has more than one element, and then accesses the second element to compare it with `'stash'`. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and fix the bug.
