The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command matches the git stash error message. The function is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is not handling cases where the command does not have a second word and is resulting in a `IndexError` when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `match` function to first check if the command has more than one word before trying to access the second word. If the command does not have more than one word, we should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the command script by spaces
    command_split = command.script.split()
    
    if len(command_split) > 1:  # Check if the command has more than one word
        return (command_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the command has more than one word, and only then proceed to check if the second word is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and not throw an `IndexError`.
