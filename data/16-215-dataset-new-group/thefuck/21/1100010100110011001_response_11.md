### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match a git command that includes 'stash' and has an error message containing 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is throwing an IndexError because it is trying to split the command script by spaces and accessing the element at index 1 without checking if it exists.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function attempts to access the second element of the split command script without ensuring that it exists. This causes an IndexError when the split command script does not have enough elements.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function should first check if the split command script has enough elements before accessing the second element.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
