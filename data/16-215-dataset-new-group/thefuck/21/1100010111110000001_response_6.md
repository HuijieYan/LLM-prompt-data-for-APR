The bug in the `match` function is due to the use of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split command actually generates two or more words. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command generates at least two elements before accessing the second element of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the command script into words
    words = command.script.split()
    
    # Check if the split command generates at least two words, and if the second word is 'stash'
    return (len(words) >= 2 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the `match` function will first check if the split command generates at least two words before trying to access the second word. This will prevent the `IndexError` that was previously occurring.
