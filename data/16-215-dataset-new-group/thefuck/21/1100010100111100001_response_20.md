The buggy function is supposed to match git commands related to stash, but it fails to do so and raises an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element of the `split()` result without checking if it exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes there will always be at least two elements in the split result of the command script. When the script doesn't contain a second element, it raises an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the function will first check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
