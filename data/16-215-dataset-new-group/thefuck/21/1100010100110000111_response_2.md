The buggy function is causing an IndexError due to attempting to access the second element of the split command if the script is 'git' and not 'git stash'. This is identified as the cause of the bug both in the error message and the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check whether the script is 'git' only, and return False in such cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function will handle the case when the script is 'git' and not 'git stash' by returning False, which resolves the IndexError issue.
