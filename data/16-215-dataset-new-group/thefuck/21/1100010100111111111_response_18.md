The buggy function is the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function is designed to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at the line where the script is split.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the command script will always contain at least two words, and tries to access the second word without checking for its existence. This causes an IndexError when the command script contains only one word.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the command script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. If there is only one word, it should return False. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) >= 2:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
``` 

This modification ensures that the function does not try to access the second word of the command script if it doesn't exist, thus addressing the IndexError issue.
