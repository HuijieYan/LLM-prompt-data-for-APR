### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match a command for git stash with an error message. However, the implementation currently uses the split() method without checking if the script parameter itself exists, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split result.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split result without checking if it exists, leading to an IndexError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to first check if the command script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If it doesn't, there is no match and the function should return False. Additionally, the function should also check for the presence of the word 'stash' in the command script to ensure it's a git stash command before further processing.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split() if command.script else []
    return (
        len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```
