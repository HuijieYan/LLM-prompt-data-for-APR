The buggy function is designed to check if the second word in the input command is "stash", and if the stderr of the command contains the word "usage:". The bug is that the function does not handle cases where the input command has fewer than 2 words. 

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the input command has at least two words before trying to access the second word. Additionally, we should check if the word "stash" is present in the first word of the input command, and also if "usage:" is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

This fixed version checks if the input command has at least two words, and then checks if the second word is "stash" and if "usage:" is present in the stderr. If all conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.
