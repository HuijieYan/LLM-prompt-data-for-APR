The issue is that the `match` function is failing when the `command.script` is just `'git'`. The function is trying to split the script by spaces and access the second element of the resulting list, which causes an `IndexError` because there is only one element in the list.

The fix for this issue is to first check if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second element.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
