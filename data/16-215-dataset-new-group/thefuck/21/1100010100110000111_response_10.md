## Analysis
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` and check if the second split element is 'stash'. However, the error message indicates an IndexError, which means that `split()` is being called on an empty string, causing 'list index out of range' error.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused when the `command.script` is just 'git' (as in the actual error message), resulting in an empty list after splitting and leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy
We need to check if the `command.script` is 'git stash' rather than trying to split it and access the second element directly. Also, we should consider checking the first element of the split list to ensure that index out of range does not occur.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
