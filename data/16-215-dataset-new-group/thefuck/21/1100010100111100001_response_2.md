The buggy function is trying to split the command script and check if the second element is 'stash', but it doesn't handle cases where the script might not have a second element. This is causing an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split script.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version first checks if the script has more than one element before accessing the second element. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring and make the function pass the failing test.
