The buggy function fails because it tries to split `command.script` and access the second element without checking if there are any elements to split in the first place. This causes an `IndexError: list index out of range` when `command.script` is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements to split before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that we only access the second element of the split `command.script` if there are enough elements to split.

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the function should no longer cause an `IndexError`. This will resolve the issue posted in GitHub as well.
