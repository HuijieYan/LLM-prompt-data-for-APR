## A corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Explanation:
The buggy function was failing because it was assuming that the `command.script` always has at least two elements, but in the failing case, the `command.script` was just "git", causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element. 

To fix this, we need to first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before checking the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

The corrected version of the function includes this check, ensuring that the function will not throw an `IndexError` when accessing the second element of `command.script.split()`.
