### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is intended to determine if the command is a git stash command based on the input parameter `command`, which represents the command being executed, and the presence of the string 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`. However, the bug is in the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, which assumes that the second word in the script of the command is always 'stash'.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` may not accurately determine if the command is a git stash command. If the script doesn't split into at least 2 words, an index out of range error will occur. Additionally, it's possible for the second word to be something other than 'stash' even if it is a git stash command, in which case the function would return False even though it is a git stash command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command represents a git stash command based on the presence of 'stash' in the command.script and confirm that 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
