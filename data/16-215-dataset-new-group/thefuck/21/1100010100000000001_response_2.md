## Analysis of the buggy function

The buggy function is designed to match a specific Git command and an error message in order to trigger a correction. However, the current implementation has a potential error location where it directly accesses the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. This can cause an "IndexError" if the command script does not contain any elements after splitting.

## Identified potential error location
The potential error location is in the line:
```python
command.script.split()[1]
```

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function does not check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This can lead to an "IndexError" if the command script is empty or does not have enough elements after splitting.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split command script before trying to access the second element. If the length is sufficient, then we can proceed with the comparison.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first split the command script and store the result in a variable. Then, we check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This fix ensures that we avoid potential "IndexError" by checking the length of the split script before accessing its elements.
