The buggy function `match` is designed to check whether a Git command is related to stashing changes. It does this by splitting the command script and checking if the second word is 'stash', and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. However, the error message indicates an 'IndexError,' indicating that the list index is out of range.

The cause of the bug is the assumption that the command script will always contain at least two words. This assumption leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second word of the command script, leading to the failure of the function.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the command contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word. Additionally, we should verify that the stderr is not empty before checking for the presence of 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the command has at least two words in the script and stderr is not empty
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1 and command.stderr:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With these changes, the corrected function will no longer encounter an IndexError and should pass the failing test.
