## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is trying to match a command with the word 'stash' and check if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The error message indicates an "IndexError" which means that the buggy function is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location in the buggy function could be the `command.script.split()[1]` because it's trying to access the second element of the split command, which might not exist.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the split command does not necessarily contain two elements. If the split command only contains one element, then trying to access the second element will result in an IndexError.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The buggy function needs to be modified to check if the split command contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This can be done by checking the length of the split command.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the split command contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError that was occurring in the buggy function.
