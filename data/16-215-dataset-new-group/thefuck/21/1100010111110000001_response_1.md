The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the `git` command includes the word "stash" and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". The buggy function has an error that causes an `IndexError` when splitting the `command.script` attribute.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function assumes there will be at least two words in `command.script`, and tries to access index 1 without checking if the split actually produced two or more words.

To fix the bug, the function should first split the `command.script` and then check if it contains the word "stash". It should also check if the `stderr` contains the word "usage:". If the `command.script` does not contain at least two words, then it does not represent a valid git command, and we should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) < 2:
        return False
    git_command = parts[1]
    return (git_command == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
