The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an IndexError, which means that the command.script.split()[1] is causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the original implementation assumes that the command.script contains at least two words, and it doesn't handle cases where the split results in fewer than two words.

To fix the bug, we need to first check whether the split result has at least two words before accessing the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
