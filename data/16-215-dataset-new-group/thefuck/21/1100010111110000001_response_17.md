The problem with the buggy function is that it is trying to split the command script and access the second element without checking if there are enough elements after splitting. This is causing an IndexError when the script has no second element. 

To fix the bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements in the split script before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we split the command script and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if there are more than 1 element in the `script_parts`, and only then access the second element to compare with 'stash'. This way, we avoid the IndexError that was happening in the buggy version.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
