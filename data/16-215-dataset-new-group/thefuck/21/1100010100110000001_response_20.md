The buggy function `match` is trying to split the command script and check if the second part is 'stash', then it checks if the word 'usage:' is in the command stderr. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError: list index out of range` in `thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py` on line 8, which suggests that the `command.script.split()` may not be returning enough elements to be indexed.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the command script contains more than one element before trying to access the second element. We can also confirm if the second element is 'stash' before checking for 'usage:' in the command stderr. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix checks if the split command script has more than one part, then proceeds to check if the second part is 'stash' and finally checks for 'usage:' in the command stderr. This corrected version should resolve the `IndexError` and pass the failing test.
