There are several issues with the current implementation of the `match` function:

1. The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash', which is incorrect.

2. The condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr` is checking if the string 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr, which is partially correct but might not cover all cases.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `split` function to determine if the command is related to `git stash`, and an incomplete check for the 'usage:' string in the stderr.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command starts with 'git stash' and also check for the complete string 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```
