The buggy function is attempting to split the command's script attribute and check if the second element is 'stash', while also checking if the command's stderr attribute contains 'usage:'. The error message indicates an IndexError, specifically stating that the list index is out of range.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes there will be at least two elements in the split command.script, which is not always the case.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command.script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split command.script before accessing the second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
