### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to match the `git stash` command, but it fails when the `git` command is used alone, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to split the command script. This bug was reported in the GitHub issue, and the error message also provides insights into the cause.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely occurring at the line `command.script.split()[1]` where it tries to access the second element of the split command. When `command.script` is just `"git"`, this will result in an `IndexError` as reported.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always have at least two elements when using `split()`, which is not the case when the input is just `"git"`.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should first check the length of the split command array before accessing its elements to avoid an `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected function starts by splitting the command script and then checks if the length of the split array is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter an `IndexError` when the command script is just `"git"`.
