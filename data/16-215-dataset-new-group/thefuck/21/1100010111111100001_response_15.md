The buggy function `match` is supposed to match a command to check if it's a specific git command, but it's failing with an `IndexError` due to `list index out of range` when attempting to split the command script.

The issue lies in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where it's trying to access the second element of the split command script, but it assumes that the script contains at least two elements, which is not always the case.

To fix this bug, we can check if the split command script has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
