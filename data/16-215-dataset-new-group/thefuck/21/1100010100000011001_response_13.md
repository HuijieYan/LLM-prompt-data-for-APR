### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to check if a Git command is `stash` and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr without verifying the command.

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error is in the conditional statement where it checks for both the command and the 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check. The function only checks for 'usage:' in the stderr without validating the command.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should validate both the command and the stderr. Additionally, it should specifically check for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts[0] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
