## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By changing the index from [1] to [0] in the comparison `command.script.split()[0]`, we can match the 'git' command at the start of the script. This will ensure that the correct condition is met for the function to return `True` when the stderr message contains 'usage:'.
