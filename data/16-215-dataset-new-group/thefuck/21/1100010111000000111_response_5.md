The buggy function is `match` and it is failing to identify whether the command is a git stash command based on the error message in the command. The buggy function doesn't handle the case when `git` command is executed without any arguments or subcommands.

The cause of the bug is that the `match` function is trying to access the second element of the split command script even if it doesn't exist, which leads to the `IndexError` when the command is just `git`.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, it should return `False`.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the `match` function will first check if the split command has at least two elements, and only then it will try to access the second element to check if it's a git stash command. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the command is just `git`.

After applying this fix, the `match` function should work correctly and pass the failing test, resolving the GitHub issue.
