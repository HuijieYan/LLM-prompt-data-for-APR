The buggy function is `match` and it is supposed to determine if the given command is related to the git stash command based on the stderr of the command.

The error is occurring due to the `command.script.split()[1]` expression when the script is just `git`. In this case, the split function will result in an empty list, causing the "list index out of range" error when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the command has at least two parts before trying to access index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script and store it in the `parts` variable. Then, we check if the length of `parts` is greater than 1 before accessing index 1. This prevents the "list index out of range" error.
