The issue with the provided buggy function is that it is attempting to access the second element of `command.script.split()`, which would cause an "IndexError" if the split result does not have at least two elements. If the command is just "git" and there are no other arguments, the split result would only have one element, causing the function to fail.

To fix this issue, we should first check if the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. We can also check if the first element is "git" and if the error message contains the string "git stash" to ensure we are matching the correct scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```
