The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the input command is related to the git stash operation and if the usage message is found in the error output. However, the function fails when the input command is simply 'git' without any additional arguments provided, leading to a list index out of range error.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the command includes the keyword 'stash', and then proceed to check for the usage message in the error output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and 'stash' in command.script:
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will first verify if the input command includes the keyword 'stash', only then checking for the presence of the usage message. This approach ensures that the function can handle the case where the input command is simply 'git' without additional arguments.

After applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
