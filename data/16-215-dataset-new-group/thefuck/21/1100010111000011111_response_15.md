The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script mentions 'stash' and if the stderr includes 'usage:'. However, there is a bug in the function which causes it to throw an `IndexError` when the command script does not contain the expected elements.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the command script will always have at least one element after splitting, leading to the `IndexError` when the assumption is not met.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case where the split command script does not contain the expected elements. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure the command script has enough elements before attempting to access any element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the split command script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This ensures that the function does not encounter an IndexError when trying to access the 'stash' element.
