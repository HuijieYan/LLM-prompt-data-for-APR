The buggy function `match` is supposed to determine whether the given command is a git stash command with an incorrect usage message in the stderr. However, the function is failing with an `IndexError` due to a split operation on `command.script` without checking for its length.

The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by whitespace. In the failing case, the `command.script` only contains one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the `command.script` before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function will first split the `command.script` and then check the length of the resulting list before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and resolve the bug.
