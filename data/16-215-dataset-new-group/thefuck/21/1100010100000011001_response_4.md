### Analysis
The `match` function is intended to check if the command is a git stash command that resulted in an error. However, the current implementation does not adequately check for the presence of the `usage:` in the error message. Additionally, it doesn't check if the command actually succeeded or failed.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it only checks for the presence of `stash` in the command and `usage:` in the error message. It doesn't consider the success or failure of the command.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should check if the command is a git stash command, and if the command failed (indicating that the stash did not succeed). Then, it should check if the error message contains `usage:`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (parts[0] == 'git' and parts[1] == 'stash' and command.returncode != 0 and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
