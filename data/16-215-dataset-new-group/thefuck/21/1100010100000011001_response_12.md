### Analysis
The buggy function is using the split() function on command.script without checking if the split actually returns at least two elements, which can cause an "index out of range" error. It also checks for the presence of 'usage:' in command.stderr, but it should actually be checking for its absence.

### Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that command.script will always contain at least two elements, and by checking for the presence of 'usage:' in command.stderr instead of its absence.

### Fix
The function should first check if the split() on command.script returns at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. It should also be checking for the absence of 'usage:' in command.stderr instead.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' not in command.stderr)
```
