The buggy function `match` is supposed to identify if the git command is related to stash and if the command execution resulted in an error. However, there are several potential error locations in the function.

The potential error locations are as follows:
1. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` might fail if the command is not well-formed or if there are extra spaces.
2. The check for `'usage:' in command.stderr` might be problematic if the error message format varies.

The cause of the bug is that the function `match` is not robust enough to handle variations in the command or error message format.

To fix the bug, we need to make the function more robust by using more reliable methods to detect if the command is related to stash and if there is an error. One way to do this is to use regular expressions to search for the stash command and check the error message for a pattern indicating an error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    stash_pattern = re.compile(r'\bgit\s+stash\b')
    error_pattern = re.compile(r'\busage:\b')

    if stash_pattern.search(command.script) is not None and error_pattern.search(command.stderr) is not None:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should be able to handle variations in the command and error message format, and also pass the failing test provided.
