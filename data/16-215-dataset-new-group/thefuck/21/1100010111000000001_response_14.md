The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, it does so by splitting the command script on spaces and checking the second word. This can lead to an Index error if the command script does not have enough words.

The buggy function is assuming that the second word will always be 'stash', which may not be the case. Also, it does not check if the command is actually related to git stash.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command is a git command and if it is related to git stash. Then, we can check if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        parts[0] == 'git' and 
        'stash' in parts and 
        'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the command is a git command and if it is related to git stash. Then it will verify if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. This should address the issues with the original buggy function and make it pass the failing test.
