The issue is occurring because the `split()` method is being called on `command.script` without checking if it has any elements. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the resulting list.

To fix this issue, we can add a check to ensure that the script has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Now, the function first splits the `command.script` and then checks if it has at least 2 elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
