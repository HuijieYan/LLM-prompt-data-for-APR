The buggy function is supposed to check if the git command is related to 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is causing an IndexError because it attempts to split the command.script without checking if it contains any elements.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes that the command.script can always be split into multiple elements, which is not the case when the command.script is just 'git'.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split command.script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version will first split the command.script and then check if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.
