The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a git command is related to stashing changes in a git repository. However, the current implementation only checks whether the second part of the input command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This approach is flawed and does not account for varying command inputs and error messages that could occur in different scenarios.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The function only checks for the second part of the script split and assumes it is always 'stash'.
2. It only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr and does not consider other possible error messages that may occur.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not accurately identify commands related to stashing changes and may produce false negatives. To fix the bug, the function should check for a wider range of possible commands related to stashing changes and consider different error messages that may indicate a command's relevance to stashing.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for a broader range of commands related to stashing changes, and consider other error messages that may indicate relevance to stashing. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    relevant_commands = ['stash', 'unstash', 'pop', 'apply', 'drop']  # Relevant commands for stashing changes
    if script_parts[1] in relevant_commands and 'stash' in script_parts[1]:  # Check for relevant commands
        return True
    elif 'usage:' in command.stderr:  # Check for 'usage:' in the error message
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, the function will accurately identify commands related to stashing changes and consider a broader range of potential relevant commands and error messages. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
