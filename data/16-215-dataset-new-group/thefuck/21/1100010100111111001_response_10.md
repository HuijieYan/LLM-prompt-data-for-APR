The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command script is related to a git command (`git` is the first word in the script) and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. 

The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is being raised when trying to access the second element of the split script, suggesting that the script may not contain any whitespace-separated elements. 

The runtime input values show that the command script is simply 'git', and it does not contain any additional whitespace-separated elements. This causes the split to result in a list with only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element as `split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check if the `git` command is present and if 'stash' is present in the script.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('git' in script_words and 'stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
