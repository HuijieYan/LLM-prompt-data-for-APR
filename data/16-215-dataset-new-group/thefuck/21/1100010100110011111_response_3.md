### Analysis
The `git_fix_stash` rule is failing because it is expecting the command script to contain the word "stash" at index 1 in the split command but is not handling the case when the command script is just "git", which results in an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

### Error Location
The error is occurring in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming the command script contains the word "stash" at index 1 without validating the length of the split list. This results in an IndexError when the script contains only "git".

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should first validate the length of the split list before accessing index 1. If the list is too short, we should return False. Additionally, we should also check if the first split element is equal to "stash", which is the desired behavior. 

### Updated Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_cmd = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_cmd) > 1 and split_cmd[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
