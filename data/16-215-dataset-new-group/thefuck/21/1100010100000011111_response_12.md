## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the given git command is related to stashing and if there's an error in the command's output. The bug seems to be originating from the assumption that `command.script` contains the entire git command when in reality, it might not always be the case.

## Potential Error Location
The issue arises from the statement `command.script.split()[1]`, which attempts to split the command and access the second element. If the command is just "git" without any arguments, this statement will throw an `IndexError` because there won't be a second element to access.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always contain a valid git command with multiple elements. However, in the failing test case, the command is simply "git", and the function attempts to access the second element of the split command, causing the IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we should first check if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second one. We should also include additional checks to ensure that the command is related to stashing and that there's an error in the output.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
