The buggy function is intended to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the string "usage:". The buggy function is failing because it's trying to split the script by spaces and then access the second element without checking if it exists.

The `command.script.split()[1]` raises an IndexError when there is no second element in the split list.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the script contains the word "stash", and then check if the "usage:" string exists in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
