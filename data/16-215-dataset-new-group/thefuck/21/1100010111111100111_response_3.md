The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `'git'`. The `match` function, which checks if the `stderr` of the given command contains the word `'usage'`, assumes that the `command.script` contains at least two words. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when `split()[1]` is called on a single-word script like `'git'` causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to handle the case where the `command.script` has only one word ('git') differently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and then check if the number of words is more than one. If yes, we carry out the original check for 'stash' and 'usage:', otherwise, we return False to indicate that it doesn't match the condition.

With this correction, the function will now handle the case where `command.script` has only one word and will not result in an `IndexError`. This fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
