The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the input command is a git stash command and if the error message contains the word "usage:". However, the buggy implementation is causing an `IndexError` because the script is split into a list but the 1st index is accessed without verifying if it exists.

The function can be fixed by checking the length of the split command before accessing the 1st index. Here's the corrected version:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the split command has at least two parts before trying to access the 1st index.
