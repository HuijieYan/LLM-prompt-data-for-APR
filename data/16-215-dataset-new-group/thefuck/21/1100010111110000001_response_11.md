The problem with the buggy `match` function is that it directly assumes that `command.script.split()[1]` will always exist. However, in the failing test, the `command` object is not providing the expected input, leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that `command.script` contains more than one element before accessing the second element with index `[1]`.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`, then we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element. This modification should fix the `IndexError` and the function should now pass the failing test.
