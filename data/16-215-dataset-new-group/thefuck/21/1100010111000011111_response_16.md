The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is 'git stash' and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. The failing test case `test_not_match` is testing the behavior when the stderr is set to the value of `git_stash_err` and the command is 'git'.

The bug in the function is that it assumes the existence of the second element after splitting `command.script`, which is not the case when the command is just 'git' with no arguments.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 to ensure that we are accessing a valid element. Additionally, the condition for 'stash' and 'usage:' in stderr should be joined with an 'and' operator to enforce both conditions.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_tokens = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_tokens) > 1
            and script_tokens[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
