The buggy function `match` is supposed to determine whether the command corresponds to the `git stash` invocation and the stderr includes the string `'usage:'`. However, it has a bug that causes it to raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script if the script contains only the command 'git'.

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle the corner case of an insufficient number of elements after splitting the command script.

To fix the bug, we can check if the split command has more than one element before trying to access the second one, and also check for the presence of the string `'usage:'` in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted on GitHub by handling the corner case of an insufficient number of elements after splitting the command script.
