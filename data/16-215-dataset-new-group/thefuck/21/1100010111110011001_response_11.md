The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the `git` command is a `stash` command and if the `stderr` contains the string 'usage:'. However, it has a bug that causes an IndexError when splitting the `command.script`.

The cause of the bug is that the function `match` does not handle cases where the `command.script` does not have enough elements to split.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `command.script` contains enough elements before accessing the second element, and then perform the required checks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if there are enough elements in `command.script` before attempting to access the second element. This avoids the IndexError that was occurring in the buggy version.
