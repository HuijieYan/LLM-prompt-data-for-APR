The buggy function `match` is intended to match a command that contains 'git stash' and has an error message containing 'usage:'. It then checks if the second word in the command is 'stash'. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the command has only one word, 'git', causing an `IndexError` when attempting to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

Potential error locations:
- `command.script.split()[1]`: This line is causing the `IndexError` when `script` has only one word.
- The conditional statement may need to be updated to handle the case of a single-word script.

The cause of the bug:
The failing test provides a command with a single word, `'git'`, and an error message containing 'usage:'. When the function `match` is executed with these values, an `IndexError` occurs because the split command only results in one element.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Add a check to handle the case where the script has only one word, and update the conditional statement to properly check for the presence of 'stash' in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words`, we ensure that it has at least two words before attempting to access the second word. This correction should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function pass the failing test.
