### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is intended to check whether the command is for the git stash and if there is an error message in the output. However, there is a bug in the function that causes it to fail the test.

### Bug
The bug in the `match` function is that it only checks for the presence of the word "stash" in the command script and the presence of "usage:" in the command stderr. It does not consider the actual command "git" and it does not check that the stderr is for the stash command.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to validate the whole command, check that the stderr is for the stash command, and also check that the error message is related to the usage of the stash command.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script[0] == 'git' 
            and command.script[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
