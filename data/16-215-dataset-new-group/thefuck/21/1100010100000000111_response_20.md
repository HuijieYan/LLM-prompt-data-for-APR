The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script starts with `git stash` and if the command stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is not handling cases where the script is just `git`, which results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split script.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function doesn't check the length of the split script and directly accesses the second element without validating its existence. This causes an `IndexError` when the length is less than 2.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the function to first check the length of the split script before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, we can directly return False.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
