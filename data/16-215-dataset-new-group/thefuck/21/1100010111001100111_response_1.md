The problem with the buggy function is that it is attempting to split the command script and access its second element without checking if the script has at least two elements. The buggy function is designed to return true if the script is 'git stash' but the usage message is found in the stderr. However, it is failing to handle the case where the script is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check if the script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the script into individual words. Then we check if there are at least two elements in the split_script list before attempting to access the second element. If there are at least two elements, then we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the command's stderr.

This corrected version should now handle the case where the script is just 'git' and pass the failing test. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
