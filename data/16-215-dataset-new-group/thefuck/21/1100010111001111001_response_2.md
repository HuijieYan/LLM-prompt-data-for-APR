The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script starts with 'git' and the standard error contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the function is not correctly checking the input parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is only checking if the first word in the command script is 'stash' instead of checking the full command script. Additionally, it is looking for the exact phrase 'usage:' in the standard error instead of checking for the presence of that phrase.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the entire script starts with 'git stash' and if the standard error contains the phrase 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
