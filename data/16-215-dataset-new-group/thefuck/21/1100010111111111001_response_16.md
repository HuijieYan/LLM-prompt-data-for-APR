The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command and contains the word "usage:" in the stderr. However, the buggy function is trying to split the script and check the second part without handling the case where the script has only one element.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the script will always contain at least two words, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split script.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two words before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
