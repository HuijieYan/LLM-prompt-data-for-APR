## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The statement `command.script.split()[1]` can throw an `IndexError` if `command.script` does not contain at least 2 elements when split by whitespace.
2. The condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr` may not accurately determine if the stderr contains the expected usage prompt due to extra spaces, line breaks, or other formatting issues.

## Cause of the bug
The bug in the `match` function is causing an `IndexError` due to an out-of-range list index access when splitting `command.script`. Additionally, the condition to check for the string 'usage:' in `command.stderr` may not accurately indicate if the stderr contains the expected usage prompt.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, ensure that the `command.script` is split and then check if the resulting elements match the expected values. Also, a more robust check should be implemented for the presence of the usage prompt in `command.stderr` to handle potential formatting discrepancies.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return any('usage:' in line for line in command.stderr.splitlines())
    return False
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `command.script` is split into parts, and it is checked if the split contains at least 2 parts and the second part is 'stash'.
2. The `command.stderr` is split into lines, and a check is performed for the presence of 'usage:' in any of the lines.

This corrected version handles potential index out of range errors and provides a more robust check for the presence of the usage prompt.
