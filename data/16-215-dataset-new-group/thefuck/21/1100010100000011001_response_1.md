### Analysis
The `match` function takes a `command` object as a parameter and checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains the string 'usage:'. If both conditions are met, the function returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

### Identifying the Bug
The bug in the current function is that it does not handle scenario when the `command.script` does not have a second index, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` always has at least two words.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If it does not, the function should return False.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
