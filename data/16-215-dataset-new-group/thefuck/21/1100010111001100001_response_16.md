The buggy function `match` is supposed to match a command with the string 'stash' and check if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is not properly checking for the 'stash' command and is not handling the stderr correctly, leading to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function is only checking if the second part of the split script is 'stash', but it should be checking the first part. Additionally, the condition for checking if 'usage:' is in the stderr is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the 'stash' command and properly check the stderr for the 'usage:' string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git' and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the updated match function will correctly check for the 'git' command and 'stash' command, as well as properly handle the stderr to check for the 'usage:' string. This should make the failing test pass.
