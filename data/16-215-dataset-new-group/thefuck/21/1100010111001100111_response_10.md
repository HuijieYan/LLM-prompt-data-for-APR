The buggy function is supposed to match the git command that fails with an error message about incorrect usage. In the failing test, the `command` parameter does not match the script 'git' and the stderr contains the error message concerning stash usage. But the function is incorrectly checking the second element of the split script.

The bug is caused by the function assuming that the second element of the split script will be 'stash', and it's trying to access it without checking the length of the split script.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the split script has at least two elements before accessing the second element to prevent the IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the split script has at least two elements, and then it compares the second element to 'stash'. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
