The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is caused by the assumption that the `git` command has at least two parts when split by spaces. In this case, the script only contains a single part, 'git', leading to an IndexError when attempting to access the second part.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access the second part. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the rule functions correctly when the command script is just 'git'.
