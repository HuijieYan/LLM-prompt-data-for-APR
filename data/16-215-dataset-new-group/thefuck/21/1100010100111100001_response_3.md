The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` and access the second element, which causes an `IndexError` when the split result does not contain a second element.

The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements after splitting, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# This is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the split result contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and the function should now pass the failing test.
