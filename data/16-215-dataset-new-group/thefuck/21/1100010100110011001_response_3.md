### Explanation
The buggy function is attempting to access the second element of the split command, but it is failing with an IndexError. This is likely due to the split command not returning enough elements, causing the index to be out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command returns enough elements before accessing the second element.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
