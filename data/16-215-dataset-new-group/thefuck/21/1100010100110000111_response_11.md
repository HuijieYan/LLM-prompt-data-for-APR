## Analysis
The error message indicates an `IndexError: list index out of range` and the failing test is for the case when the `command.script` is just "git" and `command.stderr` contains the git usage help message.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely to be in the `match` function where it checks the `command.script.split()[1]` to match 'stash'.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function assumes that the `command.script` will have at least two words after splitting by space, which leads to the `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just "git".
The error is related to the failing of the `git_fix_stash` rule when the `command.script` is just "git", and `command.stderr` contains the git usage message. The `IndexError` occurs because the `command.script.split()[1]` is not available in this context.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The function should be modified to first check if the length of the split command is appropriate before accessing the second element. Additionally, we should also check for the precise error condition which is when the `command.script` is just "git" and `command.stderr` contains the git usage help message.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git ')
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, the `startswith` method is used to check if the `command.script` starts with 'git ', and then the subsequent conditions are checked to ensure that the bug is fixed and the failing test passes.
