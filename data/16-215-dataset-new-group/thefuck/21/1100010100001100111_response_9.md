The issue with the provided buggy function is that it is checking for the presence of the word "stash" in the input command script without first verifying the length of the split script. This causes an IndexError when the script is just "git" and there is no command specified after it.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing its elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the command script and store it in the variable `split_script`. Then we check if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 before accessing the element at index 1 to avoid the IndexError. If the length is greater than 1 and the second element is "stash", and 'usage:' is in the command's stderr, the function returns True as intended.
