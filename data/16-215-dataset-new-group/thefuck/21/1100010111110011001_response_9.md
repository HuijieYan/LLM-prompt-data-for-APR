### Bug Fix Strategy
The buggy function is trying to split the script attribute of the command object and access the second element, assuming it exists, without checking if it exists. This is causing an IndexError when the script attribute doesn't have the expected structure. To fix this, the function should first check if the script attribute contains the expected elements before proceeding.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and
            script_parts[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
