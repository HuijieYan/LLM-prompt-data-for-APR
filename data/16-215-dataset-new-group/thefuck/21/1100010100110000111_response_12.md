The buggy function `match` is supposed to return True if the command is related to `git stash`, but it is throwing an `IndexError` when the command is just `git`. This is because the function is trying to access the second item in the list resulted from splitting the command script, which might not exist in case of a single-word command.

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the command has at least two words before attempting to access the second element of the split script. We can also check if the first word of the command is `git`. If so, we can then check if the second word is `stash`. In any other case, we should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    if len(words) > 1 and words[0] == 'git':
        return words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

This modification will ensure that the function does not throw an `IndexError` when the command is just `git`, and it will also check for the presence of the word `stash` in the command script before proceeding to analyze the stderr. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
