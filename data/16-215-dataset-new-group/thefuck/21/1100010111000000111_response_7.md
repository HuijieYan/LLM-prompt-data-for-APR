The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command involves git stash and whether the usage information is present in the stderr. However, the bug is causing it to fail when the script is just "git" without any additional arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the command does not contain any additional arguments after "git". This leads to an IndexError when trying to access index 1 of the split command script.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command script has enough elements before trying to access index 1. If not, then the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing index 1, the corrected function will avoid the IndexError when the script is just "git" without any additional arguments. This fix will ensure that the function passes the failing test and resolves the GitHub issue.
