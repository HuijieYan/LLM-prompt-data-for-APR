The buggy function is `match` and it is designed to check if the git command is related to stashing by checking the command script and stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` is expecting the match function to return False when the command script is 'git' and stderr contains the usage information for git stash.

The error is caused by an `IndexError`, which means that the `command.script.split()` is not returning a list with at least two elements, and the buggy function is trying to access the second element which does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` is split into a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` and checking if the resulting list has more than one element before accessing the second element, we can prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function works as expected.
