command.script = 'git stash'
command = Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err)
command.stderr = '''
usage: git stash list [<options>]
   or: git stash show [<stash>]
   or: git stas... [-k|--[no-]keep-index] [-q|--quiet]
		       [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [<message>]]
   or: git stash clear
'''

The buggy function is intended to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is failing with an IndexError because it is trying to split the command.script without checking if it contains more than one word.

A strategy to fix this bug is to first check if the command contains the 'stash' keyword and then split the command to check for 'usage:'. This can prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version checks if the command contains more than one word before attempting to access the second word. If the command does not contain more than one word, it returns False. If it does, it checks for the 'stash' keyword and the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.
