The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by space, which is not the case when the script is just 'git'. This results in an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element. If there are less than two elements, then the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the split script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and the function will return False if there are not enough elements.
