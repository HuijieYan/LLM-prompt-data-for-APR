The buggy function `match()` is intended to check if the user's input is a git command related to `stash` and whether the `usage:` error message is present in the command's standard error. However, the buggy implementation simply checks if the second word in the input command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the error message. This implementation does not account for commands where `git` is directly entered without any subcommand.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
- When the user input is just `git`, the function tries to access the second word in the command, resulting in a `list index out of range` error and causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the input command is simply `git` and handle that case separately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1. If it is, we proceed with the original logic to check for 'stash' and 'usage:'. If the length is 1, we return `False` to handle the case where the command is just `git`. This fix ensures that the function does not fail when the command is just `git`.
