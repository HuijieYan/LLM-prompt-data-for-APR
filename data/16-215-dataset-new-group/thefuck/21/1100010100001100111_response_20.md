## Bug Explanation
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` string and check if the second element is equal to 'stash', but it does not handle the case where `command.script` has only one element.

## Fix Strategy
We need to first check if the length of the split `command.script` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
