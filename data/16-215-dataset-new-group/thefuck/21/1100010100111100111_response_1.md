The error message and failing test indicate that the buggy function is failing due to an IndexError, specifically "list index out of range". This likely occurs because the buggy function is attempting to access the second item in the split command, which doesn't exist when the command is just "git".

To fix this bug, add a check in the buggy function to ensure that the split command has at least two items before accessing the second item.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Adding a check to ensure that the split_command has at least two items before accessing the second item will prevent the IndexError from occurring. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
