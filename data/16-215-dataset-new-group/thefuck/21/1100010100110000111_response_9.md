### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location is at the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
```
This line split the command script by space and tries to access the second element, which might cause an IndexError if the script contains only 'git' and no other arguments.


### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of the split command, which results in an IndexError if the script does not contain additional arguments after 'git'.


### Strategy for fixing the bug
A potential fix for the bug would be to first check if there are enough elements in the split command before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we can check if the first element of the split command is 'git' before proceeding with the comparison.


### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[0] == 'git' 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, we first split the command script and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check whether `script_parts` has more than one element, whether the first element is 'git', and whether the second element is 'stash'. After that, we check if 'usage:' is in the stderr to make sure that the command is related to 'git stash'.
