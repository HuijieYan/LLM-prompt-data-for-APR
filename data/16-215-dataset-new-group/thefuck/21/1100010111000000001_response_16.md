## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to match git commands with errors related to using the `stash` command. It checks if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the error message contains "usage:". However, the test function `test_not_match` is expecting the function to not match a specific git command with the error message `git_stash_err`.

## Potential Error Locations
The error could be in the condition used to check if the command script contains "stash" and if the error message contains "usage:".

## Cause of the Bug
The bug may occur because the condition in the `match` function is not accurately determining whether the command matches the criteria for fixing the stash error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `match` function to accurately check if a command matches the criteria for fixing the stash error.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, I have replaced `command.script.split()[1]` with `command.script_parts[1]` to accurately access the second part of the command script. This will ensure that the function can accurately match the command with the stash error, and the corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
