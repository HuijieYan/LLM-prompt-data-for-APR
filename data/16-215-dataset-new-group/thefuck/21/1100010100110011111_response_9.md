## Analysis
The current function attempts to split the `command.script` and check if the second element is equal to "stash". However, the error message indicates that the "list index is out of range", suggesting that the `command.script` does not contain at least two elements to split.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when splitting. In this case, the `command.script` only contains 'git', leading to the index error.

## Fix Strategy
We need to add a check to ensure that there are enough elements in the `command.script` before attempting to access the second element.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and check if there are enough parts before accessing the second element. If the split results in enough parts, we then proceed to compare the second part with 'stash' and check for 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`.
