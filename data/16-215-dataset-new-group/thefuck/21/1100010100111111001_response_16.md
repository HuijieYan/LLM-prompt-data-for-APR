The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` on whitespace and then access the second element in the resulting list without checking if it exists. This is causing an `IndexError` when the resulting list has less than 2 elements.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the split result has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
