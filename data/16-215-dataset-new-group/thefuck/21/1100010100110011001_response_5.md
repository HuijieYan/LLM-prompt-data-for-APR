### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` which means that the `command.script` does not contain enough words to access the second index. This is likely because the `command.script` is empty in this case, causing the `IndexError`.

### Bug
The bug is caused when trying to access the second word in `command.script` when it doesn't contain at least two words, resulting in an `IndexError`.

### Fix
We need to first check if `command.script` contains at least two words before accessing the second word.

### The corrected code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    try:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    except IndexError:
        return False
```
