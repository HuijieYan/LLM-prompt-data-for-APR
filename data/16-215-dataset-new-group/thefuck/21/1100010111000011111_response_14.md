The buggy function `match(command)` seems to check if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. However, there is no check for the length of `command.script.split()`, so it can throw an IndexError if there are no words in `command.script`.

The GitHub issue for this bug states that the `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs when running the 'git' command, where it expects the second word to be 'stash' but encounters an empty list, leading to the index error.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to check if the script contains at least the second word before trying to access it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first checks if `len(words) > 1` to ensure that the script contains at least two words before accessing the second word. This change should prevent the IndexError from occurring and address the GitHub issue.
