### Strategy for fixing the bug
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` and then compare the second element to 'stash'. The issue is that the `command.script` might not always contain at least two elements. We should add a check to ensure that the split operation will not cause an `IndexError`.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
