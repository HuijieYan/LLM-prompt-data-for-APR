The bug in the current function is that it does not check if the script has enough arguments before accessing the second item in the split list. This causes an IndexError if the script does not have enough arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least 2 items before comparing the second item to 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has at least 2 items before accessing the second item. This will prevent the IndexError.
