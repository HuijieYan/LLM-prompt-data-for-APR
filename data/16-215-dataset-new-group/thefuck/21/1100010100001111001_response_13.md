The buggy function is designed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the text 'usage:'. However, it is currently checking if the second word in the command.script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the entire command.stderr, which is not an accurate way to determine if the command is a git stash command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly checking the script without considering its structure and is not specifically checking for the presence of the word 'stash' in the script.

To fix the bug, the function should split the script by spaces and check if the first word is 'git' and the second word is 'stash'. It should also check if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr, which would accurately determine if it's a git stash command with the correct usage message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[0] == 'git' 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
