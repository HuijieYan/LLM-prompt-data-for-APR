The bug in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the `match` function is called. 

The cause of the bug is that the `split()` method is being called on an empty string when `command.script` is empty. This causes an IndexError because there is no index 1 in an empty list.

To fix this bug, we can check if `command.script` is not empty before attempting to split it. If it is empty, we can assume that the command does not match and return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if not command.script:
        return False
    else:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function will return False if the `command.script` is empty, avoiding the IndexError that occurred before. This will resolve the bug and make the function work as expected.
