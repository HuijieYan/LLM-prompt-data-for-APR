The buggy function is attempting to access `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split actually resulted in a list with at least two elements. This causes an `IndexError` when the split results in a list with only one element.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the split resulted in a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and 
            split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split resulted in a list with at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring before.
