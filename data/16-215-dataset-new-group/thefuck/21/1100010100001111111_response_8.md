The issue is that the current implementation of the 'match' function for the 'git_fix_stash' rule assumes that the second word in the 'git' command's script is 'stash'. This assumption is not valid and leads to the 'IndexError' when accessing the non-existing 'split()[1]' element.

To fix this bug, we should modify the 'match' function to first check if the command has the word 'git' and then specifically check if the second word is 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git' in command.script.split() and 
            command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will now first check if the command contains the word 'git' before attempting to access the second word. This will avoid the 'IndexError' and ensure that the function correctly matches the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
