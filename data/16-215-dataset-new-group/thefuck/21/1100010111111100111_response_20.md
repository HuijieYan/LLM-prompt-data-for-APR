The buggy function is designed to match when the script contains the word 'stash' and the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. 

The bug occurs because the buggy function assumes that the script will always contain at least two words and attempts to access the second word of the script using `command.script.split()[1]`. However, in the failing test case, the script is just 'git', so the split operation results in a list with only one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word.

To fix this bug, the function should check for the presence of 'stash' in the script and the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, rather than accessing specific elements of the split script directly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
