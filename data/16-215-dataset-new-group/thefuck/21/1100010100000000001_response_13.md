## Analysis
The buggy function checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, this approach is prone to errors because it does not account for variations in the command structure and the content of stderr.

## Error Locations
1. The function does not handle cases where the command structure is different from what is expected.
2. It assumes that the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr is always an indication of an error.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function's reliance on specific command structure and error message content, which may not always be consistent.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should check if the command contains 'stash' and if the stderr indicates an error in a more robust and flexible manner.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_words = command.script.split()
    if 'stash' in command_words and 'error' in command.stderr.lower():
        return True
    return False
```
In the corrected version, we split the command script to get the individual words and then check if 'stash' is one of the words and if the word 'error' is present in the lowercase stderr. This approach allows for more flexibility in identifying the command and error conditions.
