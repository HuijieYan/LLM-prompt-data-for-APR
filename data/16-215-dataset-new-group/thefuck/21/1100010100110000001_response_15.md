The buggy function is attempting to split the command script and compare the second element to 'stash', and checking if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an "IndexError" which is likely happening when trying to access the second element of the split command script, indicating that the split method is not returning enough elements.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has enough elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version ensures that the script has enough elements before accessing the second element, thus preventing the "IndexError" from occurring.
