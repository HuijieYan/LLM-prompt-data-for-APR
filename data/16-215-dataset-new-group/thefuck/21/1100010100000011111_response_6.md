The buggy function is designed to check if the command is a git stash and if the error message contains the word "usage:". The buggy function seems to be throwing an `IndexError` because it is trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without checking if it exists. 

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command contains at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, we first check if the `script_parts` list contains at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and satisfy the expected input/output values while resolving the GitHub issue.
