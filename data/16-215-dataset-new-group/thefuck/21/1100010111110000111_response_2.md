The issue with the buggy function is that it assumes there will always be a second word in the command script, which leads to an IndexError when accessing `command.script.split()[1]` in a scenario where the command only consists of 'git' without any arguments.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to check for both the command being 'stash' and the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. Additionally, we should check if there are actual words in the script command before trying to access the second element after splitting.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) > 1
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

This version checks if the `script_parts` list has more than one element before checking if the second element is 'stash'. It should resolve the index out of range issue and pass the failing test.
