The issue here is that the buggy function is trying to access the second item in the list created by splitting the command script, which might not exist in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script contains the word "stash" before attempting to split it. Then, we can check if "usage:" is present in the command stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if "stash" is present in the command script and then proceed to check if "usage:" is present in the command stderr. This should resolve the index out of range error and pass the failing test.
