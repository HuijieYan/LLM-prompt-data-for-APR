The buggy function `match` is failing to return the correct output, causing the failing test. This is due to the fact that it splits the script by spaces and then checks if the second element is 'stash', resulting in an IndexError if the script only contains one element. This is confirmed by the GitHub issue which states that the rule fails when the script is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to 'stash'. If the split returns only one element, then we should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 and then proceed with the comparison. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
