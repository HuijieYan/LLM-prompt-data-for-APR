## Analysis
The buggy function is a part of a code that is used to fix git commands in a specific environment. 
The function is using the `split()` method on the `command.script` to check if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error locations in the buggy function are the use of `split()[1]` assuming that the command always has at least two words, and the assumption that 'usage:' in the stderr indicates an error.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not handling the case where the command might have less than two words, or where 'usage:' might not indicate an error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command has at least two words before accessing the second word using `split()[1]`. Additionally, we need to verify if 'usage:' in `command.stderr` is really indicating an error.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
