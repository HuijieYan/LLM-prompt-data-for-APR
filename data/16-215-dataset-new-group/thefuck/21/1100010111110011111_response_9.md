The buggy function is a `git_support` decorator for the `match` function, where the function checks if the second word in the command is `'stash'` and if it returns a usage message in `stderr`.

The potential error location is the `command.script.split()[1]` expression, which attempts to get the second word of the `command.script` but could result in an `IndexError` if the `command.script` doesn't have enough words.

The cause of the bug is that when the `command.script` is just `'git'`, the `split()` method returns only one element and trying to access the second element (`[1]`) causes an `IndexError`. This is evident in the failing test where the `command.script` is `'git'` and `stderr` contains the expected usage message for the stash command.

To fix the bug, a condition should be added to check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before trying to access the second word. If the length is less than 2, the function should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
