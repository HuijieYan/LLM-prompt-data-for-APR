The buggy function is designed to check if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the stderr. This enables the function to only match commands with 'git' as the first word and 'stash' as the second word where the usage is incorrect.

The potential error is in the condition of the return statement where it only checks for 'stash' and 'usage:' in the command.stderr. It does not validate 'git' as the first word in the command.

The bug in the function is that it does not check for the first word in the command to be 'git', which is necessary to ensure that the function only matches the expected commands. This can cause the function to match incorrect commands.

To fix the bug, update the condition in the return statement to check for 'git' as the first word, 'stash' as the second word, and 'usage:' in the command.stderr.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
