The buggy function `match` is supposed to match a command that starts with `git stash`. However, the test `test_not_match` is expecting the match function to return `False` when the command is just `git`, which will inadvertently lead to the error `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, the function `match` should be updated to check if the second word of the `command.script` is being compared with 'stash'. It also needs to handle cases where the command is not starting with 'git stash', so that an `IndexError` is not raised.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (script_words[0] == 'git' and len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
