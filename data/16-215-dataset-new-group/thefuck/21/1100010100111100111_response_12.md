The bug in the function is due to the assumption that the command.script will always have at least 2 elements when splitting it and then accessing the second element. When the command.script is just 'git', there is only one element after the split, resulting in the 'list index out of range' error.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where the command.script is just 'git', which will prevent the 'list index out of range' error.
