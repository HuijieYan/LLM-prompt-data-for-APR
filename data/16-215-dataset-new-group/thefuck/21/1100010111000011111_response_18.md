The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the `git stash` command was entered incorrectly and produced an error message with the text "usage:". However, the buggy function does not handle the case where the script is just "git" and not "git stash", leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to access the second item in the split command. 

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command is referring to "git" and not "git stash". If it is "git stash", then we can proceed to check for the error message. If not, we can return False. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    if command.script.split()[1] != 'stash':
        return False
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This version first checks if the command has more than one part. If not, it returns False. Then, it checks if the second part of the command is "stash". If not, it returns False. Finally, it checks if the error message contains "usage:" and returns the result. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
