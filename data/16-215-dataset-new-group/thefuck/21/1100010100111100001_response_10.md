The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces and then access the second element of the resulting list. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'` which results in a list `['git']`. So, trying to access the second element of this list will cause an `IndexError` since there is no second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
