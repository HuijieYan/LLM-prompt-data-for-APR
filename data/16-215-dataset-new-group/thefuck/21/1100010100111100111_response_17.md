The issue with the buggy function `match` is that it is trying to access the second element from the list obtained by splitting `command.script`, without checking if the list is empty or not.

Let's fix the bug by adding a check to ensure that there are at least two elements in the list obtained by splitting `command.script`, before trying to access the second element.


```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, we first check if the `script_parts` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function will return False, avoiding the IndexError that was previously occurring. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test.
