The buggy function is designed to check if the command is related to 'git stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the current implementation is not checking for the specific subcommands of 'git stash' such as 'list', 'show', or 'drop'.

The bug in the function is that it only checks for the presence of the word 'stash' in the command but does not verify the specific subcommands of 'git stash'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the specific subcommands of 'git stash' and also the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (split_script[0] == 'git'
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly check for the specific 'git stash' subcommands and the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, thereby addressing the bug in the original function.
