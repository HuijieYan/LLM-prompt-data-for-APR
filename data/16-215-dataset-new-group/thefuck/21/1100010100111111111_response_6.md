Given the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the buggy function is trying to access the second index of the split command script, which is resulting in an IndexError when the command script is only 'git'.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to first check if the script has enough elements to split, and then check if the second element is 'stash'. We can also check if the error message contains 'usage:' to ensure that the function is matching the correct scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 
            and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the issue posted in GitHub about the git_fix_stash rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
