The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, it fails when the command script is just 'git', as it tries to split the script by space and access the second element in the list, which causes an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to first check the length of the split script and then access the second element. If the length is less than 2, we can directly return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, the function will now first check the length of the split script before trying to access the second element, preventing the IndexError. This should resolve the issue and make the function work as intended, passing the failing test.
