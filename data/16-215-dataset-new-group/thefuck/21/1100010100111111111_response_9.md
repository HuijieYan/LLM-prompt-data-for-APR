The error in the buggy function is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when split by whitespace. This assumption leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split list, which only contains one element in the failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements when split by whitespace before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will not attempt to access the second element of the split list unless it contains at least two elements, preventing the `IndexError` that occurred in the failing test case.
