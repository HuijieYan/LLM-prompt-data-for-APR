The buggy function `match` in the git_fix_stash.py rule is failing due to a list index out of range error. This is occurring because the function is attempting to access the second element of the split command script without first checking if it exists.

The error message indicates that the failing test is due to the `match` function being called with a Command object that has an empty script.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the length of the split command script is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of the split script before accessing the second element, we can avoid the list index out of range error and ensure that the function works correctly in cases where the script may be empty. This should resolve the reported GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test passes.
