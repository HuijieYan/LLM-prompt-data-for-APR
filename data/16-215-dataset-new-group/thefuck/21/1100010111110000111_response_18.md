Following are the steps to fix the buggy function and output a corrected version:

1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, and the GitHub issue:
   - The buggy function `match` is using the `command.script.split()[1]` which means it is expecting a second element in the split list, which is causing an "IndexError" when the split list does not have a second element.
   - The failing test code is checking `assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))`, and the corresponding error message is "IndexError: list index out of range" due to the `split()[1]` operation when `command.script` does not have a second element.
   - The GitHub issue is titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" and the detailed description points out the "IndexError" in the `git_fix_stash.py` file.

2. Potential error location within the buggy function:
   - The potential error location is the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which is not handling the case when `split()` does not yield at least two elements.

3. Explanation of the cause of the bug:
   - The buggy function is failing due to an "IndexError" which is occurring when the `split()[1]` operation is performed on `command.script`.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Check if the split list has at least two elements before performing the `split()[1]` operation to avoid the "IndexError".
   - Handle the case when the split list does not have enough elements to access the second element.

5. Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With the corrected version, the function first checks if the split list has more than one element using `len(split_command) > 1` and then accesses the second element using `split_command[1]`. This will prevent the "IndexError" and the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
