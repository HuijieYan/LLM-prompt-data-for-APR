The buggy function is throwing an IndexError because of the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This error occurs when the `split()` method does not produce enough elements to index. In this case, it seems that the `command.script` does not contain enough words to split.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check the length of the split result before trying to access its elements. If the split result has enough elements, then we can proceed with the comparison. Otherwise, the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version checks the length of the split result and only accesses the second element if it exists. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring and make the function work as intended.
