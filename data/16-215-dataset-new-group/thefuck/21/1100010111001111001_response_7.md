The bug in the `match` function is that it is checking for the presence of the entire error message in `command.stderr` instead of just checking if the command is 'stash'. The function should return True if the script contains the word 'stash' and the error message contains 'usage:', otherwise it should return False.


Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
