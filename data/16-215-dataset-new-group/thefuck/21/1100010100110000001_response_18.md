The buggy function is `match` from the `git_fix_stash` file. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash` file, within the `match` function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`, but the list is empty, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script` is not empty before trying to split it and access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
