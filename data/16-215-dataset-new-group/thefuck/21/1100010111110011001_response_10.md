### Strategy for fixing the bug
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` string and access the second element, assuming that it exists. However, in the failing test, the `command.script` does not contain any space-separated elements, which is causing the `IndexError`. 
To fix the bug, we need to handle this edge case by checking if the split operation results in at least two elements before accessing the second element.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
