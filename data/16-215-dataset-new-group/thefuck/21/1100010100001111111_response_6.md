To fix the bug in the `match` function, we need to add a check to verify if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This fix ensures that the function checks for the length of the list before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, the function returns `False`, which resolves the `IndexError` issue.
