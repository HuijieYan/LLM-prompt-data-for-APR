### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the command is a Git stash command and if it produces an error. However, the function is incorrectly checking for the presence of the word "usage:" in the stderr to identify an error.

### Identification of Error
The buggy line is:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The function incorrectly checks for 'usage:' in the command.stderr to identify an error, which is not a reliable method.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes that the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr will always indicate an error. This assumption is not always true, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Change the way the function identifies an error. Instead of checking for the presence of 'usage:', the function should check if the stderr starts with the string 'error:'. This is a more reliable method to identify an error in Git commands.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr.strip().startswith('error:'))
```
