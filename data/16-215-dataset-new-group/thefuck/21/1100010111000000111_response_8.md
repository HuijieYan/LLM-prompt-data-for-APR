The bug in the function `match` is likely caused by the assumption that the second word in the `git` command script will always be `'stash'`. However, the failing test and the GitHub issue's description indicate that the script is just `'git'`, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to split the script by spaces and access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check for the condition where the script is just `'git'` and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and
            script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first checks if there are more than one word in the `git` command script, and only then proceeds to check if the second word is `'stash'`. This modification prevents the `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'`. With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
