## The cause of the bug
The buggy function `match` checks if the command script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` asserts that the buggy function should not match a Command with `git` in the script and `git_stash_err` in the stderr. The error message when running the failing test indicates that the buggy function fails with an IndexError, caused by a list index out of range.

The GitHub issue titled "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git" reports the error message and identifies the specific problem with the buggy function.

## Potential error location within the buggy function
The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`. If the `command.script` does not contain more than one element, accessing index 1 can result in an IndexError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The buggy function should be modified to first check if the `command.script` contains 'stash', then check the `stderr` for 'usage:'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and ensure that the function works as intended.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
