The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is causing an `IndexError` because the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`, which doesn't exist when `command.script` is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we can avoid the `IndexError` and the function will work correctly when `command.script` is just `'git'`.

This correction should resolve the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding the bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule.
