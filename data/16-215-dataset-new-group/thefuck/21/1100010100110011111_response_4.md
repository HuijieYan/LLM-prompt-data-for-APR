## Cause of the bug
The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if it exists. This causes an IndexError when the list is empty. The bug occurs specifically when the `command.script` is simply 'git' without any additional arguments, causing the split to result in an empty list.

## Fix strategy
We should first check if the list resulting from `command.script.split()` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If the list doesn't have enough elements, we should return False. Additionally, we should also check if the command is 'stash' and the 'usage:' is present in the command.stderr.

## Corrected implementation
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
