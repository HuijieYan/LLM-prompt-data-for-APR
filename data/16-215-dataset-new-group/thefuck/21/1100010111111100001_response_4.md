## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script.split() and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

The buggy function is failing for the test_not_match() test case because it is trying to access index 1 of the splited_script list without checking if the list contains more than one element.

The corrected version of the function now checks if 'stash' is in the command.script and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr. If both conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
