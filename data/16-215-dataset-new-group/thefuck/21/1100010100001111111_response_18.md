The bug is caused by the buggy function attempting to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if it exists first. This results in an `IndexError` if the script is just `'git'`. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before comparing the second element to `'stash'`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the length of `script_parts` is at least 2 before trying to access the second element and compare it to `'stash'`. This should resolve the `IndexError` when the script is just `'git'` and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
