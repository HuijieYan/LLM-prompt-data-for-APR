The problem is that the buggy function assumes there will always be a second element in `command.script.split()`, but when the `command` has only the script 'git', this assumption fails.

To fix this, we can check the length of `command.script.split()` before accessing its second element to ensure it exists.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
