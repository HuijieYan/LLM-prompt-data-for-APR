The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the stderr contains the string "usage:". However, the current implementation only checks for the word "stash" in the command script, without considering the presence of the word "git" before it.

The bug occurs because the function is only checking for the word "stash" in the command script, without considering the context of the command being a git command.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script starts with "git" and if the second word is "stash".

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (script_parts[0] == 'git' 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
