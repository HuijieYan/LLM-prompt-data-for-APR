The buggy function is failing due to an IndexError: list index out of range, which occurs when trying to access an index in a list where the index does not exist.

The identified potential error location within the buggy function is the expression 'command.script.split()[1]', which attempts to access the second element of the split command script.

The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming the presence of a second element in the split command script without checking its existence. This causes an IndexError when the script is just 'git', and there is no second element.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the split command script has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This updated version first splits the command script into elements and then checks if the length of the split script is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element. This prevents the IndexError from occurring and ensures that the function works as expected.
