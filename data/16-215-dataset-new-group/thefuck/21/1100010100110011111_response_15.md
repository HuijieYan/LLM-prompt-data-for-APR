## Analysis
The function `match` is supposed to identify if the command is a git stash command by checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message indicates an IndexError due to the `command.script.split()` returning an empty list, causing the list index out of range error.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the handling of the command script. When the command.script is just 'git', the split function will return an empty list, leading to the IndexError.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to access the second element of the split command, assuming that it is always present. When the command script is just 'git', this assumption breaks, leading to the IndexError. 

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should check if the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If the split command has less than two elements, it should not proceed with the comparison and return False instead.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
