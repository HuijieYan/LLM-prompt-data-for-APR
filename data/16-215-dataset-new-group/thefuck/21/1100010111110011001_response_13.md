Based on the error message and failing test, it appears that the buggy function is trying to access an element in the command.script list without checking if it exists. This causes an IndexError when the list is empty.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command.script list is empty before trying to access elements in it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
