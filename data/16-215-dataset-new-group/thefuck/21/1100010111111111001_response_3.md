The bug in the given function is that it attempts to split the command.script without checking for its length, leading to a potential IndexError when accessing the second element of the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will now check if the split list has at least 2 elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.
