### Analysis
The `match` function currently checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. This seems incorrect, as it's unclear what the intended behavior should be.

### Bug
The bug here is that the `match` function only checks for 'stash' in the command's script, and 'usage:' in the command's stderr. It doesn't check if the command as a whole is `git stash` or something else. As a result, it fails when provided with different inputs.

### Fix
We should check the entire command to ensure it's `git stash` and also handle different scenarios of command variations.

### Corrected code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script_parts
    return (len(parts) >= 2 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and ('usage:' in command.stderr or 'git: "stash" is not a git command.') in command.stderr)
```
