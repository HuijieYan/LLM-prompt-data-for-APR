The bug occurs in the `git_fix_stash` rule when the script is just "git" and does not contain "stash". The `match` function tries to split the script and access the second element without checking if it exists, resulting in a `IndexError: list index out of range` when no elements are present after splitting.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) > 1 
        and split_script[1] == "stash" 
        and "usage:" in command.stderr
    )
```

This fix ensures that the split command has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
