The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the command script is for Git stash and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". This function is failing when the script is just "git", which results in an IndexError because it tries to access the second element of the split script, which does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script contains "stash" before trying to access the second element of the split script. If the script does not contain "stash", the function should return False. Additionally, we should handle the case where the stderr is not present, as it could also cause issues when accessing the "usage:" string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2 or 'stash' not in script_parts:  # Check if the script is related to git stash
        return False
    if 'usage:' in command.stderr:  # Check if the stderr contains "usage:"
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected version first checks if the script contains "stash" and the length of the script is at least 2 to avoid the IndexError. Then, it checks if the stderr contains "usage:" and returns True accordingly. If any of the conditions fail, it returns False. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
