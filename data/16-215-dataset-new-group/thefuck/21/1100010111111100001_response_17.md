The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command passed as input is a git stash command and if the error message contains the word "usage:". However, the buggy function is causing an IndexError due to trying to access the second element of the `splited_script` list from `command.script.split()` without ensuring that the list has more than 1 element.


### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the `command.script` will always be split into multiple elements, which is not the case when the input command is just "git". This assumption leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into parts and then check if it contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This ensures that we avoid the IndexError and the function should now pass the failing test.
