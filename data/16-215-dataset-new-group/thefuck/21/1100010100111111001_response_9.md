The buggy function is designed to check if the command entered by the user is related to the "git stash" operation and whether the error message includes the word "usage:". However, the buggy function fails with an IndexError due to an attempt to split the command.script without checking its length.

An effective strategy to fix the bug is to first verify that the command has at least two elements (including the 'stash' operation) before attempting to access the second element for comparison. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the "usage:" keyword is present in the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this fix, the corrected function will return True if the conditions are met, and False otherwise, which should satisfy the expected input/output values.
