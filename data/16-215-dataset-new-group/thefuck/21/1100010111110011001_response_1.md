### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is a `git stash` command by looking for 'stash' in the second part of the command script and checking for the 'usage:' in the command stderr. However, the buggy function is throwing an `IndexError` because of `command.script.split()[1]` when the command script does not have more than one word.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `match` function is that it assumes there will always be a second word in the command script, leading to an `IndexError` when that assumption is not met.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We should first check if the command script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. If it does not, then the command is not a `git stash` command, so we can return `False` immediately. Additionally, we need to check if `command.stderr` contains 'usage:' to confirm that it is a `git stash` command.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
