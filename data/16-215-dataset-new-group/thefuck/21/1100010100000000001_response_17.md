The buggy function is designed to match a command in a git environment that involves using the 'stash' command and has an error message containing 'usage:'. The function splits the command script and checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.

The potential error in the buggy function is that it does not handle cases where the command script does not have a second element, resulting in an 'IndexError'. It also does not handle cases where the stderr is not present, which could result in a 'NoneType' error.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for different scenarios where the script or stderr may not contain the expected elements, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, we can add validation checks to ensure that both the script and stderr are present and have the expected elements before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1 and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash')
    else:
        return False
```
