The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule fails because the `split` method on the `command.script` might result in an IndexError if the script is just "git" and has no other arguments.

To fix this bug, we can check if the length of the splitted script is greater than 1 before checking the index. If it's not, then we can return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    if len(splitted_script) > 1:
        return (splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This should resolve the IndexError issue and make the function work as expected for the given input/output values and fix the reported issue on GitHub.
