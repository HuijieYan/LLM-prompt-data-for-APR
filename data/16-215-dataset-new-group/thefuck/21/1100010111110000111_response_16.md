### Error Analysis
The buggy function is a `match` function that checks if the input command is related to `git stash` and has a specific error message in the stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` checks if this function works correctly, which it doesn't due to an IndexError.

The error occurs in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. The cause of the bug is that the function assumes that `command.script.split()` will have a length of at least 2, so it is trying to access `[1]` for comparison. However, if the script is just `git` without any additional arguments after it, the split will return a list of length 1.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by first checking if the length of the split array is at least 2 before accessing the element at index 1. If it's not, we can safely assume that it does not match the desired condition and return False.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
