The buggy function `match` is attempting to split the command script and then check if the second item is `stash`, while also checking if the command has a usage message in the stderr. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, which means that the `split` function is not finding a second item in the command script.

Looking at the failing test and the provided error message, it seems that when the command is just `git` without any arguments, the function fails because there are no items to split. This leads to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second item from the split list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there are enough items to split and then proceed with the comparison. We can also add a check to ensure that the git command includes the argument 'stash' before accessing the split items.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_script) > 1
            and command_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will check if the command script has more than one item, and then proceed with the comparison. If the condition `len(command_script) > 1` is not satisfied, it will return `False`, avoiding the `IndexError`. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
