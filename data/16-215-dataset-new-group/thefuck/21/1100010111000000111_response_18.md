### Analysis:
The `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is expected to check if the stderr of the `git` command contains the string "usage:". However, the buggy `match` function is using `command.script` to split and access the elements, resulting in an IndexError.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` without checking if it contains any elements. When the `command.script` does not contain any elements, it raises an IndexError.

### Bug Fix:
We need to check if the `command.script` contains any elements before trying to access the second element to avoid the IndexError.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of `script_elements` before accessing the second element, we can prevent the IndexError. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
