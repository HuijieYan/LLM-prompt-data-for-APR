The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` and access the second element without checking if the list is empty. This causes an `IndexError` when the list is empty.

To fix this, we need to first check if the `command.script` is non-empty before trying to split it and access its elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
