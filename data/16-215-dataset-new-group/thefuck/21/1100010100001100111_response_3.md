The bug in the `git_fix_stash` function is that it is not checking whether the `command.script` contains 'stash' before trying to split it, causing an Index Error when the command is just 'git'. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than the index being accessed before trying to access it.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification will prevent the Index Error from occurring and will ensure that the function returns the correct result based on the `command` input.
