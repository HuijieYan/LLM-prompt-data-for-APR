The buggy function has an issue with the use of `command.script.split()[1]` and also with the condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr`. The `command.script.split()[1]` is causing an IndexError when the script is just 'gitâ€™, and the condition `'usage:' in command.stderr` is indicating the presence of 'usage:' in the output. This condition is not the desired one as it is not ensuring that the script is just 'git' without any arguments or options.

The following is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[0] == 'git' 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' not in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected function, we first split the script and ensure that it consists of at least two parts. Then we check if the first part of the script is 'git' and the second part is 'stash'. Additionally, we ensure that 'usage:' is not present in the command's stderr.

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
