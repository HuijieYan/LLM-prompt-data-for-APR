The bug in the `match` function appears to be caused by the use of `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the command has at least two words. The function seems to be trying to check if the second word in the `script` attribute of the `command` is 'stash', and if the 'usage:' string is found in the `stderr` attribute.

The `IndexError` that is being raised indicates that the split operation is being performed on a string that does not contain a space, resulting in a single-element list. This causes the function to attempt to access the second element of the list when it does not exist, leading to the error.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to check the length of the split command before attempting to access the second element. Additionally, it would be helpful to remove any newline characters from the `stderr` attribute before checking for 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr.replace('\n', '')
    return False
```
