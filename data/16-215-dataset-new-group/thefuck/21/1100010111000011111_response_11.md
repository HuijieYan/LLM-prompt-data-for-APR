The issue seems to be related to an IndexError caused by the attempt to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list when the split list is empty. This suggests that the `command.script` might be an empty string, which leads to the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least 2 elements before trying to access the second element. We can also add a guard clause to check if the command.script starts with "git", as that seems to be the intended use case based on the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[0] == 'git' and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This version checks if the split list has at least 2 elements and if the first element is 'git', before checking the second element for 'stash'.
