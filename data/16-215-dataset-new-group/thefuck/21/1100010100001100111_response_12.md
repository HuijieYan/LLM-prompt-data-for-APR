### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` string and check if the second element is equal to 'stash'. However, when the input `command.script` is just `'git'`, the split will only result in one element, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to check if `command.script` contains the string 'stash' and has other elements before splitting the string to avoid the `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
