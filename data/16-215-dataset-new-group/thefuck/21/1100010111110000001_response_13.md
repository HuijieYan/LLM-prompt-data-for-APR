The buggy function `match` is supposed to determine if the command passed to it is a git stash command and if the stderr contains "usage:". The buggy function fails to do so as it throws an IndexError when trying to split `command.script` and access the second element.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle cases where `command.script` may not have a second element after splitting. This is evident from the error message which indicates "IndexError: list index out of range".

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to first check if the split command has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and 
            script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
