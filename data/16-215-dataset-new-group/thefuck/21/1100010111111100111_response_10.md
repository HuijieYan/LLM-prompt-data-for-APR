The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if a certain command matches the git stash and returns `True` or `False`. The bug is caused by attempting to access an index in `command.script.split()` that does not exist, leading to an IndexError.

The failing test is `test_not_match`, which is expected to return `False` when the command does not match the provided stderr error message. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file.

Based on the provided runtime values, the variable `splited_script` is set to `['git']`, which is a list with only one element. The bug occurs when the buggy function tries to access index 1 in this list, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, you should check if there are at least two elements in the `splited_script` list before trying to access the second element. If there are not, the function should return `False`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function checks whether there are at least two elements in the `splited_script` list, and if so, it proceeds to compare the second element with 'stash', returning `True` or `False` accordingly. This fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
