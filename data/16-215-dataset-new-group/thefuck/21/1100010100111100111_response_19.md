The bug in the function `match` is causing an IndexError due to the `command.script.split()[1]` expression. This indicates that the script command does not contain more than one word. The error message and the runtime input parameter values confirm this.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, then compare the second split element with 'stash'. Otherwise, return False. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring when trying to access index 1 of the split command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
