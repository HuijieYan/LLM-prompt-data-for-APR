The problem with the original `match` function is that it assumes the `command.script` will have at least two items after splitting by whitespace, and then it checks if the second item is equal to 'stash'. However, the test case is using a `Command` object with only 'git' as the script, which does not meet the assumption made in the original `match` function, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second item.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check the length of the `command.script` after splitting, and only then compare the second item to 'stash'. If the length is less than 2, the function should return `False` since it doesn't match the condition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version checks the length of the `script_parts` list before trying to access the second item to prevent the `IndexError`. After the fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
