### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the `git` command is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is causing an IndexError due to an assumption about the structure of the `command.script` parameter.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will have multiple parts separated by spaces, and the second part will always be the action (like 'stash'). However, this assumption is not always valid, leading to an IndexError when trying to access an index that does not exist.

### Fix Strategy
The buggy function needs to be modified to safely check if the command is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'. This can be done by splitting the `command.script` and handling the IndexError if the split does not result in the expected parts.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
