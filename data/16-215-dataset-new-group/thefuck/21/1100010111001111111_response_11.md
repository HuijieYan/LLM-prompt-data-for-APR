The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. However, the code is not checking if there are any words in `command.script` at all, leading to an `IndexError` when the input is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are at least two words in `command.script` before trying to access the second word. Then we can proceed with checking if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function will now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just 'git'.
