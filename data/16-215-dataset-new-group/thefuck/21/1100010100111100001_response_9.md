The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. The error message is indicating an IndexError, specifically that the list index is out of range.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not have a check if the script parameter actually contains any elements after splitting. This causes an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the list.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the command.script has at least 2 elements after splitting, and then check if the second element is 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
