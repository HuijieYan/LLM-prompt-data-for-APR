The buggy function is attempting to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list, which results in an IndexError when the list has fewer than two elements. This is causing the failing test, as evidenced by the provided error message and runtime values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of the `splited_script` list and then accessing the second element, it ensures that the function will not encounter an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
