## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` and compare the second element with the string 'stash'. However, if the `command.script` is just 'git', the split operation will result in a list with only one element, causing an IndexError.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split. When the `command.script` is just 'git', the split operation results in a list with only one element, causing the IndexError.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split operation will result in a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element for comparison.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1
            and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version checks if the split operation will result in a list with at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. If the split operation will not result in a list with at least two elements, the function will return False, avoiding the IndexError.
