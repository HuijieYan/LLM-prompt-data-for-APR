## The buggy function with comments
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # This function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash 
    # and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

## Bug analysis
The function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. However, the bug occurs because there is no check for the length of the split command.script. If the command.script does not have at least two elements (such as when the command is just "git" with no additional parameters), this will raise an IndexError when trying to access the second element (index 1) in the split list.

## Bug fix
A strategy to fix the bug is to add a check for the length of the split command.script before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it means the command is not related to git stash, so the function should return False.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the script is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```
