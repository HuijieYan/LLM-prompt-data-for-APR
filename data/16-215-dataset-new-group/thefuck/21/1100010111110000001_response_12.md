The bug in the `match` function is causing an IndexError because it's attempting to split the command script and access the second element without checking if the split actually results in two or more elements.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result contains more than one element before accessing the second element to prevent the IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of `split_script`, we ensure that there are at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This should fix the IndexError and make the function work correctly.
