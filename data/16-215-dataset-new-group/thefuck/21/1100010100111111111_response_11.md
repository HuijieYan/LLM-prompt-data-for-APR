The buggy function is the `match` function, which is part of the `git_fix_stash` rule in the `thefuck` library. The function is expected to determine whether the input command is related to a Git stash operation based on the script and stderr. 

The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file, specifically within the `match` function.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle cases where the script contains only one word, as evidenced by the error message "IndexError: list index out of range". This suggests that `command.script.split()` is resulting in a list with just one element, and attempting to access the second element is causing the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split command resulted in a list with multiple elements before trying to access the second element.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version first splits the script into words, checks if there are at least two elements in the resulting list, and then proceeds to compare the second element with 'stash'. This change ensures that behavior is consistent for cases where the script contains only one word.
