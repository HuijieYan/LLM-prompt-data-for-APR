To fix the bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule, it appears that the buggy function is attempting to access and compare elements of the `command.script` after splitting it. However, it is assumed that the `command.script` always contains at least one element after splitting, which is not the case in the failing test.

The `IndexError: list index out of range` error arises from an attempt to access an index of a list that does not exist. This implies that there are no elements after splitting `command.script`.

To address this issue, the buggy function should be modified to first check if the `command.script` contains the expected 'stash' command before attempting to access and compare individual elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, the function first splits the `command.script` into parts and then checks if there are at least two parts, and if the second part is indeed 'stash'. Only then does it proceed to compare and return the result.

This should resolve the `IndexError` and ensure that the function behaves as expected, passing the failing test and addressing the GitHub issue.
