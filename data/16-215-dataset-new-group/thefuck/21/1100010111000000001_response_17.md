The buggy function 'match' is meant to check if the stderr output contains the string 'usage:' when the command script contains the word 'stash'. However, the bug is in the return statement where it checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This logic is flawed because it does not check if the first word in the command is 'git'. 

The bug is causing the test_not_match to fail because it's expecting the match function to return False for a command like "git stash" which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement in the 'match' function to also check if the first word in the command script is 'git'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (script_words[0] == 'git'
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the match function will now properly check if the first word in the command is 'git', the second word is 'stash', and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.
