To fix the bug in the `match` function, we need to handle the case when the `command.script` does not contain the expected elements.

The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming that `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when split, and this assumption is not true when the script is just "git".

To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split `command.script` to ensure it contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the length of `script_elements` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` that was occurring in the original buggy function.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just "git".
