### Analysis
The buggy function is using `command.script.split()[1]` to check if the second part of the command is 'stash' and simultaneously checking if the `command.stderr` contains 'usage:'. This could potentially cause an IndexError if the second part of the command is not present or if it is 'stash' and the `command.stderr` doesn't contain 'usage:'.

### Bug
The bug is caused by not handling the possibility of IndexError when trying to access the second part of the command, and not checking if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the command has at least two parts before accessing the second part to avoid IndexError.
2. Use the `in` keyword to check if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
