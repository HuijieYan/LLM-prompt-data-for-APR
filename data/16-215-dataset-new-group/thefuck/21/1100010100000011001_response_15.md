### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is equal to 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains 'usage:'. If both conditions are met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

### Identified potential error locations
1. The function is not checking if the `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word.
2. It's possible that the 'usage:' string may be present in the `command.stderr` for reasons other than an incorrect usage of the 'stash' command.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs when the `command.script` does not have a second word or if the 'usage:' string is present in `command.stderr` for reasons other than an incorrect usage of the 'stash' command.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if the `command.script` has at least two words before trying to access the second word.
2. Validate the presence of the 'usage:' string in `command.stderr` in an appropriate context related to the 'stash' command.

### Corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
