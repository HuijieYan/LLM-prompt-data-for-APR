## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function is attempting to match a git command to see if it involves the "stash" operation and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". However, there are several potential error locations within the function.

## Potential error locations
1. The function does not check if the git command starts with "git".
2. The function assumes that the "stash" operation is always the second word in the command.
3. The function directly accesses the stderr attribute of the command, which may not always be present.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that the "stash" operation is always the second word in the git command, as well as the direct access to the stderr attribute without checking for its presence.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the git command starts with "git", extract the operation from the command in a more robust way, and handle the possibility that the stderr attribute may not be present.

## Corrected version of the function

@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) > 1 and parts[0] == 'git':
        operation = parts[1]
        return (operation == 'stash' and
                (hasattr(command, 'stderr') and 'usage:' in command.stderr))
    return False
```
