## The buggy function and its relationship with test code, error message, and GitHub issue

The buggy function is a `git_support` decorated function that checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

In the failing test, the `match` function is called with a `Command` object that has `"git"` as the script and an error similar to the one described in the GitHub issue.

The error message indicates an IndexError at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file, which corresponds to the line that checks if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash'.

The GitHub issue provides further context, describing a situation where the script is just "git" and the existence of an error trace related to the rule.

## Identify Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function
The potential error location within the buggy function is the line that is trying to access the second word of the `command.script`, which may not exist if `command.script` is just "git".

## Explain the Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is an IndexError occurring when trying to access the second word of `command.script` when it may not exist. This aligns with the information provided in the GitHub issue where the script is just "git", resulting in the list index out of range error when trying to access element 1 of the split `command.script`.

## Suggest a Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check the length of `command.script` before trying to access its second word. If the length is less than 2, it means the script does not have a second word, and the function should return False.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) >= 2:
        return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we first split `command.script` into words and then check if the length of the resulting list is at least 2. If it is, we proceed to check if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in `command.stderr`. If the length is less than 2, we return False.
