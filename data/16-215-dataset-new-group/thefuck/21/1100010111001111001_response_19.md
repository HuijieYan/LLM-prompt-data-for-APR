The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the command.stderr contains the word "usage:". However, the stderr might contain the word "usage:" even if the command is not "git stash". This is causing the function to incorrectly match commands that are not "git stash".

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check only the first word in the command script and ensure that it is "stash". Then, we should check if the stderr contains the full "usage: git stash" line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr)
```
