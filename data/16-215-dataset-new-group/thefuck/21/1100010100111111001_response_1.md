The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, it fails to handle cases where there is no word after 'git' in the script.

The cause of the bug is that the script.split() method is splitting the command script into a list using whitespace as a delimiter, and when there is no word after 'git' in the script, the list only contains one element, leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that the script.split() method does not result in a list with less than two elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
