### Expected case 1
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
command.script, string

command, Command object

command.stderr, string

#### Expected values and types of relevant variables
Return: False, boolean

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the fact that the function is checking for the word 'usage:' in the whole `command.stderr` string, instead of the individual lines of the `stderr`. This causes the function to return `True` when it shouldn't.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to split the `stderr` into lines and check for 'usage:' in each line. We can then return `True` if 'usage:' is found anywhere, but also return `False` if the line after 'usage:' starts with 'git stash'.

## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'usage:' in line:
            return not line.startswith('git stash')
    return False
```
