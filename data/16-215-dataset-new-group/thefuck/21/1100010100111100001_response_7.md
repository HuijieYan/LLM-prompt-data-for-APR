The buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` and access its second element without checking if the list has at least that many elements. This causes an `IndexError` when the function tries to access an element that doesn't exist.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to verify that the `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected function, the test case should pass successfully.
