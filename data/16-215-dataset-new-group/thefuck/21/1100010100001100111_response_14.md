## Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, the issue is that when the `command.script` is only 'git', the split operation will result in a list with only one element, causing the index out of range error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by first checking if the length of the `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
With this correction, the function will first check if the length of the split `script` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element to avoid the index out of range error.
