To fix the bug, we need to update the match function to handle cases where the command.script doesn't contain the expected arguments. This can be done by first checking the length of the script and then proceeding with the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    if len(script) > 1:
        return (script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This updated function first splits the command.script and checks if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1. If it is, it compares the second element of the list with 'stash' and the command.stderr for the string 'usage:'. If the length is not greater than 1, it returns False.

With this update, the match function should now correctly handle cases where the command.script doesn't contain the expected arguments, resolving the IndexError that was causing the failing test.
