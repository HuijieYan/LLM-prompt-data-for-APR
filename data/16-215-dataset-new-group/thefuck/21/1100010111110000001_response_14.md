## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the error message contains the string "usage:". However, the buggy function has an issue in its logic that causes an `IndexError` when trying to split the command script.

## Bug Identification
The bug in the current function is occurring because it is attempting to split the command script without checking if the script contains at least two elements.

## Bug Explanation
The failing test is trying to validate that the function does not match a command with a specific error message related to `git stash`, but it is failing with an `IndexError`. This is happening because the buggy `match` function is not considering cases where the command script might not have enough elements to split.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by first checking the length of the split command script before attempting to access its elements.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1
            and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
