## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" in the buggy function. This occurs when trying to access an index in a list that does not exist.

In this case, the buggy function `match` expects the second word in the `command.script`, but when the script is just "git", it results in an IndexError.

## Bug Location
The buggy location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`, where it attempts to access the index 1 of the split script.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to split the script by space and access index 1 without checking if the split has more than 1 element. Therefore, when the `command.script` does not contain more than one word, it results in an IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command contains more than one element before trying to access index 1. This will prevent IndexError when the script is just "git".

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) > 1
        and split_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```
