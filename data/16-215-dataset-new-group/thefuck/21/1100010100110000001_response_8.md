The buggy function is `match` and it is being used to check if a git command is related to stashing. The function is splitting the `command.script` using whitespace and trying to access the second element in the split list. 

The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` is indicating that the split operation is not producing enough elements to access the second index.

The cause of the bug is that the `command.script` might not have enough elements to access the second index. This can happen if the `command.script` does not contain any whitespace, resulting in a single element list.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the split list contains enough elements before trying to access the second index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `split_script`. Then, we check if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second index. If it is, we proceed with the original conditions for the match, and this should fix the bug.
