Based on the error message and the provided information, it seems that the function is trying to split the command script and access its second element without checking whether the script is empty or not. This is causing an "IndexError: list index out of range" when the script is only "git".

To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that the script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function will first split the command script and then check whether it has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the "IndexError" from occurring.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
