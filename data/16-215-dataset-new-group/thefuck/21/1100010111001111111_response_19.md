The buggy function is failing because it is trying to access the second element of the `split()` list without checking if the list actually contains a second element. This results in an IndexError when the command.script is just 'git' and the buggy function tries to access `split()[1]`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if the length of the `split()` list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this corrected version, the function will first check if the length of the `split()` list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it will return False, avoiding the IndexError.
