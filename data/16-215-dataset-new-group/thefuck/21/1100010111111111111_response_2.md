The problem with the buggy function is that it assumes there will always be at least two elements in the `command.script.split()` operation, which is not the case when the script is just "git". This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function will now handle the case when the split list has fewer than two elements when the script is just "git", and it will return False in that case, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.
