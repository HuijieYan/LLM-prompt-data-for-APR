The bug in the provided function is that it expects the script to start with 'git' and then immediately followed by 'stash'. However, in the failing test, the script is just 'git', which results in an IndexError when trying to split the script.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments following it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and ('stash' in command.script.split() or 'stash' in command.stderr))
```

With this change, the function will now check if the script starts with 'git' and then either contains 'stash' in the script itself or in the stderr, effectively handling the case where the script is just 'git'.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
