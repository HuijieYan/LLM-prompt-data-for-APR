The buggy function is supposed to check if the git command entered is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr of the command. However, the function is incorrectly checking for the 'stash' keyword at the second position of the split command.script instead of the first position. 

To fix the bug, we need to check the first position of the split command.script and also update the check for 'usage:' in the command.stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' 
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
