### Analysis
The buggy function, `match`, is supposed to check if the command is a git stash and if the stderr contains the usage message. However, the function contains an error by checking for the 'stash' keyword at index 1 of the split script, which would not be accurate for all cases.

### Error Location
The error is located in the comparison of the second element in the split command script with the string 'stash'.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of the second element in the split command script with the string 'stash'. This would not accurately determine if the command is a git stash.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison should be based on the first element of the split script. Additionally, we need to check if the command is 'git' and the first argument is 'stash', with the stderr containing the 'usage:' message.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (script[0] == 'git'
            and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
