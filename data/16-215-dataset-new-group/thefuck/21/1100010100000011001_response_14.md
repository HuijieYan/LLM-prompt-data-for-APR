### Case 1
#### Input
- command.script = "git stash"
- command.stderr = "usage: git stash"
#### Expected Output
- True
#### Explanation
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. For the given input values, the condition should return True.
#### Bug
The bug is in the condition `(command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. If the command script is "git stash", then `command.script.split()[1]` is 'stash', which satisfies the first part of the condition. However, the second part of the condition is checking if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr, which is true in this case.
#### Fix
Update the condition to check if the first part of the command is 'stash' and if the entire stderr message contains 'usage:':
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
