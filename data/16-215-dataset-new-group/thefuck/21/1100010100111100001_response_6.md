The buggy function is designed to match the command input if the second part of the script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is found in the stderr of the command. However, it fails with an IndexError when trying to split the command script.

The cause of the bug is that the split() method is used on the command.script without checking if it contains at least two elements. This leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command.script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This can be done using a conditional statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will now first check if the command.script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and the function should now pass the failing test.
