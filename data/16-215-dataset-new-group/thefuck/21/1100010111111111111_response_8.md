The bug in the `match` function occurs because it assumes that `command.script` contains at least two elements when splitting it by spaces, and then tries to access the second element without checking its existence. This causes an `IndexError` when running the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to check whether the split command's result contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. We also need to make sure that the first element is 'git' and the second element is 'stash' to satisfy the condition.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git' and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, the `match` function will first check if the split result of `command.script` contains at least two elements. If it does, then it will proceed to check if the first element is 'git' and the second element is 'stash' before applying the rest of the conditions.

This correction should resolve the `IndexError` issue and make the function pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue related to this bug.
