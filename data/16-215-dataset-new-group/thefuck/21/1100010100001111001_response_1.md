The buggy function is supposed to check if the input command is related to the git stash command and if the stderr contains a usage message. However, it currently only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains a usage message.

The issue lies in the condition of the return statement, as it only checks for the second word and does not take into account the entire script.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the entire script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
