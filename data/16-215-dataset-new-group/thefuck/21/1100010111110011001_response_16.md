### Analysis
The buggy function `match` takes a `Command` object as a parameter and checks if the second word in the `script` attribute is `'stash'` and if the word `'usage:'` is in the `stderr` attribute. The error occurs due to an `IndexError` when trying to split the `script` attribute.

### Bug Cause
The bug is occurring because the `command.script.split()` call is assuming that there will always be at least two elements in the split list, leading to a potential `IndexError` when the split result is empty.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result is not empty before accessing the second element.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_terms = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_terms) > 1 and script_terms[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
