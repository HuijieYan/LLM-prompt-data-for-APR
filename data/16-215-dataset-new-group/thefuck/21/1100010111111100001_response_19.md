The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". It seems that the buggy function is causing an error because it is trying to split the command script without any error handling for cases where the script does not have multiple words.

The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" occurring at line 8 of the buggy function, which is where the split operation takes place.

To fix the bug, we need to add error handling to ensure that the script has at least two words before splitting it. If not, we can return False to indicate that the match is not found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the error handling to check the length of the script parts before accessing the second element, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring, and the function should now pass the failing test.
