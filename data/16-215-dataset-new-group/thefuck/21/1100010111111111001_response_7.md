The bug in the `match` function is causing an `IndexError` because it's trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if the list is long enough.

To fix the bug, we need to validate the length of the split list before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This correction adds a check to the split list's length, ensuring that the second element exists before attempting to access it. If the length is not sufficient, the function returns `False`, indicating that the condition is not met.
