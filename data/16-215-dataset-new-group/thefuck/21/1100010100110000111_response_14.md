### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the error message contains the word `usage:`. However, the error message and the corresponding error indicate an `IndexError`, showing that the `split` function is causing a problem.

### Error Location
The issue is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The `split()` function is causing the `IndexError`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that the `split()` function will always return a list of at least length 2, so accessing the index 1 directly without checking the length of the list is causing the `IndexError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check the length of the list obtained from `split()` before accessing index 1.

### Bug Fix
Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the function is as follows:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In this corrected version, the `split()` function is stored in a variable `split_script`, and its length is checked before accessing index 1. This ensures that the code doesn't throw an `IndexError`.
