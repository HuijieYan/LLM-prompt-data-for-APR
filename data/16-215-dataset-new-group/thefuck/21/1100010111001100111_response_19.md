The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule causes the rule to fail when the script is just 'git'. The `match` function currently fails to check for this condition.

The `match` function compares the second element of the `command.script.split()` list with the string 'stash', assuming that there will always be at least two elements in the list. However, when the script is just 'git', the split list will only contain one element, causing the `IndexError` as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to first check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. If there is only one element in the list, we can simply return `False` to indicate that the rule does not match.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the `match` function will first check if the split list has at least two elements before comparing the second element with 'stash'. If there is only one element in the list, it will return `False`, avoiding the `IndexError` and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
