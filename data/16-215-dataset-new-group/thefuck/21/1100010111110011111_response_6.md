The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to access split()[1] on the 'script' attribute of the 'command' parameter, causing an IndexError when the 'command' does not include the expected 'stash' keyword in the script. This behavior leads to a failing test with the corresponding error message indicating an IndexError: list index out of range.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of the split result is enough to access the list index before checking the value at that index.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version ensures that the split result has enough parts to access the index before checking the value at that index. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue.
