The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the script is 'stash', which may not cover all valid cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the phrase 'usage:'. We can achieve this by splitting the script into words and checking each word individually.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
