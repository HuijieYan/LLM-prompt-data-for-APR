The buggy function is a part of a git-specific rule in the "thefuck" library, which is used to fix common command line mistakes. The function is supposed to match a command that includes the word "stash" and has a specific error message in the stderr.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The split() method might cause an index error if the input command doesn't have multiple words.
2. The comparison might not accurately check for the presence of the word "stash" in the command.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison in the buggy function is too strict. It checks for an exact match with the word "stash" and for the presence of the specific error message in the stderr, which is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison to check if the word "stash" is present anywhere in the command, and also verify that the specific error message is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
This corrected version should pass the failing test.
