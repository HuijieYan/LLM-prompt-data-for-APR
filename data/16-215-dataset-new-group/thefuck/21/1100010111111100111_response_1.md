Based on the information provided, the buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash by examining the script and stderr properties of the `command` object. The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 8, which corresponds to the expression `command.script.split()[1]`. This means that the `split()` method failed to create a list with at least two elements, leading to the error. 

The most likely cause of this bug is that the script does not contain any additional parameters after the initial 'git' command. This is evident in the failing test, where the `script` property of the `command` object is simply 'git'. 

To fix this bug, we need to first ensure that the `command.script` is actually a list of strings before checking its second element. If the script is only 'git', the function should return False.

Based on this assessment, here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if not 'stash' in command.script:
        return False
    return 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This correction addresses the issue by first checking if 'stash' is present in the command script, and if so, it then proceeds to verify the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr. This should resolve the IndexError in the original buggy function.
