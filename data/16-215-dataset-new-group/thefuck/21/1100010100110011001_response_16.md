The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the `command` is related to a git stash error by checking if the second word in the `command.script` is "stash" and if "usage:" is in the `command.stderr`. 

### Potential error locations:
1. The `command` may not have enough items when splitting `command.script`.
2. The `command.stderr` may not contain the expected error message.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by an IndexError when trying to access the second word in `command.script` if the list index is out of range.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the length of the `command.script` list before accessing the second word to prevent the IndexError.
2. Confirm that the `command.stderr` contains the expected error message before checking for its presence.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 
            and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
