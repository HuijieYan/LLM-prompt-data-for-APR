The buggy function is a part of a Python script, which is likely a part of a larger system for fixing git-related errors.

The potential error in the buggy function is the direct split of the `command.script` without checking for the length of the split list, which could lead to an `IndexError` if the command is not long enough.

The buggy function appears to be trying to match git commands where the first argument is 'stash' and the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the function does not check if the `command.script` actually contains more than one word before trying to access the second word.

To fix this bug, the function should first split the command and then access the second word only if the split results in multiple words.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
