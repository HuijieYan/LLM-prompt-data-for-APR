## Analysis
The buggy function is used to check if the provided command is a Git `stash` command and if the usage message is present in the stderr. However, the bug is causing an `IndexError` because the function assumes that the command script will always contain at least two elements, which is not the case when the command is just `git` without any additional parameters.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script.split()` will always have at least two elements, which is not true when the script contains only `git`. This causes the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If the command is just `git`, then we should return `False` directly.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected function should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
