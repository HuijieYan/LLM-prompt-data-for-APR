## The buggy function analysis
The buggy function is the `match` function defined in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. It checks whether a git command is equivalent to "git stash" and the command's stderr contains the text 'usage:'.

## Identify potential error locations
The potential error locations within the `match` function are:
1. `command.script.split()[1]` could cause an IndexError if the `command.script` doesn't contain a second word.
2. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is not robust and may lead to errors.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` will always contain at least 2 words. When the `command.script` is just "git", the split function returns a list with only one element, resulting in a list index out of range IndexError.

## Suggested bug-fix strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to first check if the `command.script` has at least 2 words. Then, perform the comparison with "stash" only if `command.script` contains more than one word. This will prevent the IndexError and make the function more robust.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
