Based on the provided information, the buggy function is failing because it is trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if the list actually contains more than one element. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the list has sufficient elements before trying to access them.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses this issue:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if the `command.script.split()` list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring before, and should result in the function passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values.

By making this correction, the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved as well.
