The cause of the bug is an IndexError occurring in the buggy function when accessing the split command. This error happens because the script.split() function is trying to access the second element of the split list, assuming that it exists. However, in this case, the split list containing the command script is only one element long, leading to an index out of range error.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split list contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If the split list contains less than two elements, we can safely assume that the command does not match and return False.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) > 1
        and split_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

With this correction, the function checks if the split_script contains more than one element before trying to access the second one. This prevents the IndexError and allows the function to correctly evaluate whether the command matches the condition.
