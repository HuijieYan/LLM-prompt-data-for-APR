## Explanation
The `match` function attempts to access the second element of the command script after splitting it and then checks if it equals 'stash'. However, the failing test does not provide any script for the command, resulting in an IndexError because there are no elements in the split list.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to handle the case where the command script is empty or has no elements after splitting.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split() if command.script else []
    return len(script) >= 2 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
