The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. If both conditions are met, it returns True. However, the bug occurs because if the `command.script` does not contain a second word, it will cause a `IndexError` when trying to split the script.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before accessing the second word. We also need to ensure that we are checking for the correct conditions as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
