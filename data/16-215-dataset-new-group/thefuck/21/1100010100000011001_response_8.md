### Analysis
The buggy function is using the split() function on command.script to check if the second word is 'stash'. It also checks if the command.stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, if the second word in the command.script is 'stash' and 'usage:' is found in the command.stderr, the function will return True. 

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is returning True if the second word in the command.script is 'stash' and 'usage:' is found in the command.stderr. This is not the correct condition to determine if the command matches. The function should only return True if the command is trying to use the 'git stash' command and the command execution failed.

### Bug Fix
Use the `startswith` method to check if the command starts with 'git stash' and check if `command.returncode != 0` to ensure that the command execution failed.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and command.returncode != 0)
```
