## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition `command.script.split()[1]` is trying to access the second element of the split list, which may not exist if the `command.script` does not have any content after the command itself.
2. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` may also cause an error if the split list does not contain a second element.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the fact that the function `command.script.split()[1]` tries to access the second element of the split list, but when the `command.script` is just `"git"`, the split list will only contain one element and trying to access the second element leads to an `IndexError`.

## Bug-fixing strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to first check if the split list contains at least the second element before accessing it. Additionally, a check should be added to ensure that the command is actually "stash".

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
