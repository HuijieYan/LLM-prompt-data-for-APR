### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to return True if the command is a git stash command and the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is failing with an IndexError, indicating that it is trying to access an index in a list that doesn't exist. This suggests that `command.script` is not being split correctly.

### Bug Identification
The bug is likely in the line `command.script.split()[1]` where it is trying to access index 1 without checking if the split resulted in at least 2 elements.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is failing because it assumes that `command.script` will always have at least two parts after splitting, and doesn't handle the case when it doesn't.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split result has at least 2 elements before trying to access index 1. If not, we can return False as it means the command is not a valid git stash command.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
