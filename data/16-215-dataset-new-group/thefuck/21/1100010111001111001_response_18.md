To fix the bug, we need to adjust the buggy function to correctly determine whether the command is related to a git stash operation. We can do this by checking if the command starts with "git stash" and if the word "usage:" is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly identify whether the command is related to a git stash operation, and the failing test case should pass.
