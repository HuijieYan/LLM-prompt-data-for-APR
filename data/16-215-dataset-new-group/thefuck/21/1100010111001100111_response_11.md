The bug in the `match` function is that it tries to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if there is a second element. This causes the `IndexError: list index out of range` when the script is just "git".

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding the `len(split_script) > 1` check before accessing `split_script[1]`, we ensure that the issue with a single-element split list is handled properly.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
