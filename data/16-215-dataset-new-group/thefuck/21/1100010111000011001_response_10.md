### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is expected to return True if the second word in the `command.script` is "stash" and if the command's `stderr` contains the substring "usage:". However, the implementation does not check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This can lead to an `IndexError` if the `split` operation doesn't produce enough elements.

### Bug
The `match` function does not handle cases where the `command.script` does not contain at least two words, leading to an `IndexError`. This causes the failing test as it doesn't account for this error condition.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the function should first check if the split operation on `command.script` produces enough elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, it should check if "stash" is the second word and if "usage:" is in the `command.stderr`. 

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and
            script_words[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
