The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the input command is related to git and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". The function is buggy because it directly checks for the second word of the input command's script without verifying if the script actually has that many words, leading to the `IndexError` when `split()[1]` is accessed. 

The strategy to fix the bug is to check if the command contains the word "stash" and if the stderr contains "usage:". Then, perform a split on the input command's script only if it is not empty, and then check if the second word is "stash". If the length of the split script is less than 2, it means the script doesn't have a second word and the function should return False.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        script_words = command.script.split()
        if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
            return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub about the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just "git".
