### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
- The condition `command.script.split()[1]` might cause an `IndexError` if the script is just "git" without any additional arguments.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function tries to access the second element of the split command script, which leads to an `IndexError` when the script contains just "git" without any additional arguments. This causes the function to fail, resulting in a failing test and a corresponding error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the code should first check if the split command script has enough elements before accessing the second element, to avoid an `IndexError`.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
