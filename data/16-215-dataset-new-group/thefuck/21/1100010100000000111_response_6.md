The buggy function is the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function is supposed to match a specific pattern in the command and its stderr output. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just "git".

The potential error in the buggy function is that it is checking for the presence of the word "stash" at the second position of the command script without checking if it is a valid git command.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the command script will always have "stash" at the second position, leading to an `IndexError` when it is not present.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the script is a valid git command before attempting to access its elements. This can be achieved by checking if the first word is "git" in the command script.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[0] == 'git'
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if the command script has at least two parts and if the first part is "git" before checking for the presence of "stash" at the second position. This will prevent the `IndexError` and ensure that the function only matches valid "git stash" commands.
