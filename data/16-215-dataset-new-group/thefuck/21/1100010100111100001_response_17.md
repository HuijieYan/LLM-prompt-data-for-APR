The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr of the command contains the word 'usage:'. However, the bug is caused by the assumption that the command.script can be split into multiple parts. This assumption leads to an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split command.script.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command contains the keyword 'stash', and then check if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly check if the command is related to git stash and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr, addressing the bug and passing the failing test.
