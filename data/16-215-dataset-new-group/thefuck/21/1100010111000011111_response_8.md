The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the usage help message is included in the stderr. However, there is an issue with the implementation that leads to an IndexError when the script is just 'git' instead of 'git stash'. This causes the failing test where the script is just 'git' and the stderr includes the usage help message.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the command script is longer than 1 before trying to access the second element. If the length is greater than 1, we can then check if the second element is 'stash'.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
This corrected version should now pass the failing test, as well as satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
