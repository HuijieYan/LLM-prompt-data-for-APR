The bug occurs in the `git_fix_stash` rule when the `git` command is used without any arguments. This causes the `command.script.split()` to only return a list with one element, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element (index 1).

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) >= 2
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the split command, we ensure that we only access the second element when it exists, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring. This correction should address the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
