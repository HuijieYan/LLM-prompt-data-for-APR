The buggy function is supposed to check if the command's script contains 'git stash' and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string. However, the bug occurs when the script is just 'git' which leads to an 'IndexError: list index out of range' because it tries to access the second element in the split script, which does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two words and then perform the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
