The buggy function is the `match` function from the `git_fix_stash.py` file, which is part of the `thefuck` tool. The function is supposed to identify if a Git command is trying to use the `stash` feature by checking if the second word in the script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is present in the command's stderr.

The GitHub issue describes that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just `git`, and it provides a traceback showing an `IndexError: list index out of range`. This traceback suggests that the `match` function is trying to access the second word in the script without verifying if there are actually enough words in the script.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `match` function to first check if the command has at least two words to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking if the length of `script_words` is greater than 1 before accessing `script_words[1]`, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the script contains fewer than two words. This should fix the bug and address the issue posted on GitHub.
