The buggy function is supposed to match `git stash` commands that produce an error message with the word "usage:" in the stderr. However, the bug causes an error to occur when trying to split the script by spaces due to an IndexError.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes that the script will always have at least two elements when split by spaces. However, in this case, the script is "git" and does not contain a second element, leading to the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected function first checks if the command script has at least two elements before accessing the second element. If it does, then it checks if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. This fix should resolve the IndexError and ensure that the function works as intended.
