To fix the buggy function, it is important to understand the root cause of the bug. The function is trying to match a command that starts with "git stash" and has the string "usage:" in the stderr. However, the bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the command script does not contain enough words to split into an array.

The potential error location is the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` because it assumes there will always be at least two words in `command.script`, which is not always the case.

The bug is caused by the failing test because the test command is "git" and the stderr is set to git_stash_err. The function interprets this as `command.script.split()[1]` needing to be compared to 'stash', which causes an IndexError as `split()` does not produce enough elements to index.

I suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to add a condition before the comparison to check if `command.script` can be split into at least two elements before continuing with the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
