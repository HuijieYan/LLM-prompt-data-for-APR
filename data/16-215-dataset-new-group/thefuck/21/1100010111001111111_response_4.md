The bug in the `match` function is caused by assuming the presence of the second element in the split of `command.script`. This is due to the expression `command.script.split()[1]`. When the `command.script` is just `'git'`, it does not contain a second element after splitting. This is what leads to the "IndexError: list index out of range".

To fix this bug, add a check to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This code first splits the `command.script` and then checks if the result has at least two elements before comparing the second element with `'stash'`. This fix will prevent the "IndexError" from occurring and will make the `match` function work as expected.
