The bug in the provided code is likely due to the assumption that the `command.script` can be split and accessed by index. However, in the failing test, the `command.script` is just 'git', and splitting it by space will result in a list with only one element. Accessing the index 1 of this list will cause an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the `command.script` has at least two parts before trying to access the second part. This will prevent the IndexError that was previously occurring. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
