The buggy function `match` fails the test case `test_not_match`. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError: list index out of range` on line 8 of the buggy function (`git_fix_stash.py`). This error occurs because the `command.script` is just `'git'`, so when trying to split it by whitespace and access index 1, it results in an out of range index.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case where `command.script` does not contain enough parameters after splitting.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from thefuck.types import Command
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    if len(script_split) > 1:
        return (script_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

With this correction, the function now checks if there are at least two elements when splitting `command.script`. If there are, it continues with the comparison; otherwise, it returns `False` immediately.

This version of the function should pass the failing test and the provided input/output values, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
