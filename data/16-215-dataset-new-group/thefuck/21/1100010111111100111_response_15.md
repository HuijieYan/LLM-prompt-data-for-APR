The bug in the `match` function is that it assumes there will always be a second element in `command.script.split()`. However, in the failing test, the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, so when the split is performed, there is only one element in the list. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, the function should first check that the length of the split result is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will check the length of the split result before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.
