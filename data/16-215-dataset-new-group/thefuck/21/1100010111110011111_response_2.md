## Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the script's second word is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, the failing test is using a command script that has only the word 'git', and it expects the function not to match.

The buggy function fails to check for the length of the split script, causing an index error when trying to access the second word.

## Potential Error Locations
The buggy function uses `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if `command.script` has at least two words.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not handling the case where the command script might not contain the expected number of words. The failing test reflects this as it provides a command script with only one word ('git') and expects the function not to match. The resulting index error occurs as the function tries to access the second word in the split script.

## Fixing the Bug
A check should be added to ensure that `command.script` has at least two words before accessing the second word in the split script.

## The Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
