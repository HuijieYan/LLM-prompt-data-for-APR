The buggy function, `match`, currently splits `command.script` by spaces and checks if the second element is "stash". However, the failing test has `command.script` equal to "git" and `command.stderr` includes the usage message for the "stash" command.

The bug is caused by the assumption that `command.script` always contains the command to be matched, in this case "stash", when it doesn't.

To fix the bug, we should check if "stash" is in `command.stderr` instead of splitting `command.script`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'usage: git stash' in command.stderr
```
