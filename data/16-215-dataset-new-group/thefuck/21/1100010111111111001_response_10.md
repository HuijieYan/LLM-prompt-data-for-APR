The buggy function `match` is supposed to detect whether a Git command is related to stashing. It checks if the second word in the command is "stash" and if the command's stderr contains "usage:". The bug occurs when the split function is called on `command.script` and it only contains one word, causing an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command's script contains at least two words before accessing the second word. We can also directly check if the command's script starts with "git stash" to handle the specific case of stash commands.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[0] == 'git' and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check that the command's script contains at least two words before accessing the second word, preventing the IndexError. Then it checks if the first word is "git" and the second word is "stash". This ensures that the function accurately identifies git stash commands and checks the stderr for "usage:", as intended.
