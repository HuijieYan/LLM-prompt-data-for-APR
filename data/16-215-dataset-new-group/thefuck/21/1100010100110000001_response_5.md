The buggy function is attempting to match a git command with the word "stash" in the script and the word "usage:" in the command's stderr. However, the error message suggests an "IndexError: list index out of range", which means the split() method is trying to access a list index that doesn't exist.

The bug is caused by the assumption that the command.script can be split into multiple parts and the second part will always be the sub-command (e.g., 'stash'). However, in this case, the split() method is likely failing to find a second part due to the absence of the sub-command in the git command.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split() method returns at least two parts before comparing the second part with 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function checks whether the split list has at least two parts, and if so, it compares the second part with 'stash'. This should resolve the IndexError issue.

After making this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
