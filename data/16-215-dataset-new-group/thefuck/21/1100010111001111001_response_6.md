The bug in the provided function is that it is checking for the presence of the entire `usage:` line in the `stderr` output, which might not always be present. Additionally, the function is incorrectly checking for the second word in the command script, when it should be checking for the second word after the `git` command.

The cause of the bug:
The function is improperly checking for the entire `usage:` line in the `stderr` output instead of just checking if the `stash` command is present in the `script`. Additionally, it is incorrectly checking for the second word in the command script.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check if the `stash` command is present in the `script` and then check for the relevant output in the `stderr` for correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check for the presence of the `stash` command in the `script` parameter and then validate the `stderr` output for the presence of the `usage:` line, passing the failing test.
