The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command script is for stashing in git and if the error message contains the string 'usage:'. However, it currently checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', which doesn't accurately capture the intention.

The cause of the bug is that the check for the second word in the command script is too restrictive and does not cover all possible command variations.

To fix the bug, the function should check if 'stash' is present in the command script and if 'usage:' is present in the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
