The buggy function has a problem with the comparison in the return statement, where it checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This comparison may not correctly identify the command as a git stash command.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison in the return statement is not accurately checking the required conditions for a git stash command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement to accurately check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now accurately identify whether the command is a git stash command based on the script and stderr, and the failing test should pass.
