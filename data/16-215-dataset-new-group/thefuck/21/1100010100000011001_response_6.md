### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if the command stderr contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the 'stash' or 'usage:' occurs at different positions within the script or stderr.

### Bug
The current implementation only checks if 'stash' is the second word in the script and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. This is too strict and may cause the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the presence of 'stash' and 'usage:' anywhere in the script and stderr, respectively. This can be achieved using the `in` operator.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
