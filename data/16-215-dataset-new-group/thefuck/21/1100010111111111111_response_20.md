The bug in the `match` function is caused by the attempt to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list, which causes an IndexError because the list may not necessarily have a second element. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split command produces at least two elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if the split command produces at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This will prevent the IndexError and resolve the failing test case.
