The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command involves `git stash` and if the stderr of the command contains `'usage:'`. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError: list index out of range` at line 8, which suggests that the `command.script` does not contain the expected number of elements when split.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function assumes the `command.script` will contain at least two elements when split, but this assumption is not always true. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to first check the length of the split command script to ensure it has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
