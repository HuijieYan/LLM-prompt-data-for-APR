### Error Analysis
The error message indicates that the buggy function is causing an `IndexError` on the line `command.script.split()[1]` when trying to access the second element of the split command. This error occurs when the script is just "git", which does not have a second element. Based on the expected input values, the buggy function is supposed to return `False` in this case, but it is raising an error instead.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function attempts to split the command script and access the second element without first checking if the split resulted in enough elements. This results in an `IndexError` when the script is "git" since it's a single-element list. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split result contains more than one element before trying to access the second element.

### Corrected Code
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function checks if the split command script contains more than one element before proceeding with the comparison and returns `False` if it does not. This should resolve the `IndexError` and allow the function to return the expected value when the script is just "git".
