## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if 'usage:' is in the command's standard error. The failing test is checking if the command script is "git" and if the standard error contains the correct string. The function fails to handle the case where the command script is "git" and doesn't properly split the script to retrieve the second word, leading to an IndexError when accessing the non-existent index in the split result.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function blindly assumes that the second word from the script always exists, leading to an IndexError when it doesn't. In this case, the command script is "git" and the function incorrectly tries to access the second word in the split list, which doesn't exist.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function should first check if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second word. If the length is less than 2, the function should return False. Additionally, the function should also check for the presence of 'usage:' in the command's standard error to determine if it's a match.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(script_parts) >= 2 
        and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```
