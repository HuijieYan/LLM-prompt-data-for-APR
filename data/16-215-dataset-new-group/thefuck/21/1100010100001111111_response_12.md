The function is supposed to check if the git command is for stashing, by checking if the second word in the command is 'stash'. However, the code is failing because it's assuming the command will always be at least two words, which is not the case when the command is just 'git'.

To fix this, we need to first check if the script is 'git', and then check if the second word is 'stash'. If the script is not 'git', or if there are less than two words in the command, then we should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[0] == 'git':
        return split_script[1] == 'stash'
    
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will now check if the command is 'git stash' and return True in that case, and return False for any other command. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
