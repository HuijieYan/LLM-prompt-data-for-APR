The buggy function `match` checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the error output. The issue on GitHub indicates that the rule fails when the command is just 'git' without any additional arguments.

The error in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the command contains only one word, which causes the `command.script.split()` to return a list with only one element, leading to the 'IndexError: list index out of range'.

To fix this bug, we can check the length of the split command and also handle the case where the command is just 'git'. If the length is greater than 1, we can perform the existing check. If it's not, we can directly return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This fixed version of the function checks the length of the split command before attempting to access its elements and handles the case where the command is just 'git' by returning False.
