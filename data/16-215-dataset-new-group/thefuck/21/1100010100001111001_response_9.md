## Fixing the bug

The buggy function is currently checking if the second word in the input command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, it's not taking into account the potential presence of line breaks in the stderr, which could cause the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we should split the stderr by lines and check for the presence of 'usage:' in each line.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'stash' in command.script.split()
            and any('usage:' in line for line in command.stderr.split('\n')))
```
