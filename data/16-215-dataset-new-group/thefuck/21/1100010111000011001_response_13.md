### Buggy Function Analysis
 
The buggy function `match` checks whether the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The bug may exist in the conditional statement that checks for the presence of 'stash' and 'usage:' in the command and its stderr.

### Identifying the Bug
The bug in the function is likely due to the use of `command.script.split()[1]` to check for the command and ignoring the possibility that the command might have additional arguments.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function uses `command.script.split()[1]` to extract the second word from the command, assuming it is 'stash' when in fact, the second word could be any argument after 'git', such as 'stash'. This causes the function to fail to match the correct case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check the command against 'git stash' and verify the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
