## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the error message contains the word "usage:". 
The failing test is trying to assert that the buggy function should not match a specific command but the error message indicates an IndexError which means the command.script.split() is resulting in an empty list, leading to an index out of range error.

## Identification of Potential Error Locations
- The line `command.script.split()[1]` can result in an IndexError if the `script` is empty or contains only one element.
- The code is only checking if the command has a single word, but it should be checking if the first word is "git" and the second word is "stash".

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug is caused because the buggy function is not handling the case when the command.script is empty or contains only one element. This results in an empty list after split() is called on it, and therefore, attempting to access the second element of the list causes an IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by checking if the `command.script` starts with "git stash" and if the error message contains "usage:". This will ensure that the split() function doesn't throw an IndexError.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
