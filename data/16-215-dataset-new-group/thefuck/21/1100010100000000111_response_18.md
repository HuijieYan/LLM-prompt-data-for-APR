The buggy function is the `match` function in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function is supposed to check if the git command is related to the 'stash' subcommand and if the usage information is available in the stderr. However, the bug causes an IndexError when the script is just 'git' without any additional subcommands.

The bug is caused by the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` when the script is just 'git', `command.script.split()` will return a list with only one element ('git'), and trying to access the second element with index 1 will result in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should first check for the length of the split command and then access the second element if it exists. If the split command has a length of 2, we can then check if the second element is 'stash'. If the length is less than 2, we can assume it is not related to the stash command and return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) >= 2:
        return split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```
