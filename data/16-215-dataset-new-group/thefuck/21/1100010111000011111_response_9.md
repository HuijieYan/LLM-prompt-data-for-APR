The buggy function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py` is designed to check if the command being passed is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". However, there is an error in the function causing it to fail.

The problem occurs when the `command.script` is just "git". The function attempts to split the script by whitespace and access the second element, causing an `IndexError` when the script does not contain any whitespace.

To fix this bug, the function needs to first check that the length of `command.script` is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
