The buggy function is supposed to match the command with 'git stash' and check if the error message includes 'usage:'. However, the bug is caused by the function assuming that the command.script.split() will always have at least two elements, which leads to an IndexError when accessing the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains 'git stash' and then check if the error message includes 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by explicitly checking for the presence of 'stash' in the command.script and 'usage:' in the command.stderr, without relying on the split() function.

With this correction, the failing test should pass successfully.
