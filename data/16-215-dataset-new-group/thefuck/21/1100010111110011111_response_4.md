### Analysis
The buggy function is a decorator named `git_support` applied to the `match` function. The `match` function checks if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the stderr includes the word "usage:". The failing test is checking if the buggy function does not match when the stderr includes the word "usage:".

### Potential error locations
1. The `command.script.split()[1]` may raise an `IndexError` if the `split()` method doesn't create a list with at least two items.
2. The comparison with the string "stash" might raise an error if there are any differences in the case (uppercase/lowercase).

### Cause of the bug
The failing test is triggering an error with the buggy function, causing an `IndexError` due to the attempt to access the second element of the split command.script when there's only one element. This error occurs because the `split()` method was called prior to checking the length of the resulting list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, it's necessary to check if the split method creates a list with at least two items before attempting to access the second item. Additionally, it would be wise to convert all comparisons to lowercase to avoid issues with case sensitivity.

### Corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_split) > 1 
            and command_split[1].lower() == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower())
```
