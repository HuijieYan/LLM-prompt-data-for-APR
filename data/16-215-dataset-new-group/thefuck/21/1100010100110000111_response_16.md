The buggy function is the `match` function from the `git_fix_stash` rule. The function expects a command with the script containing 'git stash' and the stderr containing 'usage:', and it returns True if both conditions are met. However, the error occurs when the script is just 'git' without any additional arguments, and this causes an IndexError when trying to access the list of split script.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the script contains at least two elements before accessing the second index of the split script.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
