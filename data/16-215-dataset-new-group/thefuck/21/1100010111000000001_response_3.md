## Analysis:
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the git command is related to stashing and if the stderr contains the phrase "usage:". However, it seems that the current implementation is not correctly identifying the command and is failing the test.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` might not be correctly identifying the git stash command.
2. The condition `and 'usage:' in command.stderr` might not be correctly checking the stderr for the phrase "usage:".

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect identification of the git stash command and the incorrect check for the phrase "usage:" in the stderr. This causes the `match` function to return `False` when it should return `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a more robust method to identify the git stash command in the `command.script`.
2. Use a more reliable method to check if the "usage:" phrase exists in the `command.stderr`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
