The issue with the existing code is that it assumes the command contains at least two elements when splitting the script, which may not always be the case. This leads to the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the command contains at least two elements before accessing the second element of the split script. If not, we can return False. Additionally, we can also check if the second element is "stash" and if "usage:" is in the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of at least two elements in the command's script before accessing the second element. If there are not enough elements, it returns False. If there are enough elements, it proceeds to check if the second element is "stash" and if "usage:" is in the command's stderr. This should address the IndexError and correctly identify whether the command matches the conditions.
