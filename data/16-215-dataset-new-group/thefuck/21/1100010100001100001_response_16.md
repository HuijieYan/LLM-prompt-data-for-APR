The buggy function checks if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the stderr. However, in the provided case, the script is 'git' and the second word is not 'stash', so the function should return False. 

The buggy function does not account for the possibility of additional words after 'git'. To fix the bug, we can modify the function to split the command.script and check the second word for 'stash', and also include a check for 'usage:' in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in splitted_script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
