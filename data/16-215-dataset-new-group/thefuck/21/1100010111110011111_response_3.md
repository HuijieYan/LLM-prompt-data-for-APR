The buggy function `match` is intended to determine whether a given command matches a git stash usage error. The function currently splits the command script at spaces and checks if the second element is 'stash', and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr.

The cause of the bug is the assumption that the command script will always have at least two elements after splitting by spaces. 

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the command script has at least two elements after splitting, to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version includes a check to see if the split command script has at least two elements. If it does, it checks the second element and the stderr to determine if the command matches a git stash usage error. If it doesn't have at least two elements, the function returns False, as it does not match the expected pattern for a git command related to stash.
