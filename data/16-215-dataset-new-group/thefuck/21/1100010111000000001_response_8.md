## Analysis
The buggy function `match()` is designed to check if a git command is related to stashing changes and if the command has a usage error. However, the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'stash' in the command and 'usage:' in the stderr, which is not sufficient.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is the `return` statement inside the `match()` function. It only checks for specific strings in the command script and stderr, which can lead to false positives.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the limited condition check in the `match()` function, leading to false positives or negatives for commands related to stashing changes.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
A better strategy would be to parse the git command and check the actual functionality being used and the specific error message, rather than relying on hardcoded string checks.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
In the corrected version, we are checking the second part of the command (assuming it is the subcommand) for 'stash' and also verifying if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This approach provides a more accurate check for commands related to stashing changes.
