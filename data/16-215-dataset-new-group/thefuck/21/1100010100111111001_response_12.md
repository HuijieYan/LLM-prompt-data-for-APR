The buggy function is attempting to compare the second word in the command script with 'stash', and check if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, the buggy function is failing when the command script does not have a second word or when the word 'stash' is not the second word in the script.

The cause of the bug is an IndexError, which occurs when the script does not have a second word and the function attempts to access that index in the split list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. Additionally, we should check if the word 'stash' is in the split list before attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has at least two elements and then compare the second element with 'stash'. Then, it will check if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.
