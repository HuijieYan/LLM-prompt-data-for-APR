The buggy function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py` is supposed to check if the `git` command is related to stashing changes and if the command stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is causing an `IndexError` because it assumes that the `command.script` contains at least two elements when splitting, which is not always the case. 

The failing test `test_not_match` is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` given a specific `git` command stderr related to stashing changes. However, the buggy function is raising an `IndexError` instead.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the `command.script` contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
