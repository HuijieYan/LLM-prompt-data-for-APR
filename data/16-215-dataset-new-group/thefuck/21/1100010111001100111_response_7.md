### Explanation
The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` string and compare the second element to 'stash', which will cause an `IndexError` because the list is empty, resulting in list index out of range.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should first check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before comparing the second element to 'stash'.

### The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
