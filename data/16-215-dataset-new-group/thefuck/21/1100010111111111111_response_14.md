The buggy function is designed to match a specific condition, checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the command's standard error. The failing test 'test_not_match' is failing because the script defined in the command is 'git', and the function tries to split it by spaces, resulting in a list with only one element. When trying to access the second element of this list to compare with 'stash', an IndexError occurs.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the script contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the script contains more than one word, and then it will proceed to check if the second word is 'stash' and if the 'usage:' string is in the command's standard error.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the GitHub issue posted regarding this bug.
