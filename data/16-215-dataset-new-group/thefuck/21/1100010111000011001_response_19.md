### Analyzing the buggy function and test
The `match` function is designed to return whether a command is a Git `stash` command and the `usage:` string is in the stderr. The failing test is checking if the function does not match a specific command.

### Potential error locations
1. The comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` may fail if `command.script` does not contain at least two words.
2. The check for `'usage:' in command.stderr` may not accurately determine if the `usage:` string is present in the stderr.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function is not checking the command's script and stderr in a robust way. It fails in the presence of real-world input when the script does not contain at least two words, or the text is not correctly present in the error message.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if the command script actually contains the Git `stash` keyword before attempting to access the second word.
2. Use a more reliable method to check if the `usage:` string is present in the stderr.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
