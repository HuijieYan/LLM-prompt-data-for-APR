The bug is caused by the assumption that the `command.script` will always have at least one element when split, which is not the case when the script is just "git". This causes the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command.script` can be split before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of the split `script_parts`, we ensure that we don't encounter an `IndexError` when trying to access its elements. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted in GitHub by handling the case when the script is just "git".
