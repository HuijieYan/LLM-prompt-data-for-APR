## Explanation
The issue on GitHub is related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just "git". The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the buggy function is trying to access an index of a list that does not exist, which causes the error.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location within the buggy function is the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The error occurs because the `command.script.split()` may not always have an index of 1, especially for the "git" command as described in the GitHub issue.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the script is just "git" and there is no valid index in the split command. We need to check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before comparing with 'stash'.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
