The bug in the function `match` is causing the test `test_not_match` to fail. The error message indicates that the bug is causing an `IndexError` because the script is empty.

The cause of the bug is that the function splits the command script on spaces and then tries to access the 2nd element of the resulting list without checking if that element exists. This leads to an `IndexError` when the script does not have any spaces to split.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the script contains enough elements to access the 2nd element before comparing it to 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This version of the function first splits the script into parts, and then checks if there are enough parts to access the 2nd element. If there are, it compares it to 'stash', and also checks if 'usage:' is in the error message. If there aren't enough parts, it returns False. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
