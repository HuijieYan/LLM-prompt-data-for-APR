The buggy function is attempting to match a git command that includes the word "stash" and also includes the string "usage:" in the stderr. The error message indicates that there is an IndexError, specifically "IndexError: list index out of range", which means that the program is trying to access an index in a list that is out of range.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line "command.script.split()[1]", as it is attempting to access the second element of the split command.script without checking if it exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes that the git command will always contain at least two words when split by spaces, which may not be the case. This causes an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split command.script.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if the split command.script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this correction, the function checks if there are at least two elements in the split command.script before attempting to access the second element. If there aren't enough elements, it returns False. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring and fix the bug.
