The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' message. The error message indicates an IndexError, which means that the script.split()[1] is causing the issue.

The issue lies in the fact that the `split()` method is being called without specifying a delimiter, which means it's splitting the string by whitespace. If the command.script is just 'git', then accessing the index 1 of the resulting list will cause an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the split() method to split the string based on whitespace or any other delimiter and then check for the second element.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will split the command script by whitespace and check if the first element is 'git', and also check if the 'usage:' message is in the stderr. This should resolve the IndexError issue.
