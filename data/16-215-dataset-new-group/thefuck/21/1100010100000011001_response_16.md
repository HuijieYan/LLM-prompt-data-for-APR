### Analysis
The buggy function receives a `command` object as a parameter, which has a `script` attribute representing the command that was run, and a `stderr` attribute representing the standard error output of the command. The function is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the current implementation may fail if the script does not have a second word, or if the stderr is not in lowercase.

### Bug Cause
The current implementation uses `split()[1]` to access the second word of the command script, which may lead to an "IndexError" if a second word does not exist. Additionally, the comparison with 'usage:' does not take into account the case sensitivity of the stderr.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to modify the code to handle cases where there might not be a second word in the command script, and also ensure that we perform a case-insensitive check for 'usage:' in the stderr.

### The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr.lower())
```
