## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message
The buggy function is a decorator called `git_support`, which is being used to wrap the `match` function. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` occurring within the `match` function. The `IndexError` is happening at the line `command.script.split()[1]`, indicating that the split operation is trying to access an index that is out of range.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error is happening at `command.script.split()[1]`.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message
The cause of the bug is that the `command.script.split()` operation is not returning a list with at least two elements, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split operation is returning a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

## Provide a corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) > 1 and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
In the corrected version, `command.script.split()` is stored in a variable `command_parts`, and then it is checked if `len(command_parts) > 1` before accessing the second element. This ensures that the split operation returns a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This should fix the `IndexError` issue.
