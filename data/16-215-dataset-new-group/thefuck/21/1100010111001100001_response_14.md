The potential error in the buggy function is that the comparison `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is not checking if the command script contains the word 'stash' at all. Instead, it is checking if the second word in the script is 'stash', which may not always be the case.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is checking for the word 'stash' only at a specific index in the command script, which may not be accurate.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' anywhere.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the command script contains the word 'stash', and the failing test should pass.
