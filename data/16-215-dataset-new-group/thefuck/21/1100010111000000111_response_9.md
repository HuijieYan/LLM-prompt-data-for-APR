The buggy function `match` seems to be checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr of the command.

The failing test `test_not_match` is expecting the `match` function to return False when the stderr contains `git_stash_err` and the command is 'git'.

The GitHub issue indicates that the bug causes an IndexError because the script does not contain enough words to split into a list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the script contains at least two words before attempting to access the second word in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_words` before accessing the second element, we can prevent the IndexError that was occurring. This should make the function pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
