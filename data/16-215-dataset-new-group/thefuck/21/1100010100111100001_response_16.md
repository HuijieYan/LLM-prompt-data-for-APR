## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match the `git stash` command when the usage is shown in the stderr. However, the bug is caused by assuming that the `git stash` command is always present in the script and trying to split it without checking. This assumption leads to an IndexError when accessing the second element of the splitted script.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains sufficient elements before trying to access the second element. If the script is split into less than two parts, it means that the command is not `git stash` and we should return False. Otherwise, we can proceed to check if 'usage:' exists in the command's stderr.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    else:
        return False
```
