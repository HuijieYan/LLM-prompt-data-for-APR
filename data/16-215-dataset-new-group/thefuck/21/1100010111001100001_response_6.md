The bug in the `match` function is that it only checks if the command script starts with `'git stash'` and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. This means that it won't match the command if there are any additional arguments or options after 'git stash'. The fix would be to check if the command starts with `'git stash'` instead of just checking the second word in the command script.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this change, the function will match any command that starts with 'git stash' and has 'usage:' in the stderr.

This should fix the failing test case.
