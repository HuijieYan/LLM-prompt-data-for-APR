The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is causing an `IndexError` when the `command.script.split()[1]` is accessed and `['stash']` is not found at the second index. This error occurs when the script is just `'git'`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the length of `command.script.split()` is less than 2, and return `False` in that case. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the `IndexError` will no longer occur when the script is just `'git'`. The function will return `False` in that case and avoid the error.
