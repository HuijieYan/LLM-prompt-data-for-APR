### Analysis
The buggy function takes a `command` as input, which is expected to have a `script` and `stderr` attribute. It checks if the second word in the `script` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `stderr`. However, there are no checks for the length of the split script, so it may throw an IndexError if the script doesn't have a second word.

### Bug
The bug is caused by not checking the length of the split script before comparing the second word. This can cause an IndexError if the script doesn't have a second word.

### Fix
We can fix the bug by checking the length of the split script and then comparing the second word.

### The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
