The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to "git stash" and if the stderr contains the string "usage:". However, the buggy implementation is causing an IndexError because it is trying to access the second element of the split command, assuming it exists.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if the length of the split command is at least 2 before accessing the second element. This will prevent the IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will check the length of the split command before trying to access the second element, preventing the IndexError.
