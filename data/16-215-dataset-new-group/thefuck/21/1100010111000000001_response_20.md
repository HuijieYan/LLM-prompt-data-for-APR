The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to Git and if the stderr contains the word "stash". However, the current implementation just checks for the word "stash" in the command script, and also checks for the presence of "usage:" in the command stderr. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` may fail if the command script is not formatted as expected.
2. The condition `'usage:' in command.stderr` may fail if the expected error message does not include "usage:".

The cause of the bug is that the function only checks for the presence of specific words in the command and stderr, which may not be sufficient to accurately identify the command as a "stash" related command. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to perform a more comprehensive check on the command and stderr, and also handle cases where the expected words may not be in the exact positions within the command and stderr.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'stash' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

With this corrected implementation, the function checks if the command script contains "stash" in the expected position (script_parts[1]), and also checks if "stash" is present in the stderr. This should provide a more reliable check for identifying stash related commands.
