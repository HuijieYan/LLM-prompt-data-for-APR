## Fixing the bug
The bug in the `match` function is that it is checking for the presence of the string 'usage:' in the `command.stderr` to determine a match. However, the provided command.stderr contains the 'usage:' string, resulting in a false positive match.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition for a match to something that accurately reflects the expected behavior of the function.

One potential strategy to fix this bug is to check if the `command.script` contains the 'stash' command and if the `command.stderr` contains the string 'stash' as well. This will ensure that we are correctly identifying the 'stash' command in the stderr output.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'stash' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will check for the presence of the 'stash' command in both the `command.script` and `command.stderr`, providing a more accurate matching criteria.
