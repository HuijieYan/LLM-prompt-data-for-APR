The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the text 'usage:'. However, the current implementation has a bug because it directly checks if the second word in the command.script is 'stash', which could lead to an index out of range error if the script is just 'git'.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the command starts with 'git stash' and if the stderr contains the text 'usage:'. This will prevent the index out of range error and ensure the function behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the issue reported in GitHub related to the index out of range error.
