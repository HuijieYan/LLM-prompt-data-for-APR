The bug in the function `match` is causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command if the script only contains 'git' and does not contain a second element. This issue has been raised on GitHub with the title "git_fix_stash rule fails when script is just git".

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split command is enough to access the second element before trying to access it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, we first check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` that was occurring in the original function.
