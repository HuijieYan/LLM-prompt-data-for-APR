### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match a command that starts with "git stash" and has an error message containing "usage:". The error message indicates an IndexError, which suggests that the split() method on command.script is causing the problem.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by assuming that the input command script has at least two elements when split, which may not always be the case. This assumption leads to an IndexError when accessing the second element of the split result.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command script contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. We can also add a check for the presence of "usage:" in the stderr.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
