The buggy function `match` is checking if the first word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. However, in the failing test case, `command.script` is 'git' and this triggers an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list after splitting.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should first check if the `command.script` is 'git' before proceeding with the other checks.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if command.script.split()[0] == 'git':
        return 'stash' in command.stderr and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

With this fix, the function first checks if `command.script` is 'git'. If it is, then it proceeds to check if 'stash' is in the `command.stderr` and also if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `False`. This should resolve the issue and the failing test case.
