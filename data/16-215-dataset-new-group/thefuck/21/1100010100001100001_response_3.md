The buggy function is designed to check if the command script is for a Git stash operation and if the stderr contains the 'usage:' string. However, the current implementation does not properly handle multiple possible arguments. 

The bug in the current function is that it only checks for the presence of 'stash' as the second word in the command, and it does not account for the possibility of other arguments following 'stash'. Additionally, it only checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, but does not check if it appears at the beginning of the line.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle multiple arguments and to check if 'usage:' appears at the beginning of the line in the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (splited_script[0] == 'git' 
            and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and command.stderr.strip().startswith('usage:'))
```

In this corrected version, we split the command script into individual words and then check if the first word is 'git', the second word is 'stash', and if the stderr starts with 'usage:'. This properly handles multiple possible arguments and ensures that 'usage:' appears at the beginning of the line in the stderr.
