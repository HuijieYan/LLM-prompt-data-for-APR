### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is expected to return true if the command is a git stash command and the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the implementation does not check if the first word in the script is 'stash' but only compares it with the second word. This is likely causing the bug in the function.

### Bug identification
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the command script with 'stash'.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' instead of the first word. This causes it to fail when the input command is 'git stash' because the condition evaluates to false.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the first word in the command script is 'stash' and also if 'usage:' is in the command stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
