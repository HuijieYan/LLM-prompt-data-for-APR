The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is related to the git stash and if the error message contains "usage:". However, the current implementation is only checking if the second word in the command is "stash" and if "usage:" is in the error message. This implementation is incorrect as it does not cover all possible cases of git stash commands and their associated error messages.

To fix the bug, we need to check the entire script to see if it starts with "git stash" and also verify that "usage:" is in the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
