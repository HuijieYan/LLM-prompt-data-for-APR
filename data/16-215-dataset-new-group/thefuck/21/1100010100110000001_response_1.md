The buggy function is throwing an `IndexError` because it is trying to split the `command.script` and access the second element without checking if the splits actually occurred. This is happening in the line `command.script.split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are at least two elements in the split before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version checks if there are at least two parts after splitting the `command.script`, and then compares the second part with 'stash'. This should resolve the `IndexError` and the function will work as intended.
