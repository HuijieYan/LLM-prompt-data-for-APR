The buggy function `match` is designed to check if a git command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr of the command contains the text 'usage:'. The test function `test_not_match` is checking if the `match` function returns False when the stderr of the command does not contain 'usage:'.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` which assumes that the second word in the command is always 'stash'. This could cause an IndexError if the command does not contain a second word.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not handle the case where there is no second word in the command, leading to an IndexError when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command has at least two words before trying to access the second word. If the command is related to `git stash` and the stderr contains 'usage:', the function should return True, otherwise, it should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the command contains at least two words before comparing the second word to 'stash'. This should prevent any IndexError and resolve the bug.
