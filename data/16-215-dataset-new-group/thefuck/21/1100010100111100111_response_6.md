The buggy function `match` has an issue with the line `command.script.split()[1]`, which tries to access the second element of the list produced by splitting `command.script`. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the list does not have a second element, causing the index out of range error.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the list produced by splitting `command.script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function `match`:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we store the result of `command.script.split()` in `script_parts` and then check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before comparing `script_parts[1]` with `'stash'`. This ensures that we are not accessing an index out of range.
