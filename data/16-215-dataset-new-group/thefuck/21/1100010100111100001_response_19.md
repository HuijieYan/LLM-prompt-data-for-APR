The bug in the function is causing an IndexError because it is trying to split the command.script and access the second element without checking if it exists. 

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script has more than one element before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
