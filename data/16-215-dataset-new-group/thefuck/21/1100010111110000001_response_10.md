The buggy function `match` is failing with an `IndexError` because `command.script` is being split into a list, and then the second element is being checked for equality with 'stash'. However, if `command.script` does not have a second element, the `IndexError` will occur. The buggy function is trying to access an index that does not exist in `command.script`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` has at least two elements before we attempt to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
