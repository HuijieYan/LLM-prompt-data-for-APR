The bug in the `match` function arises from the assumption that `command.script` always contains at least two elements when split. However, in some cases, it may not be true, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` is splitting into at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If not, we should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By performing the above fix, we ensure that the `IndexError` will no longer occur when `command.script` does not contain at least two elements. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
