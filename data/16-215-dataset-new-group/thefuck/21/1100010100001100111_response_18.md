## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to match commands that involve using the git stash feature, specifically when the usage of the stash command is present in the stderr. However, the function fails to handle cases where the command script is just 'git', resulting in an IndexError when attempting to split the script.

The bug is caused by the assumption that the script split will always have at least 2 elements, resulting in an IndexError when the assumption is not met. The match function should be updated to handle cases where the split result may have fewer elements.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the match function should first check if the command script contains 'stash' and then verify the presence of 'usage:' in the command stderr. This will prevent the IndexError that arises when trying to access non-existent elements after splitting the command script.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, the script is split into parts before checking the length of the split result to ensure it has at least 2 elements. This prevents the IndexError and ensures that the match function works as intended.
