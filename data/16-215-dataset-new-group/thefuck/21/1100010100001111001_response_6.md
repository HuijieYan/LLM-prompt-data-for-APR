The buggy function is supposed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the usage message. However, the current implementation only checks the second word of the command.script and does not ensure that the stderr contains the expected message.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly checks only the second word of the command.script and does not verify the content of the stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script starts with "git stash" and if the stderr contains the "usage:" message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version checks if the command script starts with "git stash" using the `startswith` method and verifies that the stderr contains the "usage:" message. This should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
