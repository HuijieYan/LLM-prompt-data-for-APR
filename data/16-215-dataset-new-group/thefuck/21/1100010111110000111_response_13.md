The buggy function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is attempting to split the command script and check if the second part is equal to 'stash'. However, it is not handling the case where the command script does not contain any space-separated parts, leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `match` function to first check if the length of the split result is at least 2. If not, we should return False. Otherwise, we can proceed to check if the second part is equal to 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this updated logic, the `match` function will first verify that there are at least two parts of the split script before trying to access the second part and compare it with 'stash'. This change should fix the bug and make the function more robust.

This correction should resolve the `IndexError` and make the function pass the failing test.
