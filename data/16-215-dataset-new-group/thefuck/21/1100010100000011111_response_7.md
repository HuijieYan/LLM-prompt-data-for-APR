## Analysis
The function `match` is supposed to check if the command is for git stash and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is simply splitting the command script and checking if the second element is 'stash', which can cause an `IndexError` if the script is not long enough.

## Potential error locations
The potential error location is at `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`, where the `split()[1]` can cause an `IndexError` if the script is not long enough or doesn't contain the expected elements.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function does not handle corner cases where the command script might not be long enough to contain the desired elements. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element that doesn't exist.

## Bug-fix strategy
We need to modify the function to check if the split result is at least long enough to access the expected elements. If not, the function should return `False`.

## The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
