The bug in the function `match` occurs because it assumes that the `command.script` will contain at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, when the `command.script` is just "git", it results in an empty list after splitting, causing the IndexError. The expected error message, "IndexError: list index out of range", confirms this cause.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split list before accessing its elements to ensure that it contains the necessary elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This correction ensures that the `split_script` has at least two elements before trying to access the second element, preventing the IndexError.
