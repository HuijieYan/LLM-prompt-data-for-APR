The buggy function uses the `split()` method on `command.script` without checking if there are at least two elements in the resulting list. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list. 

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the `split()` method returns a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If the list doesn't have two elements, the function should return `False` to indicate that the command does not match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1 
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
