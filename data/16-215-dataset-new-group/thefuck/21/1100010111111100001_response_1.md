The buggy function is designed to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". However, the buggy function fails to handle cases where the command does not contain any argument after "git" and does not split the command script properly.

The bug is caused by the command.script.split()[1] statement, which assumes that the script contains at least two parts separated by a space. When the "git" command is called without any arguments, this statement results in a list index out of range error.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two parts before accessing the second part of the split. We can also improve the logic to check if the command is related to git stash and if the stderr contains the word "usage:" correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
With this correction, the updated function will check if the command is related to git stash only after ensuring that the script contains at least two parts. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
