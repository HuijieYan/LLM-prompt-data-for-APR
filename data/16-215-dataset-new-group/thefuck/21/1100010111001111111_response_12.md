The issue in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case when the length of `command.script.split()` is less than 2, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`. To fix this, the function needs to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
``` 

This version initializes a variable `script_split` to store the split script, then checks if its length is greater than 1 before proceeding with the rest of the conditions. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

By using this corrected version, the test case `test_not_match` should pass successfully, and it should satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix resolves the GitHub issue by handling the case where the script is just "git" and preventing the `IndexError` from happening.
