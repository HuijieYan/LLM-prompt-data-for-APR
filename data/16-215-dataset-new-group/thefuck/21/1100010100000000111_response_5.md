## Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to identify if the command is related to `git stash` and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the rule fails when the script is just "`git`", resulting in an "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The error occurs when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]` without checking if the split list has at least two elements.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not check if the `command.script.split()` produces a list with at least two elements before accessing the second element. This results in an `IndexError: list index out of range` when the split list does not have enough elements.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If not, the function should return `False` to indicate that the command does not match the criteria.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
