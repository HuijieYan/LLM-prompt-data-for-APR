The buggy function is defined as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The potential error locations within the function are in the following lines:
- `command.script.split()[1]`: This splits the command script by spaces and tries to access the second element, which may result in an `IndexError` if the script doesn't have enough elements after splitting.
- `'usage:' in command.stderr`: This checks if the string 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. If the stderr doesn't contain this string, the condition will be False.


The cause of the bug is that the function expects the input `command.script` to have at least one space-separated element after splitting, and it also expects the string 'usage:' to be present in `command.stderr`. The GitHub issue shows the traceback where the `IndexError` occurred due to the list index being out of range when trying to access the second element after splitting the script.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `command.script` has at least two elements after splitting, and also handle the case when 'usage:' is not in `command.stderr`.

Below is the corrected version of the function to address the bug:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        if script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return True
    return False
```

In the corrected version, we split the script of the command and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1. If it is, we proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. If both conditions are met, we return `True`, otherwise, we return `False`.

This corrected version addresses the potential `IndexError` by checking the length of `script_parts` before trying to access its second element, and it also handles the case when 'usage:' is not in `command.stderr`.
