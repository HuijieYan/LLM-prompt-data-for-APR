## Fixing the bug

The buggy function is currently checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. However, it is not properly handling the case where there might be additional words after 'stash' in the command.

To fix the bug, we should split the command script and then check if the second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

### The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
