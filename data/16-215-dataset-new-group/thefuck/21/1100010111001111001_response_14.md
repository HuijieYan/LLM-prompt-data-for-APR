The bug in the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of "usage:" in the `stderr` of the `command`, but it splits the `script` and compares it with 'stash', which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `stderr` instead of the `script`, and then check if the first word of the split `stderr` is 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.stderr.split()[0] == 'usage:')
```
