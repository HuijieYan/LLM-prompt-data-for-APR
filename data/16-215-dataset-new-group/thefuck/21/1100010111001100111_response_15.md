The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule occurs when the `git stash` command is called with no arguments, so the command script only contains "git". This causes the buggy function to fail due to an index out of range error when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the buggy function to first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, the function will first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before attempting to access the second element, preventing the index out of range error. This will allow the function to handle cases where the `git stash` command is called without any additional arguments.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
