The bug in the provided function is that it checks for the presence of the string 'stash' in the command.script, but it does not check the actual command used, or the presence of the usage message in the stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command used is 'git stash' and if the usage message is present in the stderr. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ("git stash" in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly check if the command used is 'git stash' and if the usage message is present in the stderr, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
