### Analysis
The buggy function is checking if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. The error message indicates that there is an index out of range error, suggesting that the `split()` method on `command.script` is causing the issue.

### Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be at least two words in `command.script`. If the `command.script` is empty or only contains one word, then accessing the second index of the split list will result in an index out of range error.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that there are at least two words in `command.script` before attempting to access the second word.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (len(command.script.split()) > 1
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
