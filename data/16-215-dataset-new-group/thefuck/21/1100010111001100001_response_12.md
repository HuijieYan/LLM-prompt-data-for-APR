The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to a git stash and if the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash', which may not be accurate.

The cause of the bug is that the function only checks the second word in the command script without considering other possible parameters or options that could be included in the git command.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By using the `startswith` method, we ensure that the command is related to git stash and we also include any possible parameters or options that may come after 'git stash'.

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
