The buggy function is trying to match a command that contains the word "stash" and where the stderr includes "usage:". However, the buggy function is causing an IndexError when trying to split the command script.

The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming that the command script will always contain at least two words. This assumption leads to an IndexError when accessing index 1 of the split command script.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the script contains at least two words before attempting to access index 1. If it does not, then the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    if len(script_words) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the script contains at least two words, and if it does not, it will return False. If the script does contain at least two words, it will then perform the matching based on the split script and stderr contents. This should fix the IndexError and make the function behave as expected.
