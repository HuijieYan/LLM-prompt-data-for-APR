The cause of the bug is an IndexError that occurs because the `command.script.split()` is returning a list with only one element (['git']), and trying to access the second element will result in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the splitted_script list has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splitted_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splitted_script) > 1 
            and splitted_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `splitted_script` before accessing the second element, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring. This fix should make the function pass the failing test.
