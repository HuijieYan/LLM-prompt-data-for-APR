The problem with the buggy function is that it assumes the `git` command will always have the word `stash` as the second word in the script, which is not the case when the script is just `git`. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second index of the split script.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to check if the script contains the word `stash` instead of directly accessing the second index of the split script.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification will ensure that the function correctly identifies the usage of the `git stash` command within the script, avoiding the IndexError when the command is just `git`.
