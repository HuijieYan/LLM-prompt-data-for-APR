### Fixing the bug
The buggy function is attempting to split the `command.script` and then check if the second element is equal to 'stash', which is causing an `IndexError` when `command.script` does not have a second element. This is why the failing test is encountering an `IndexError: list index out of range`. To fix this, we need to first check if `command.script` splits into at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
