## Analysis:
The buggy function is meant to match the command with a specific condition, but it is currently causing an `IndexError` when accessing the split command. The condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` is causing the error when the `command.script` does not contain enough words to split into an array with an index of 1.

## Identified error locations:
The main potential error location is the line `command.script.split()[1]`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by trying to access index 1 of the split command without checking if the split command actually results in a list with enough elements.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to first check if the split command has enough elements before trying to access index 1.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(command_parts) > 1 and command_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
