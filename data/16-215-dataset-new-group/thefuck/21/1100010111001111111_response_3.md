The bug seems to be caused by the function accessing the second element of the split command, assuming that it always exists. The failing test shows that accessing the second item from split command result in IndexOutofBounds error, hence, the failing test.

We can fix the issue by first checking if the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second item. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```

The corrected function checks the length of `split_script` before comparing its second element to 'stash'. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
