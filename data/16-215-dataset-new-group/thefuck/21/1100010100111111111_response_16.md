The buggy function is failing because it is trying to access index 1 of the split command.script without checking if it exists or not. This causes an IndexError when the command.script is just 'git', as in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before accessing index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks the length of the split script before trying to access index 1, preventing the IndexError. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
