The issue is caused by the function trying to access the second element of `command.script.split()` without checking if the list actually has more than 1 element. This results in a "list index out of range" error.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the list has at least two elements before trying to access the second one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version first splits the script and then checks if the length of the resulting list is greater than 1 before proceeding to access the second element and compare it with 'stash'.
