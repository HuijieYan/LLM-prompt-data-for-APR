The bug in the `match` function is that it assumes the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when using `split()` method without checking it. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the list returned by `split()`.

To fix this bug, we need to check that the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
