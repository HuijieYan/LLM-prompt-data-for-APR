The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command starts with "git stash" and if the string "usage:" is present in the stderr. However, the buggy function is failing to handle the case where the input command does not contain an index 1 after splitting.

The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split command script, but it does not exist. This is because the input command is just "git" and does not have a second split element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, the function should return False.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) > 1
        and split_script[1] == "stash"
        and "usage:" in command.stderr
    )
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split command script has at least two elements. If not, it will return False. If there are at least two elements, it will proceed to check if the second element is "stash" and if "usage:" is present in the command's stderr.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
