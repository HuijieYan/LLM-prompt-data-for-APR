The buggy function is `match`, which is a part of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The function checks if the command starts with "git stash" and whether the string "usage:" is present in the command's standard error output. If these conditions are met, it returns `True`, otherwise `False`.

The failing test `test_not_match` tries to assert that the `match` function returns `False` when the `stderr` includes the appropriate error message.

The error message during the failing test indicates that there is an IndexError in the function's code. It occurs when trying to split the `command.script`, resulting in a list index out of range.

The expected values and types of the relevant variables during the failing test execution are not provided. However, the function aims to return `False` in this case.

The GitHub issue regarding this bug indicates that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is simply "git", causing the list index out of range error.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should first check if `command.script` starts with "git stash" and then check if "usage:" is present in the `command.stderr`. Also, additional checks should be added for cases where `command.script` does not contain a space-separated command and adjust the code accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
