The buggy function is intended to check if the command is related to "git stash" and if the error message contains "usage:". However, the buggy function is throwing an IndexError when trying to access the second element of the split command.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not check if the script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to first check the length of the command.script.split() array before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1 
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
