## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` at line 8 of the `match` function. This error occurs when the `command.script` cannot be split into multiple parts, which suggests that the command script does not contain at least two words.

## Bug Location
The bug is located at the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
Here, the split operation is assuming that the `command.script` will always contain at least two words.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the `command.script` always contains at least two words. When the `command.script` is unable to split into multiple parts, it raises an `IndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We need to check if the `command.script` contains at least two words before performing the split operation. This can be done using an `if` condition.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
