```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The fix includes adding a check to ensure that the command script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This prevents the IndexError that was causing the failing test.
