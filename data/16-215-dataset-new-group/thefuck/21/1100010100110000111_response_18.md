The buggy function is failing with the following error message:
```text
IndexError: list index out of range
```

The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of the problem, indicating that the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the script is just "git" without any additional arguments.

The buggy function has a potential error location in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The error is likely occurring because `command.script.split()` may not contain any elements when the command is just "git", resulting in an IndexError when trying to access index 1.

To fix the bug, the function should first check the length of the split result before trying to access index 1. If the length is not sufficient, the function should immediately return False.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
