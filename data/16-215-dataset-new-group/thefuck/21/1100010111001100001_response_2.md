The buggy function is supposed to check if the git command is related to stashing and whether the error message contains the word 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is not checking if the command is 'stash' and is instead checking for 'stash' as the second word in the script.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison to 'stash' and not checking the full error message.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command is 'stash' and if the error message contains 'usage:'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass.
