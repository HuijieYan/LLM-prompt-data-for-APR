The bug occurs in the match function of the git_fix_stash rule when the script is just "git". The bug happens because the condition checks for the existence of a second word after splitting the script, which doesn't exist in the case of "git".

To fix the bug, the match function should check if the script is exactly "git stash", rather than splitting the script and checking for the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the match function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script == 'git stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the match function should now correctly identify the "git stash" command and return True for that case. This will resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test scenario.
