### Analysis
The buggy function currently checks if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error lies in the comparison of the second word in the command script and the presence of 'usage:' in the command's stderr.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the function. It is not properly checking for the intended condition.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Modify the function to properly check for the presence of the word 'stash' in the command and for the expected error message in the command's stderr.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.strip().startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
