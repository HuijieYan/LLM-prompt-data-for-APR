### Analysis
The buggy function is using the `split` method on the `command.script` to check if the second part of the script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. This function is likely intended to match when the git command is 'stash' and there is an error in the stderr.

### Bug
The bug is that the function does not handle cases where the `command.script` is not long enough to have a second part, which will result in an `IndexError` when trying to access `split()[1]`.

### Fix
We need to first check if the `command.script` has at least two parts before comparing the second part to 'stash'.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
