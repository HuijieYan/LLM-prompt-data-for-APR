The bug in the function `match` occurs because it's trying to split the `command.script` without checking if it has enough elements after the split.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the `command.script` has at least two elements after the split before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
