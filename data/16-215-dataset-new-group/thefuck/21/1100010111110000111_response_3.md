## Explanation:
The buggy function is causing an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()` without checking whether the split operation actually returns more than one element. The buggy function is supposed to check if the command script contains `git stash` and the stderr contains 'usage:', but it does so without proper error handling.

## Solution:
The bug can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that the split operation returns at least two elements before accessing the second element.

## The corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
