The bug in the `match` function is that it is not correctly checking for the presence of the word "stash" in the command, and is also not correctly checking for the presence of the phrase "usage:" in the `stderr` attribute of the `command`.

In the provided case, the function fails to match the command because the split of the command.script does not include the word "stash", and the 'usage:' in the command.stderr is not being properly checked.

To fix the bug, we will modify the match function to correctly extract the command name from the command script and check for the presence of "stash" in it. Additionally, we will properly check for the presence of "usage:" in the command stderr.

Here is the fixed version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the fixed function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()[1]
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the provided failing test should pass.
