The bug in the function causes an IndexError because the split() function is used on command.script without checking if it contains more than one word. When the script is just 'git', this causes the index to go out of range. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if the split() operation on command.script returns a list with at least two items before trying to access the second item as 'stash'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split operation on command.script generates a list with at least two items before attempting to access the second item. This will prevent the IndexError and resolve the bug.
