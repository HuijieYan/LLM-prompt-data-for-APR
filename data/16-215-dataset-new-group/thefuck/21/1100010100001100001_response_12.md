The buggy function is trying to match the command script to check if it contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the current implementation only checks the second word in the script for 'stash' and doesn't account for the multi-line output in stderr.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if 'stash' is present anywhere in the script and if 'usage:' is present anywhere in stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
