The buggy function has an issue with the command.script.split()[1] expression because it assumes that the input command contains at least two elements when split. However, in the failing test, the input command.script is 'git', which results in only one element after the split, causing the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing index 1. If it doesn't, we can return False to indicate that the command doesn't match.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split_script has at least two elements before accessing index 1, avoiding the IndexError. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
