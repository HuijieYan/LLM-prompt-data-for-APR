The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if a git command is trying to use the `stash` feature but is providing an incorrect usage. The function then returns a boolean indicating whether the command matches this condition.

The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` in the buggy function, specifically at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. This implies that the `split()` method is failing to find the second element in the `command.script` list, resulting in an `IndexError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `split()` method is being called without checking if `command.script` contains any elements. This is causing the `IndexError` because if `command.script` is an empty list, there is no element at index 1 to access.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.script` contains any elements before attempting to access the second element using the `split()` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split `command.script` into parts and store it in `script_parts`. Then, we check if `script_parts` has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. If it does, we proceed to check if the second element is `'stash'` and if `'usage:'` is in `command.stderr`. This approach prevents the `IndexError` by ensuring that there are enough elements to access before attempting to do so.
