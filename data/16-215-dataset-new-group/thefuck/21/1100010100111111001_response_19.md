The buggy function splits the `command.script` and checks if the second element is equal to 'stash', and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. The bug occurs because the `command.script` is split and the resulting list might not have an element at index 1. This causes the IndexError when trying to access the second element of the list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split `command.script` is at least 2 before accessing the second element. Additionally, we should check if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
