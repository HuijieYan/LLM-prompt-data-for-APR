The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is related to Git stash and if the error message contains the word "usage:". However, the buggy function has an issue with accessing the list element after splitting the command script. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access `command.script.split()[1]` in scenarios where the list returned by `split()` doesn't have an element at index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing `split()[1]`. If not, the function should return `False`. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In this corrected version, we check if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1. If it is, we proceed to check the conditions for matching the Git stash command. If not, we return `False` immediately. This ensures that we avoid the IndexError when accessing the elements of the split script.
