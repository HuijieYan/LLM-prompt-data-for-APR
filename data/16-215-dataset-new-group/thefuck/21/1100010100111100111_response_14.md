The issue with the buggy function is that it assumes `command.script` always contains at least two elements when split by whitespaces. However, in this case, when the `command.script` is just 'git', splitting it by whitespaces results in a list with only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `command.script` is split into at least two elements before trying to access the second element of the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected version, we first split the `command.script` into parts and store it in the `script_parts` variable. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` and resolves the bug.
