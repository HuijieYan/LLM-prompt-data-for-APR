The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule causes the function to fail when the `command.script` is just `'git'`. This is because the buggy function splits the `command.script` and tries to access the second element, which does not exist when the script is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `match` function to first check the length of `command.script.split()` before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version checks the length of `script_parts` to ensure that it has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
