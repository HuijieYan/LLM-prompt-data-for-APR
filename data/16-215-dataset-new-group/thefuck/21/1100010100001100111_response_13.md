The buggy function `match` is trying to split the `command.script` and check if the second element is `'stash'`, but it does not handle the case where there is no second element, resulting in an `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `'git'`. The buggy function does not consider the possibility of an empty `command.script` or a `command.script` that does not contain the word `'stash'`. It only checks for the presence of `'stash'` in the `command.script` without considering the index of the split result.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the `command.script` contains the word `'stash'`, and then split the script and check for the second element if it exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix includes checking the length of `script` to ensure that it has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the script is just `'git'`.
