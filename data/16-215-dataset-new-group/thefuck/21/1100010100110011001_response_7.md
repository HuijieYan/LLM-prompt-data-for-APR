### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to check if the given command is a git stash command by looking at the second word in the command script and verifying the presence of "usage:" in the command's stderr. However, the buggy code is causing an IndexError due to trying to access the second word in the command script without checking if it exists.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is failing because it is assuming that there will always be a second word in the command script. When the command does not contain a second word, an IndexError is raised, causing the function to fail.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the command script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

### The corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
