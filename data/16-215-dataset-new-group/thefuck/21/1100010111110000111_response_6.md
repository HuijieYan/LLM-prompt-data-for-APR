### Analysis
The `match` function in the `git_fix_stash` rule fails when the command script is just 'git', and the error occurs due to an `IndexError` in the `command.script.split()[1]` expression.

### Error Location
The error occurs in the `command.script.split()[1]` expression within the `match` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by assuming that the command script always contains at least two elements when splitting by whitespace. However, when the command script is just 'git', splitting it by whitespace results in a list with only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If it does not, then the 'stash' check will not be applicable.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The corrected version first checks if the split script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` and ensures that the 'stash' check is only performed if the conditions are met.
