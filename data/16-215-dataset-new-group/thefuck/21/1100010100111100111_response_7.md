The buggy function is designed to check if the script in the given command is "git stash" and if the error message contains "usage:". However, the error is caused by an attempt to access the second element of the split command script, assuming there is a second element, which is not always the case. This results in a list index out of range.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the script has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
