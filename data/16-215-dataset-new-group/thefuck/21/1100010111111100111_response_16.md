To fix the bug, we need to account for the case where the `command.script` is only `'git'`, as this is causing the `IndexError`. We can do this by first checking if the length of the `command.script.split()` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

The corrected version checks if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element with `script_parts[1]`. This should prevent the `IndexError` when the `command.script` is only `'git'`.

This correction should resolve the issue and the failing test since the function will now handle the case where the `command.script` does not contain more than one element after splitting. Additionally, it fixes the reported bug on GitHub.
