The buggy function is designed to check if the `git` command with a specific script and an error message including 'usage:' in it. However, the buggy function has an error where it splits the `command.script` and tries to access the second index.

The cause of the bug is an `IndexError` due to the split command not finding any whitespace in the `command.script`, and therefore, not producing a list with more than one element.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `split` command actually does produce a list with at least two elements before trying to access the second index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` and checking the length of the resulting list before accessing the second index, we prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
