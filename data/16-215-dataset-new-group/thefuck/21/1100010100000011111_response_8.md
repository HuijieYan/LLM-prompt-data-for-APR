The buggy function is designed to match the command script and error message in order to identify a specific issue with the `git` command. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when the script is just `git`, the `git_fix_stash` rule fails.

The buggy function `match` attempts to split the command script and check if the second part is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The bug is caused by assuming that there will always be a second part to the split command script, which is not the case when the script is just 'git'. This leads to a `IndexError` when attempting to access the second part of the split command script.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the command script contains more than one part before attempting to access the second part. If it does, then we can perform the comparison, otherwise, it does not satisfy the condition and should return `False`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) > 1:
        return parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the script contains more than one part, and only then proceed to compare the second part with 'stash' and check for 'usage:' in the command's stderr. If the script is just 'git', the condition will not be met and the function will return `False`, which resolves the bug.
