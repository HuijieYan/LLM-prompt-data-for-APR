## The bug in the provided function
The bug in the provided function occurs due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script. The function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash', but when the script is just 'git', the function fails because it tries to access an element that doesn't exist in the split list.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element. If the length is not sufficient, the function should return `False` indicating that the command does not match.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script length is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element. If the check fails, it will return `False`. This ensures that the function doesn't encounter an `IndexError` when dealing with shorter command scripts.
