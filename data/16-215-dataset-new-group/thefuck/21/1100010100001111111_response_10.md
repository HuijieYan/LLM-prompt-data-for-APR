The bug in the function is that it attempts to access the second element (index 1) of the splited_script list before checking if the list is not empty. This causes an IndexError when the `command.script` is just `'git'`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` actually contains multiple elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    splited_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(splited_script) > 1 and splited_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function first splits the script and then checks if the resulting list has more than one element before trying to access the second element. This ensures that the function does not attempt to access an element that does not exist, thereby fixing the bug.
