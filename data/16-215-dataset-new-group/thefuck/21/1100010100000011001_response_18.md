### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to check if the command is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the script split does not have a second index (i.e., the command is shorter than expected). Additionally, it does not handle cases where the word "usage:" is not in the stderr.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the assumption that the split command will always have a second index, and by only checking for the presence of "usage:" in the stderr without handling cases where it is not present.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to validate that the split command has a second index before attempting to compare it with "stash". Additionally, we should handle cases where "usage:" is not in the stderr.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
