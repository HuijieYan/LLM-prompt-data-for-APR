The buggy function is supposed to check whether the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr.

The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the buggy function is trying to access an index in a list that does not exist. This means that the split() method is not finding the second word in the command script.

This is likely happening because the command script does not contain a second word, or it is not being split correctly.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to make sure that the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return (len(words) > 1 and words[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the `split()` method will only be called if there are at least two words in the command script, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
