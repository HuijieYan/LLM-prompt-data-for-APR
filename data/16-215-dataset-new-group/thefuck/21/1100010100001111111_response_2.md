## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the line `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` in the `match` function. When the `command.script` is just `'git'`, the `split()[1]` will cause an `IndexError` since there is no index 1 after splitting the string.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split is greater than 1 before accessing the index.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
