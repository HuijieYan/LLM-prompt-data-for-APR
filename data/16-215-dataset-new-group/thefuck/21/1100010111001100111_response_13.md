## Correction
The buggy function fails to check whether the list `command.script` contains the word 'stash', and instead tries to access the index `1` of the split list, which results in an `IndexError` since the list is empty when the command is just 'git'.

To fix this, we can modify the `match` function to explicitly check if the word 'stash' is present in the `command.script` list before splitting it and accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, the updated function will first check if the word 'stash' is present in the `command.script` list, and then proceed to check if 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. This fix ensures that the function will handle the case where the command is just 'git', preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
