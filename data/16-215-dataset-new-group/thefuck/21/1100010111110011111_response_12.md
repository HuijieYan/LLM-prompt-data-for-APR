## Analysis
The `match` function is intended to match a specific command in Git where the second word in the command is 'stash' and where the error message contains 'usage:'. The failing test is checking that the function doesn't match when the command is just 'git', and the error message contains the 'stash' usage information.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle the case where the command is just 'git' and tries to access the second element of the split command which leads to an `IndexError`.

## Bug Location
The issue is with the line `command.script.split()[1]` which is causing the `IndexError` when the `command.script` doesn't have enough elements after splitting.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If the length is not greater than 1, then we can safely assume that the match condition is not met and return `False`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
