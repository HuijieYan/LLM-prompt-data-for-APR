### Analysis:

The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is `git stash` and if the stderr includes the string 'usage:'. However, it is currently incorrectly implemented and fails to return the correct result.

### Error Location:
The error is in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` and the check for 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function fails to correctly identify the command as `git stash` and also fails to check for 'usage:' in the stderr. This causes the function to return the wrong result.

### Fix Strategy:
The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly check if the command is `git stash` and then verify if 'usage:' is present in the stderr. By fixing these conditions, the function can return the correct result.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
