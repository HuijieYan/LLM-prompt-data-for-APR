The issue with the buggy function is that it assumes that the `command.script` always contains at least two elements when splitting by whitespace. This assumption is causing an IndexError when the `command.script` has only one element (in this case, when it is just `'git'`).

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to first check for the length of `command.script` before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The change made is to store the result of `command.script.split()` into the variable `script_elements` and then check its length before accessing the second element.

This corrected version should resolve the IndexError when the `command.script` has only one element and effectively pass the failing test.
