The buggy function `match` is failing to handle the case where the `command.script` has only one element. The buggy function is attempting to access the second element of the split script, which results in an `IndexError` because there is only one element in the split script.


To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if the split script has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. If there is only one element, it means that the script is simply `'git'` and does not contain the word `'stash'`.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

By checking the length of the split script before accessing the second element, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This fix ensures that the function handles the case where the `command.script` has only one element, such as `'git'`, and returns the correct result for the test.
