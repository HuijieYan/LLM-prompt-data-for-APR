The bug in the function `match` is causing the "index out of range" error because the current implementation is splitting `command.script` and then attempting to access the second element, which doesn't exist when `script` is just `'git'`. This causes the function to fail and not match the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If the length is not greater than 1, the function should return False, indicating that the command does not match.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) <= 1:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
