The bug in the function is that it is trying to access index 1 of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if there are enough elements in the list. This is causing an `IndexError` when the `command.script` is just `'git'` and there is no element at index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has enough elements before trying to access index 1. We can do this using an if statement to check the length of the list before accessing index 1.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in a variable `split_script`. Then we check if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 before accessing index 1 to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. If the condition is satisfied, the function proceeds to check for the presence of 'stash' in index 1 and 'usage:' in `command.stderr`.
