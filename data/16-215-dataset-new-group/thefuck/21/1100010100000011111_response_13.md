### Analysis
The `match` function is using the `split()` method on `command.script` without checking if the script actually contains more than one word. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second word when there's only one.

### Cause of the bug
The function assumes that `command.script` will always contain the word "stash" as the second word, leading to an `IndexError` when the script only contains one word.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
We should add a check to ensure that `command.script` contains more than one word before trying to access the second word. If not, we can assume that it doesn't match the condition and return `False`.

### Corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version first splits `command.script` into words and then checks if there are more than one word before accessing the second word. If there's only one word, the function returns `False`, otherwise it proceeds with the original condition check.
