The buggy function is supposed to match when the git command has 'stash' as its second argument and when the error message contains 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is flawed and causes an `IndexError` when the `split()` operation is called on the command.script string.

The cause of the bug is that the code blindly assumes that the `command.script` will always contain at least one space-separated argument. However, in the failing test case, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, which results in an empty list after the split operation and raises an `IndexError` when trying to access the non-existent second element.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there are enough elements in the split list before accessing the second element to avoid the `IndexError`. Alternatively, we can also check if 'stash' is present in the split list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the command script to `script_parts` and checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we ensure that there are enough elements to access without raising an `IndexError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
