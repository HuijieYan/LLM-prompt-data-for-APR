### Analysis
The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the command stderr contains the word "usage:". However, the current implementation does not handle scenarios where the word "stash" is not present in the command script. 

### Identification of potential error locations
The potential error is located in the comparison of `command.script.split()[1]` with 'stash' without checking if the split actually contains the 'stash'.


### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not check whether the split of the command actually contains the word "stash" before comparing it. This can lead to an "index out of range" error if the command script does not contain the word "stash".

### Bug-fixing strategy
In order to fix the bug, we need to first check if the split of the command contains the word "stash" before attempting to access its index.


### The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
