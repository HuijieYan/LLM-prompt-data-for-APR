The buggy function is designed to check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the error message contains the string 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is checking if the second word in the command is 'stash', which is not a reliable way to determine if the command is related to `git stash`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is only checking the second word of the command, and it does not take into account the possibility of additional arguments or options in the command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check if the command is related to `git stash` and if the error message contains the string 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version checks if the command contains 'git stash' anywhere in the script, and it also verifies if the error message contains the 'usage:' string. This approach is more robust and should correctly identify commands related to `git stash`.
