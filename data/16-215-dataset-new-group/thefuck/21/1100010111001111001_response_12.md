The buggy function `match` is supposed to return True if the command is `git stash` and the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, there is an issue with the comparison in the return statement.

The bug is causing the function to not identify the correct command and return False when it should be returning True.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the return statement so that it checks if the command contains 'stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly identify the command and return True as expected.
