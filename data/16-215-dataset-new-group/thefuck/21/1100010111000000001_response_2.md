The buggy function `match` is designed to determine if a git command is trying to use the `stash` subcommand and if it has failed by checking the stderr for the presence of the string 'usage:'. However, the current implementation is flawed and does not match the expected behavior. The potential error locations within the function are the comparison statement and the condition for checking the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison statement `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` may not always correctly identify the 'stash' subcommand in all cases. Additionally, the condition for checking the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr is too simplistic and may not cover all possible error messages related to the 'stash' subcommand.

To fix the bug, a better strategy would be to use a more robust approach to identify the subcommand 'stash' within the git command and to improve the condition for checking the error message in the stderr to ensure it accurately reflects the failure of the 'stash' subcommand.

Here is the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) > 1 and parts[1] == 'stash' and 'ERROR:' in command.stderr:
        return True
    return False
```

With this corrected version, the function checks if the second part of the git command is 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'ERROR:', which is a more reliable indication of a failed 'stash' subcommand. This should fix the bug and make the test `test_not_match` pass.
