The buggy function is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the script does not have a second word, leading to an index out of range error when trying to access index 1 of the split script.

The cause of the bug is that the function assumes the command script will always have at least two words, which is not the case when the script is just 'git'. To fix this bug, we need to check if the split script has at least two words before accessing index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (
        len(split_script) > 1
        and split_script[1] == 'stash'
        and 'usage:' in command.stderr
    )
```

This corrected version first splits the script into words and then checks if there are at least two words before accessing index 1. This should prevent the index out of range error and fix the bug.
