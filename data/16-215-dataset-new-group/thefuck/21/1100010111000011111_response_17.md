The buggy function `match` checks if the command script's second word is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. The failing test `test_not_match` provides the command 'git' and the stderr containing the git usage information.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function assumes there is a second word in the command's script, which is not true in the failing test case. This leads to the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command.script has enough words before accessing the second word. We also need to ensure that 'usage:' is present in command.stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version checks if there are more than one word in the command.script before accessing the second word, avoiding the IndexError. It also retains the check for 'usage:' in command.stderr. This fix should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test case.
