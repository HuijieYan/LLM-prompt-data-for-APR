The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word "stash" and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" which means that the list split from the command.script does not have an element at index 1.

The bug is caused by the assumption that the script will always have at least 2 elements when split by whitespace, which is not true for the provided input.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the script has enough elements before accessing index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and 
            script_parts[1] == 'stash' 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that we first check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before accessing index 1.
