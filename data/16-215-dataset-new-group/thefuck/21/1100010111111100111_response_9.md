The bug in the provided function `match` occurs because the function assumes that the second element in `command.script.split()` will always be `'stash'`. However, this assumption is incorrect when the input command is simply `'git'`, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access an element at index 1 that does not exist.

To fix this bug, we can add a condition to check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring, and the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
