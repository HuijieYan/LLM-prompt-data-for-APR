The bug in the `git_fix_stash` rule is due to the buggy function not handling the case where the command script is just 'git'. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the split command script. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the command script contains at least two elements before accessing the second element. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```

With this corrected function, the `IndexError` will be prevented, and the function will correctly handle the case where the command script is just 'git'. This fix satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the GitHub issue.
