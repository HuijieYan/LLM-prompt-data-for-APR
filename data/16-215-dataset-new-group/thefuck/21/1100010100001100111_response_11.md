The buggy function is designed to match a command against a Git-specific pattern. The function checks if the second word in the command script is "stash" and if the word "usage:" is in the command's standard error output.

### Errors in the buggy function
1. The function does not handle the case where the input command has fewer than two words, resulting in a list index out of range error.
2. The function incorrectly splits the command script without checking if it has the expected number of words.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the command script will always have at least two words, leading to an index out of range error when the assumption is not met. This is evident from the input parameter values and types, where the command.script only contains one word "git."

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should check if the command script has at least two words before trying to access the second word to avoid the index out of range error.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, we first split the command script into individual words and then check if there are more than one word before accessing the second word to compare it with "stash." This approach prevents the index out of range error and ensures that the function works as expected.
