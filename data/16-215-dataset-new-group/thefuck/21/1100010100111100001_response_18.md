The buggy function is designed to check if the command script contains the word 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The error occurs due to the assumption that the command script contains at least two words, which leads to an index out of range error when trying to access the second word.

To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split script before trying to access its second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the split script contains more than 1 element before trying to access the second element. This avoids the index out of range error.
