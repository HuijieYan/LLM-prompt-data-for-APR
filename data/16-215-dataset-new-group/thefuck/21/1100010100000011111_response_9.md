The buggy function is attempting to split the command script and check if the second element is equal to 'stash', and if the stderr contains the string 'usage:'. However, the buggy function is causing an error due to a list index out of range.


To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the command script has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second index of the split list.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return (len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected version ensures that the script has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second index. This will prevent the list index out of range error and satisfy the expected input/output values.
