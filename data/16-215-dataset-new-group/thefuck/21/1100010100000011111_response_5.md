In the provided buggy function, the issue is caused by trying to access the second index of the split script without checking if it exists.

The cause of the bug is that the function is assuming the command.script to contain at least two elements. However, in the failing test execution shown in the GitHub issue, the command.script is just 'git', and the buggy function is trying to access index 1 which does not exist, leading to the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to first check if the length of the split script is greater than or equal to 2 before trying to access the second index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_split = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_split) > 1
            and script_split[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By first checking the length of the split script, we can ensure that we only access index 1 if it exists, avoiding the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.
