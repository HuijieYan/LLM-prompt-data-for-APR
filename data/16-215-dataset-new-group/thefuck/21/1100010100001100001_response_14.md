## Correction
The buggy function is supposed to match the `git stash` command with the stderr containing "usage:". However, the current implementation is checking only for the presence of "usage:" in the entire stderr. This can cause issues if "usage:" appears in other parts of the stderr.

To fix this, we should split the stderr into individual lines and check if any of the lines contain the "usage:" string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and any('usage:' in line for line in stderr_lines))
```

By splitting the stderr into lines and checking each line individually, we ensure that we correctly match the "usage:" string related to the `git stash` command and avoid false positives from other parts of the stderr.
