Based on the GitHub issue, the problem occurs when the script is just 'git', which causes an IndexError in the buggy function. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if the command is equal to 'stash' and also ensure that there are enough elements in the split command script to avoid an IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version:
- We store the split script in a variable called `split_script` to avoid splitting it multiple times.
- We add a condition to check if the length of `split_script` is greater than 1 to ensure that there are enough elements to access the index 1.
- Then we check if the element at index 1 is equal to 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
