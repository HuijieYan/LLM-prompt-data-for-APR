The buggy function has an issue that causes an `IndexError` when trying to access an element of the split command script. The issue is related to the `git_fix_stash` rule failing when the script is just `git`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case when the script is just `git`. We can check if the length of the split command script is at least 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version of the function first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the split parts is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This change will prevent the `IndexError` when the script is just `git`.
