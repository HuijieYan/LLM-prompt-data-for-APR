### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the `git stash` command has been entered incorrectly by looking for the string "usage:" in the error message. However, the buggy function is causing an IndexError due to trying to access the second element of the split command without proper error handling.

### Bug location
The buggy location is in the line:
```python
return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
The `command.script.split()[1]` is causing the IndexError when the split result is empty or has only one element.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function is trying to access the second element of the split command without checking if it exists. This leads to an IndexError when the split result is empty or has only one element.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
Modify the code to first check if the split command is not empty before accessing its elements. Then, check if the first element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
