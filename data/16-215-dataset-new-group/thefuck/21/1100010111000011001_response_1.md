### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is supposed to return True if the command starts with `git stash` and the word `usage:` is in the stderr. However, the function is not handling the case of the command starting with `git` followed by `stash`. The function is looking for the exact match of `git stash` in the script, so it will fail in the mentioned test case.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error location is in the condition `command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. It is only checking for an exact match instead of checking if the command starts with `git stash`.

### Bug cause
The buggy function is not correctly identifying the command as starting with `git stash`, causing it to return False when it should return True.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should check if the command starts with `git stash` instead of an exact match. This can be achieved by modifying the condition to check for the start of the command.

### Bug-fixed code
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.startswith('git stash')
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
