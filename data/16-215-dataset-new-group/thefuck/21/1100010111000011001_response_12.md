### Analysis
The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command passed in is a git stash command and if the stderr contains the word "usage:". The potential error locations could be in how the script is split and how the conditions for the check are being evaluated.

The failing test `test_not_match` is expected to return `True` for a Command object with the command "git" and the stderr as "git_stash_err".

### Bug
The bug in the `match` function lies in how the conditions for the check are being evaluated. The function may not handle cases where the script doesn't split into two parts or where the stderr doesn't contain the word "usage:".

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the script has at least two parts before accessing the second part.
2. Update the condition to check if the stderr contains the word "usage:".

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
