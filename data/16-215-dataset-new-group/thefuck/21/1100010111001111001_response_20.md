## Fixing the bug

The buggy function is currently checking if the second word in the command's script is 'stash' and if the command's stderr contains the word 'usage:'. However, the input parameter `command` is an instance of the `Command` class, and the `script` attribute may contain multiple words. Additionally, the error message is contained in the `stderr` attribute and not the `stdout` attribute.

To fix the bug, the function should split the `command.script` and check each word to see if 'stash' is present. Additionally, it should check if the 'usage:' message is present in the `command.stderr`.

## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return ('stash' in script_words
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function correctly checks if 'stash' is present in the `command.script` and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output values.
