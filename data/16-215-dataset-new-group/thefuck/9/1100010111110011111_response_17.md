The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and its argument from the `git push` command. Additionally, the `push_upstream` is not being generated correctly from the `stderr` parameter.

The error occurs because the function is not correctly identifying the index of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options in the `command.script_parts` list, and when trying to remove the elements at the identified indexes, it throws an `IndexError` as there might not be items at those indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the indexes of the options and then remove them from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the `push_upstream` needs to be extracted correctly from the `stderr` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-3:]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
```

This corrected version of the function correctly identifies the indexes of the options and removes them from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, it correctly extracts the `push_upstream` from the `stderr` parameter. This corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue.
