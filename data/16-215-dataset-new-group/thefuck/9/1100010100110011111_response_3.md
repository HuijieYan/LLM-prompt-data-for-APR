## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using `if` statements instead of `try-except`, we can safely check for the presence of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command to avoid the IndexError. We also correctly remove the item from `command.script_parts` when it is found. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
