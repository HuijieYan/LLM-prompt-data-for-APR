The bug is in the `upstream_option_index` `try` blocks that look for '--set-upstream' and '-u' in `command.script_parts` and set `upstream_option_index` to the index being found.

The buggy function tries to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' from the `command.script_parts`, but it should only remove the argument of the found option.

The buggy function also tries to get the value of `push_upstream` by splitting `command.stderr`, which is not always reliable as the message may change.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of removing arguments and extracting the `push_upstream` value in the function.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the removal of the argument that comes after the found option and search for the `push_upstream` value using regular expressions for better reliability.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    command_parts = list(command.script_parts)
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command_parts):
            command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    # Extract the push_upstream value
    push_upstream_regex = re.compile(r'\bgit push (.+)$')
    push_upstream_match = push_upstream_regex.search(command.stderr)
    if push_upstream_match:
        push_upstream = push_upstream_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None
```
