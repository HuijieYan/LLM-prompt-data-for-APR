The buggy function `get_new_command` aims to process the `command` object in such a way that if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is passed in the command, it will remove it along with its argument. It then extracts the relevant information from the `stderr` attribute of the `command` and constructs a new command.

The error message shows that an `IndexError` is being raised when trying to pop the elements from the `command.script_parts` list since the index is out of range. This indicates that the `upstream_option_index` is not correctly pointing to the position of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command` object.

To fix the bug:
1. The function needs to correctly identify the position of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. It needs to handle the case when the flag is not found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the position of the flags in the `command.script_parts` list and handle the case when the flags are not found. This should resolve the `IndexError` and the function should now pass the failing test case with the expected input/output values.
