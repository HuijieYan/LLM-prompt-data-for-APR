The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly handles the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument. It also incorrectly extracts the pushed upstream branch from the command's stderr. This results in incorrect new command suggestions which fail the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument, as well as correctly extract the pushed upstream branch from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values and types. It also resolves the GitHub issue by fixing the suggestions for 'git push -u' commands.
