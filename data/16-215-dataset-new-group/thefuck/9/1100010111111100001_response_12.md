The bug in the get_new_command function is causing the failing tests. The function is supposed to parse a git push command and add the --set-upstream origin master flags to it. However, the function's logic for removing the --set-upstream or -u flags is causing an IndexError when these flags are not present.

The bug is occurring because when the --set-upstream or -u flags are not found, the upstream_option_index remains -1. Then, in the subsequent conditional statement, command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) is called regardless of whether the flags were found or not, leading to an IndexError when upstream_option_index is -1.

To fix the bug, we should add a check for upstream_option_index before calling the pop method to ensure that the flags were actually found before attempting to remove them.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for the presence of the --set-upstream or -u flags before attempting to remove them from the command. This should resolve the IndexError issues and make the function pass the failing tests.
