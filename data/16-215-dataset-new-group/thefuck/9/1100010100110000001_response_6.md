The buggy function is `get_new_command` and the error message is an `IndexError` thrown at line 27 of the function. The error indicates that the pop index is out of range, which means there is an attempt to remove an element from an empty list.

The cause of the bug is when the script command does not contain '--set-upstream' or '-u', the value of `upstream_option_index` is set to -1 and the subsequent pop operations on `command.script_parts` result in an empty list. This happens because the `try-except` blocks overwrite the value of `upstream_option_index` instead of appending to it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index is appended when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags are not found in `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
