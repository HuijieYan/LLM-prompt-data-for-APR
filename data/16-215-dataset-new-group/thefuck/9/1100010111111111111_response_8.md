The buggy function is the `get_new_command` function in the `thefuck/rules/git_push.py` file. The function is designed to manipulate the input command and return a modified version of it. The function attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command and then get the recommended push command from the stderr of the command.

The issue with the function is that it does not handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present in the `command.script_parts` list, which leads to an `IndexError` when attempting to remove elements from the list.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where these options are not present in the input command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            return " ".join(command.script_parts)  # No modification needed if options are not present

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, we handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present, and return the original command without modification in that case.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values.
