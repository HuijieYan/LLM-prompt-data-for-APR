```

### Explanation
The bug in the function is due to the pop index going out of range when the '-u' flag is present in the command. This is because the index is being popped twice in both the try-except blocks. Additionally, the logic of handling the '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags needs to be corrected as well.

In the corrected version, the try-except blocks are placed in the correct order to handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags. Also, the condition to check if the index is not equal to -1 has been fixed, and the pop operation is now performed only once for each flag.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the IndexError issue and provide the expected output for the failing test case.
