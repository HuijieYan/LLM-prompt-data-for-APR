The bug in the `get_new_command` function is the incorrect removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument from the command's `script_parts`. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` the element from the list that doesn't exist.

The incorrect removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument leads to the failing test and the corresponding error message. The failing test checks for the correct replacement of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` argument with the suggested branch in the git push command, which is not being handled correctly due to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the correct upstream option index is removed from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we need to handle the cases where no upstream option is present, and set the `push_upstream` variable accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u argument and its parameter
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Fetch the suggested branch and handle cases where it's not present
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the correction, the function now properly handles the removal of the upstream options and sets the `push_upstream` variable to 'origin master' when it's not provided in the stderr.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test and address the GitHub issue, providing the correct suggestions for the `git push -u` command.
