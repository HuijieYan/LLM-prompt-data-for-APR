The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is designed to modify a git push command. The function removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command. Then, it retrieves the last two lines from the stderr of the git push command and extracts the suggested command by `git` and returns a new command with additional arguments.

The failing test is `test_get_new_command(stderr)` from `tests/rules/test_git_push.py`.

The specific error message from the failing test is `IndexError: pop index out of range` and indicates that the `pop` operation is trying to access an index that is out of range of the list `command.script_parts`.

After analyzing the buggy function and error message, it's evident that the error occurs when trying to pop the `upstream_option_index` and its next index from the `command.script_parts` list.

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve:
1. Checking if the `upstream_option_index` is within the valid range before attempting the pop operation.
2. If the index is within range, perform a single pop operation.
3. Verify that the `push_upstream` extraction from the stderr is correct and consider any additional validations required for edge cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > (upstream_option_index + 1):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the pop operation is performed only if the `upstream_option_index` is within the range of valid indices of `command.script_parts`.
