The buggy function fails to correctly parse and modify the `script_parts` of the given command. It also refers to index values that don't exist in input list, leading to a `IndexError` when trying to pop items.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't correctly handle the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. It tries to remove them and their arguments from the `script_parts` list to construct a new command, but the handling of the list indices is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately identify the indices of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and correctly remove them from the `script_parts` list. Additionally, there might be cases where one or both of these options are not found, causing the `upstream_option_index` to remain -1. This condition should be correctly handled in the subsequent logic to avoid errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # remove the argument if present
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the fixed function, it should now accurately process the given command and return the correct modified command based on the stderr message provided. This should address the issues encountered in the failing test cases.
