The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` at `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` when the `command.script_parts` list is empty. This error occurs when the function tries to remove an element from an empty list, resulting in the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts`. We can also improve the logic for finding the push upstream command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in `command.script_parts` and removes them if they exist. Then, it extracts the push upstream command from the stderr output and uses it to construct the new command.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
