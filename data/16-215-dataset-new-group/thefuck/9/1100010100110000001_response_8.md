The bug occurs because when the `-u` flag is used in the `git push` command, the function attempts to find the index of this flag, but there is no condition to handle the second `try-except` block. As a result, if a `ValueError` occurs with the first try block, the second block executes, and if it fails, the `upstream_option_index` will remain as -1. This causes an `IndexError` later in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only activate the second `try-except` block if the first one fails to find the index of `"--set-upstream"`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
