In the provided buggy function, the code is attempting to find the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags and remove them from the command. Then, it goes on to fetch the relevant portion of the stderr and replace the 'push' command with the one including the '--set-upstream' and its argument.

The bug in this function lies in the attempt to remove the upstream option from the `command.script_parts` list. The code contains a mistake in the removal operation where the index is popped, and then the next item at the same index is also popped which results in an incorrect final list.

A better approach is to use the `remove` method to remove the elements from the list based on the value. Additionally, the extraction of the new push command is overly complex and can be simplified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return f'git {push_upstream}'
```

In this corrected version, we are directly checking for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list and removing them using the `remove` method. Additionally, the construction of the new push command has been simplified using f-strings to directly form the required command.
