The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when the `git push -u` command is used. This is because the function is trying to remove the `-u` argument from the command but makes an incorrect assumption about the position of the argument in the `command.script_parts` list.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the function handles the presence of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments correctly, and then extracts the correct push upstream argument from the `stderr` message. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index > 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the correct push upstream argument from the stderr message
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` correctly and extract the push upstream argument from the `stderr` message. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
