The bug in the provided function is caused by trying to access the same index twice in the script_parts list, even if it was already removed in the first try block. This causes an 'IndexError: pop index out of range' error.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the index of the element to be popped is still within the bounds of the list before attempting to remove it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except IndexError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except IndexError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test without the IndexError.
