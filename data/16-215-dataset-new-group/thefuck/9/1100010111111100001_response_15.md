In the buggy function `get_new_command`, the problem lies in removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the input command. The code tries to find the index of these options in the `command.script_parts` list, and if found, pops both the option and its argument. The issue here is that the second `pop` operation (i.e., `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`) would encounter an `IndexError` since the list index has already been modified in the first `pop` operation.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic around the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. We can keep track of the indexes to remove and then perform a single removal operation after finding both indexes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument if it's within the list

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function will handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument properly without encountering an `IndexError`. It should now pass the failing tests.
