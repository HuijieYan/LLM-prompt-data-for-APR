The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their corresponding arguments from the command, as the remaining arguments will be concatenated into the generated git command. However, the issue emerges from two potential sources:

1. The index of the `upstream_option` is incorrectly defined. If the script parts don't contain the `--set-upstream` flag, the index will remain -1 and command parts will be popped causing an `IndexError`.
2. The split operation using the newline character (`\n`) to extract the push upstream from the stderr might also lead to an `IndexError`.

The bug is causing an IndexError when handling command parts. The problem arises because when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments are not found in the `command.script_parts`, the index remains -1, and the pop operation is invoked with an invalid index causing an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, a strategy that can be employed is to first check for the presence of the flags within `command.script_parts` and then proceed with the removal operation. This can be done by checking if the index of the flags is not equal to -1 before performing the pop operations on `command.script_parts`. Additionally, checks can be added to ensure that there are enough stderr parts to split before attempting to access the `push_upstream` value.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    stderr_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_parts[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2] if len(stderr_parts) >= 3 else ''
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
