The buggy function is `get_new_command`. The function is meant to modify the command passed to it by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument, and replacing the 'push' argument with the value obtained from the `command.stderr` string.

The error occurs because the function is trying to pop an item from the `command.script_parts` list without checking if it exists, leading to an `IndexError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` may not be found in the `command.script_parts` list, but the function doesn't handle this case and still tries to remove items at the index.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before trying to remove the items.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function includes checks to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is not out of range before trying to pop items from the list. This should fix the `IndexError` that was occurring.
