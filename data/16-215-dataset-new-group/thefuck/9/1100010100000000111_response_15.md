## Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` seems to be incorrect as it removes elements from the list based on index, but it doesn't consider the subsequent shift of elements in the list after removing an element.
2. The extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` may not be accurate and could result in the wrong suggestion.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function is not properly handling the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the command, causing issues with the subsequent command generation. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` may not be accurate, leading to incorrect suggestions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument without affecting the subsequent elements in the list.
2. Ensure accurate extraction of `push_upstream` from the command's stderr to generate the correct command suggestion.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    cleaned_command = command.script_parts.copy()
    try:
        upstream_option_index = cleaned_command.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        cleaned_command.pop(upstream_option_index)
        cleaned_command.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        upstream_option_index = cleaned_command.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        cleaned_command.pop(upstream_option_index)
        cleaned_command.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(cleaned_command), 'push', push_upstream)
