The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to be related to the handling of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `git push` command. It looks like the function is intended to remove any occurrence of these options and their arguments from the command and replace the `push` argument with the actual remote and branch information obtained from the `stderr` of the command.

Upon closer inspection, the bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the index of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments in the `command.script_parts`. The code is not properly removing both the option and its argument when encountered, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for locating and removing the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. Additionally, we need to properly extract the remote and branch information from the `stderr` output.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Removing the --set-upstream and -u options and their arguments
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    for i, part in enumerate(script_parts):
        if part in ('--set-upstream', '-u'):
            script_parts.pop(i)
            if i < len(script_parts):
                script_parts.pop(i)  # Remove the argument as well

    # Extracting the remote and branch information from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replacing the 'push' argument with the actual remote and branch information
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return new_command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, as well as extract the remote and branch information from the `stderr` output.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values. Additionally, it should resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
