The bug in the function is that when it encounters the "--set-upstream" or "-u" flag, it does not remove the flag and its corresponding argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, it uses `command.stderr` to extract the required push upstream argument, but the expected push upstream does not correspond to the actual `command.stderr`. This has led to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" flag and its corresponding argument from `command.script_parts`. Then it should use a proper method to get the push upstream from the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If '--set-upstream' or '-u' are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in {'--set-upstream', '-u'}:
            command.script_parts.pop(i)
            if i < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(i)

    # Extract the required push upstream argument from the stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(stderr_lines):
        if line.startswith('    git push'):
            push_upstream = line[4:]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
