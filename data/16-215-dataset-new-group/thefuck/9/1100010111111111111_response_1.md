The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments from the command.script_parts list. This causes an IndexError when trying to pop the elements from the list if the options are not present. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are followed by an argument.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments, and replace the 'push' command with the one obtained from the stderr message.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Create a copy of the script_parts list

    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        try:
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
        except IndexError:
            pass  # Ignore if the index is out of range

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = 'git ' + push_upstream  # Reconstruct the new command

    return new_command
```

With the corrected function, it should now handle the cases where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options may or may not be followed by an argument, and it should correctly generate the new command based on the stderr message.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing tests pass.
