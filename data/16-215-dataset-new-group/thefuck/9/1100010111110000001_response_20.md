In the given buggy function, the first potential error is found in the try-except block where it attempts to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command parts list. However, after the code to find the index value, there is a line to remove the option from the list without any check if the indexes were found or not. This can lead to an IndexError as depicted in the error message.

The cause of the bug is that when the '-u' index was not found, it gets updated, overriding the previous value of the '--set-upstream' index. This causes both the options to be removed from the 'command.script_parts' list, leading to an `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to apply conditional checks on the indexes of both options and only remove them if they exist in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
	    upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        u_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if u_index != -1 and (upstream_option_index == -1 or u_index < upstream_option_index):
            upstream_option_index = u_index
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well, if present

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, the 'command.script_parts.pop' operations are under conditional checks based on the existence of valid indexes and the list length. This will prevent the 'IndexError' when the indexes are out of range.
