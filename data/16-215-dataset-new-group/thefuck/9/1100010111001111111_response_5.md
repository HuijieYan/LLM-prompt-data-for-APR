To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. 

One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. The logic for finding the index of these options and removing them is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the function is directly using the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object to extract the push suggestion, which may not be reliable in all cases.

To fix the bug:
- We should properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments by finding the correct index and removing them.
- We should parse the push suggestion from the `stderr` attribute more reliably, possibly using regex to extract the correct suggestion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    for opt in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if opt in command.script_parts:
            opt_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            command.script_parts.pop(opt_index)
            # Also remove the argument if it exists
            if opt_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(opt_index)

    # Extract the push suggestion from stderr
    match = re.search(r'git push (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # If no suggestion is found, return the original command
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected version properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. It also extracts the push suggestion from the `stderr` attribute more reliably using regex. This should address the issue and ensure that the function returns the correct new command based on the input.
