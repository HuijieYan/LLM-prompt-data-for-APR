The buggy function is `get_new_command` from the file `git_push.py`. The error message indicates that there is an IndexError at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` in the `get_new_command` function.

The cause of the bug is that after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, the check for the existence of `-u` option happens after the check for `--set-upstream` option. This causes the index of the `-u` option (if it exists) to be wrong if the `--set-upstream` exists before it. This leads to an incorrect indexing error during the pop operation.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `upstream_option_index` as `-1` separately for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` checks. Then, we should change the `if` conditions to separate `if` statements to properly remove the option and its argument.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function now handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments separately, preventing the IndexError issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
