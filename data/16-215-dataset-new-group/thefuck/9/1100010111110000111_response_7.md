The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. This causes the `IndexError: pop index out of range` error when trying to remove an element that is not present in the command.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks if `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them. This should resolve the `IndexError` issue and ensure that the function works as expected.
