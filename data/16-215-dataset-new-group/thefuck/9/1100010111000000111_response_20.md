The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly identifies and removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, leading to incorrect output. The issue on GitHub also confirms that the suggestions for `git push -u` are incorrect after a certain change was made (issue #538).

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then replace it with the correct suggestion.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        downstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        downstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = command.script_parts[:downstream_index] + ['push', push_upstream] + command.script_parts[downstream_index + 2:]
    return " ".join(new_command)
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass the failing test and provide the expected suggestions for `git push -u` based on the provided stderr information and the GitHub issue.
