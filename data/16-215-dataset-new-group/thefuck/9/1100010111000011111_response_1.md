Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Explanation:
- The potential error locations in the original function were the usage of `try-except` blocks to check for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts`. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the `-u` option was checked first and found, as the subsequent `try-except` block for `--set-upstream` would not execute.
- The cause of the bug was the incorrect handling of the upstream option index, which could lead to not removing the option when it was present in the command.
- To fix the bug, I replaced the `try-except` blocks with `if` and `elif` statements to properly check for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `command.script_parts`.
- Additionally, I changed the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` to `if upstream_option_index != -1` for checking the presence of the upstream option index.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
