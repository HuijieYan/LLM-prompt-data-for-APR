def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif "-u" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Explanation:
1. The original function had an issue with the way it attempted to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command's script parts. It used a try-except block to handle both cases, but if one case succeeded, it could still modify the 'upstream_option_index' even if the other case wasn't found. This was causing the IndexError.
2. The corrected function now uses if-elif conditions to separately check for '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command's script parts. This ensures that only one index is modified based on which option is found in the script parts.
3. Additionally, the corrected function uses 'if' instead of 'try-except' to check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command's script parts, which makes the code more explicit and easier to understand.

The above correction should address the bug, pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue.
