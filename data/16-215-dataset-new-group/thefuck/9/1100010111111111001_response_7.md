The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to modify a given command and append the required arguments for `git push` to set the upstream branch. However, there are errors in the logic due to incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.
2. The manipulation of the command.script_parts based on the found index.

The cause of the bug is due to mishandling the index of the options `--set-upstream` and `-u`. The errors occur when attempting to remove the options and their arguments by popping the script_parts list without properly updating the index. This results in an `IndexError` or incorrect removal of elements.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to correctly identify and handle the index of the options, then modify the script_parts list accordingly based on the found index.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Updated version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option itself
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove argument
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option itself
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, the script_parts list is modified only after properly handling the index of the options and removing both the option and its argument when found. This ensures that the options are correctly removed, and the expected outcome based on the input parameters is achieved.
