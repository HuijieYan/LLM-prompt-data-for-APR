The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove the `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list. This is happening because the buggy code attempts to remove the elements at the same index twice if both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present. 

The cause of the bug is as follows:
1. The function first checks for the index of `--set-upstream` and stores it in `upstream_option_index`.
2. Then, it checks for the index of `-u` and overwrites the `upstream_option_index` regardless of whether the `-u` option is present or not.
3. If the `-u` option is present, after removing the element at `upstream_option_index`, it again tries to remove the element at the same index, which causes the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the code should ensure that it only tries to remove an element if it exists at the specified index. Additionally, the logic for handling both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options needs to be revised.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the
    # command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` first, and if it's not found, then it checks for the presence of `-u`. It also ensures that the index is within the range of `command.script_parts` before attempting to remove an element.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
