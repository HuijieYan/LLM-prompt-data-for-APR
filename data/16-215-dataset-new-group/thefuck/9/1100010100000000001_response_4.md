The buggy function is designed to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the given command. The bug in the function is caused by the logic used to identify the index of the upstream option and then remove it from the command's script_parts.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Using "is not -1" instead of "!=" when checking the upstream_option_index.
2. Incorrectly identifying the index of the -u option and not handling it properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case for both --set-upstream and -u options. Additionally, the logic for removing the arguments is incorrect.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to:
1. Use "!=" instead of "is not -1" to check the upstream_option_index.
2. Use a condition to correctly identify the index of the -u option and remove it if present in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
