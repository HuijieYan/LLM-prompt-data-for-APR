The problem with the buggy `get_new_command` function is that it doesn't adequately handle cases when the `-u` argument is present in the git push command. The function attempts to index the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and then pop the indexed values, but there are scenarios where there's only one value to remove but the function attempts to remove it twice.

To fix the bug, the function should handle each condition separately and ensure that each indexed value is only removed once.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove '--set-upstream' and its argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This revised version of the function will handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, without causing any index out of range issues.
