The cause of the bug is that the `get_new_command` function does not correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command. This leads to incorrect suggestions being generated for the new command.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then replace the "push" with the actual argument received from the `git push` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    is_set_upstream = False
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        is_set_upstream = True
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        is_set_upstream = True

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = " ".join(command.script_parts)
    if is_set_upstream:
        new_command += f" --set-upstream {push_upstream}"
    return new_command
```

The key changes include:
1. Checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and removing them from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Checking a flag `is_set_upstream` to determine if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option was present in the original command.
3. Constructing the new command by joining the script parts and adding the `--set-upstream` option if it was originally present.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected command outputs.
