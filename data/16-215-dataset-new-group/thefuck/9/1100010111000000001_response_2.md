The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is supposed to modify a git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and then replacing the 'push' argument with the push upstream.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrectly using `is not -1` instead of `!= -1` to check if the upstream_option_index is found.
2. Incorrectly removing elements from the list of script_parts without considering the index after removing the first one.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use `!= -1` to check if the upstream_option_index is found.
2. Use `remove` method to remove elements from the list of script_parts based on the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('origin ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
