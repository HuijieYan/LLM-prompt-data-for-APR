The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The try-except block that attempts to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the script parts of the command.
2. The logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the script parts.
3. The extraction of push_upstream from the command stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the script parts, as well as the extraction of push_upstream from the command stderr.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Revisit the logic for finding the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the script parts, and ensure that it handles both cases correctly.
2. Correctly remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the script parts.
3. Ensure that push_upstream is extracted from the command stderr in a robust way.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument from the command script parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    # Extract push_upstream from the command stderr
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(error_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = error_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command script parts correctly, as well as extract push_upstream from the command stderr in a more robust way.
