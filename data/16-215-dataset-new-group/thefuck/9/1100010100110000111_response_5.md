The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an IndexError when attempting to pop an item from the command script_parts list. This IndexError is occurring because the code attempts to pop the same index twice after finding the position of the `-u` flag.

The bug is related to the changes introduced in issue #538, which broke the suggestions for `git push -u <remote>`. The user reported that the suggested command was not being generated correctly, and instead, it was suggesting the usage of `hub` instead of `git`.

To fix the bug, we should remove the -u flag from the command before obtaining the push_upstream string, which represents the suggested new command. Additionally, we should handle the case where the `-u` flag is not present in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the -u flag
        remote = command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the remote argument
    else:
        remote = 'origin'
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', f"--set-upstream {remote} {push_upstream}")
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the `-u` flag correctly and generate the correct suggestion for the `git push -u <remote>` case.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
