The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly removes the -u or --set-upstream option and its argument from the command script_parts. Also, the push_upstream variable is being assigned an incorrect value, which causes the function to return the wrong command.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the -u or --set-upstream option and its argument from the command, and then parse the correct push_upstream value from the stderr message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None
    
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
    remote_branch = command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of "--set-upstream" or "-u" in the command.script_parts and correctly removes it along with its argument. Then, it parses the correct push_upstream value from the stderr message and constructs the new command accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
