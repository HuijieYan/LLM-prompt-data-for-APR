The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are passed in a git push command. It attempts to remove the upstream options and their arguments from the command script parts, and then extract the argument to the `git push` command from the output of the command.

Potential Errors:
1. The `try-except` blocks are not correctly handling the assignment of the `upstream_option_index` variable, as the second `try` block always overwrites the result of the first.
2. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is incorrect. It should be `if upstream_option_index != -1`.
3. There is no check for the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the command script parts.
4. The logic to extract the `git push` command argument from the command's stderr may fail if the error message structure changes.

Cause of the Bug:
The potential errors mentioned above might cause the function to fail in removing the upstream options and extracting the `git push` command argument. This can lead to incorrect new commands being generated.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use an `if-else` structure to correctly handle the assignment of `upstream_option_index`.
2. Check for the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the command script parts before attempting to remove them.
3. Use robust error handling to extract the `git push` command argument from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for the presence of options and remove them from script parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the git push command argument from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
