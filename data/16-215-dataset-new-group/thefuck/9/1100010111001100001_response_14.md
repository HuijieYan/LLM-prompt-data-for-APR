The bug in the provided function is that it does not properly remove the upstream option and its argument if it's found in the `command.script_parts`. It also does not properly extract the value of the `push_upstream` variable from the `command.stderr`. Lastly, the function does not replace the `push` argument with the correct value extracted from `command.stderr` if it contains `--set-upstream`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly remove the `--set-upstream` (or `-u`) and its argument if found in the `command.script_parts`. Then extract the correct value from `command.stderr` to update the `push_upstream` variable, and replace the `push` argument with this value if it contains `--set-upstream`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    return new_command
```

With the corrected version, the failing tests should now pass.
