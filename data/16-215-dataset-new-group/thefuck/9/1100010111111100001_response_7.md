To fix this buggy function, we need to address the IndexError that occurs due to the 'pop' function removing items from the list that do not exist. We also need to fix the logic to correctly find the push information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This version of the function uses the 'remove' function to remove the specified arguments if they exist, without causing any IndexError. Additionally, we have updated the logic to correctly find the push information from the stderr by splitting it and extracting the last part.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
