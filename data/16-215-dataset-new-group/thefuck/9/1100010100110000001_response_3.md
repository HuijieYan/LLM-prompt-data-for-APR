The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the new command to fix the user's mistake of pushing a branch without an upstream.

The error message indicates that the bug is causing an IndexError when attempting to pop an item at a specific index, which suggests that the calculated index may be out of range.

The bug occurs because the code is checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, but overwrites `upstream_option_index` when checking for `-u`. This causes the second `pop` operation to use an invalid index, resulting in the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to properly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function checks for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and ensures that the `pop` operations are only performed if the options are actually found in the list of `script_parts`. This should address the IndexError that was previously occurring.
