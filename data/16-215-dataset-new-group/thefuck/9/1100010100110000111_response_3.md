The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect handling of the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument. This results in an IndexError when trying to remove an element from the command.script_parts list.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument, and also extract the correct push_upstream command from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = ""
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.split()[-2] + " " + line.split()[-1]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function will correctly handle the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument, and extract the push_upstream command from the stderr.
