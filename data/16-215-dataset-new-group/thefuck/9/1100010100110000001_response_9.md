The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is used to modify the command for pushing to a remote git repository.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the index manipulation for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' elements from the `command.script_parts`, and the extraction of the upstream branch from the error message.

The cause of the bug is that the code tries to remove the same index twice from `command.script_parts` when the '-u' option is detected in the command, resulting in an `IndexError` in this case.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to use the `remove` method for Python lists to remove the first occurrence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' if the option is found, thus preventing the possibility of an `IndexError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test by handling the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' properly.
