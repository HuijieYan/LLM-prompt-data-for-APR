The buggy function is failing to handle the case where the `-u` option is passed to the `git push` command, resulting in an `IndexError: pop index out of range` error. This error occurs when the function attempts to remove the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, but the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to address the issue with removing the `-u` option and its argument from the command. We also need to properly handle the case where the `git push` command is run with the `-u` option.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('origin')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    elif '-u' in command.script:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, '-u', '') + f' --set-upstream {push_upstream}'
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `--set-upstream` option is in the `command.script_parts`. If it is, we remove it along with its argument. Then, we extract the upstream branch from the error message and use it to construct the new command.

If the `-u` option is in the command, we extract the upstream branch and construct the new command with the `--set-upstream` option.

These changes will fix the bug and ensure that the function works as expected for both cases.
