To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The function is trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option from the `command.script_parts`, but it does so incorrectly, resulting in an `IndexError`.
2. The function then tries to extract the suggested git push command from the `command.stderr`, but it does not handle different scenarios correctly.

To address these issues, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from the command
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove(option)

    # Extract the suggested git push command from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    suggestion = None
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push'):
            suggestion = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break
    
    # If no suggestion is found, use a default value
    push_upstream = suggestion if suggestion else 'origin master'
    
    # Construct the new command with the corrected upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these modifications, the function now removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` correctly and handles different scenarios when extracting the suggested git push command from the `command.stderr`.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
