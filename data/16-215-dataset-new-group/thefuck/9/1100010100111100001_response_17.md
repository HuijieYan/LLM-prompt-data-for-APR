The bug in the `git_push` function is causing an `IndexError`, stating that the pop index is out of range. This error occurs when trying to remove an item from an empty list using `.pop()`. This bug occurs because when `-u` option is used, the `upstream_option_index` for `'-u'` is set to 2, and then `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called. This pop method should be called only once to remove the current branch and set the remote as upstream, but the second `.pop()` call happens regardless of whether the item was removed yet. 

To fix the bug, you should replace the lines:
```python
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
with:
```python
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

Here is the corrected version of the `git_push` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
