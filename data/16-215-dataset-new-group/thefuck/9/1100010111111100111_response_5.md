The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The function is also incorrectly extracting the push upstream suggestion from the stderr.

The cause of the bug is that when trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument, the function is not correctly handling the index to remove from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the push upstream suggestion from `command.stderr` is incorrect, which causes the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to first correctly handle the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from the command. Then, we need to extract the push upstream suggestion from `command.stderr` in a more reliable way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_index = -1

    if upstream_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')[-1].split('git push --set-upstream ')[1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected version of the function, the failing test should pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved. The function now correctly handles the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument, and also correctly extracts the push upstream suggestion from `command.stderr`.
