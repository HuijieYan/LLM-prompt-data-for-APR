The buggy function has several issues that cause it to fail the test cases. The main problem is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command's script parts and not retrieving the correct value for `push_upstream`.

The `get_new_command` function returns an incorrect command after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the input command's script parts. Additionally, the `push_upstream` value is extracted incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and extract the correct `push_upstream` value.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and retrieves the correct value for `push_upstream`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub regarding the incorrect suggestions for `git push -u` commands.
