The bug in the function seems to be related to removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument without considering its argument and processing the git command for a new command. The function then performs processing on the output to replace the 'push' command with a modified one. However, the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument from the command is causing issues as seen from the runtime values and outputs.

The main problem lies in the section where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments are removed. The removal logic is incorrect and does not handle the arguments correctly. There is also inconsistency in how the '--set-upstream' and '-u' cases are handled, leading to missed edge cases, and index out of range issues.

To fix the bug, the function can be revised to properly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments and their corresponding arguments and then carry out subsequent processing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return

    del command_parts[upstream_index:upstream_index+2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    new_command = command_parts.copy()
    new_command[0] = push_upstream
    return " ".join(new_command)
```

In this corrected version, the function first identifies the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command parts. Then, it removes the corresponding arguments, including the flag itself, from the command parts using slicing. After that, it processes the output to create a new command with the modified 'push' command.

By applying these changes, the function should now handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and their arguments correctly and generate the new command based on the processed output.
