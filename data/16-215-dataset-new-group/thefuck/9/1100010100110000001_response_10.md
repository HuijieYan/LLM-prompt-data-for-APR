The buggy function, `get_new_command`, is designed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command string. It then extracts the upstream information from the stderr and replaces the push argument in the command string with the newly extracted upstream information.

The error message is an `IndexError` and shows that the error is occurring in the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` within the `get_new_command` function.

The cause of the bug is that if the `'-u'` or `'--set-upstream'` option is found in the `command.script_parts`, it is being popped twice - once for removing the option and once for removing its argument if it exists. This results in the `IndexError` when trying to pop the value again that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we should not pop the `upstream_option_index` twice. If the option is found, pop it once and then check if its argument exists before popping it again.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Check if there is another item to pop
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks for the existence of the second item before popping it from `command.script_parts`. This ensures that the `IndexError` is addressed and the function can operate correctly.
