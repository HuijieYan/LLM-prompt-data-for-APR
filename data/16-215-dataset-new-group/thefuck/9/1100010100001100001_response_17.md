In the given buggy function, we've identified a number of potential issues:

1. The 'upstream_option_index' variable is incorrectly overwritten with the last occurrence of '-u' in the 'command.script_parts' list. This will not capture the correct index for the '--set-upstream' flag.
2. The subsequent logic to pop elements from the 'command.script_parts' list based on the incorrect index for the '--set-upstream' flag could lead to incorrect behavior and could potentially raise an error.
3. The 'push_upstream' variable is extracted from the incorrect location in the 'command.stderr' string, leading to an incorrect result.

The buggy function's main issues are caused by:
- Incorrectly finding and handling the index for the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags in the 'command.script_parts' list.
- Incorrectly extracting the 'push_upstream' value from the 'command.stderr' string.

To address these issues, we can follow a strategy of:
- Correctly finding the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags in the 'command.script_parts' list.
- Extracting the 'push_upstream' value from the 'command.stderr' string using a more reliable approach.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the identified issues:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Correctly finding the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags in the command.script_parts list
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extracting the push_upstream value from the command.stderr string using a reliable approach
    push_upstream = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')[-2].split(' ')[-2:]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
```
In the corrected function:
- We correctly find the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag by using the 'in' keyword to check for the presence of the flags in the 'command.script_parts' list and then using the 'index' method to obtain the index.
- We extract the 'push_upstream' value based on the expected pattern from the 'command.stderr' string, which is the 2nd to last line and the last two space-separated words.

Applying the provided fix should address the issues and enable the function to work correctly.
