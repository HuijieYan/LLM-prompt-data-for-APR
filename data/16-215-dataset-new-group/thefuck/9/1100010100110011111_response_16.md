The bug in the function is caused by the attempt to pop the same index twice from the command.script_parts list. This is because "upstream_option_index" is being used to remove both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options from the list of script parts, but it only stores the index of the last option found.

To fix the bug, we need to identify and remove both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options independently. Then we should extract the correct upstream branch from the stderr message and use it to replace the 'push' argument in the git command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the correct push upstream command from the stderr message
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split('use\n')[1].strip()

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function will remove the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options from the command.script_parts list if present, then extract the correct push upstream command from the stderr message and use it to replace the 'push' argument in the git command.

This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test case, as well as satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issues posted on GitHub.
