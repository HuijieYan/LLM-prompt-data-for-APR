The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, it extracts the push command from the `command.stderr` incorrectly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to:
1. Correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts`.
2. Extract the push command from the `command.stderr` in a more robust way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()

    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for i, part in enumerate(script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            script_parts.pop(i)
            if i < len(script_parts):
                script_parts.pop(i)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip()
    push_command = " ".join(script_parts)
    return replace_argument(push_command, 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument properly, and extract the push command from the `command.stderr` in a robust way.
