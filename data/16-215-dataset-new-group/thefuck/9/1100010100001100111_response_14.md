The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command. The `upstream_option_index` is being incorrectly used to index and remove the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the `push_upstream` is incorrectly extracted from the `command.stderr` based on the assumption that it will always be the third last line, which is not reliable.

To fix the bug, we need to first extract the correct `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr` based on the error message. Then, we should check if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is present in the `command.script_parts` before removing it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Extract the correct push_upstream from the command.stderr
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = ''
    for line in reversed(error_lines):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            break

    # Check if --set-upstream or -u is present in the script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Replace the push command with the correct push_upstream
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract the `push_upstream` from the error message and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument only if it is present in the `command.script_parts`.
