The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an IndexError when the '-u' flag is passed to the `git push` command. This is because the code is trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list that does not exist, resulting in the IndexError.

The cause of the bug is that the code is trying to pop elements from `command.script_parts` without checking if the elements exist. Additionally, the logic for determining the `push_upstream` value is incorrect as it doesn't handle the case where the branch name contains spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options, and improve the logic for extracting the correct `push_upstream` value.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None  # No action needed

    script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
    script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove its argument

    # Find the correct push_upstream value
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split('use')[1].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options correctly and extract the `push_upstream` value properly.

This revised function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
