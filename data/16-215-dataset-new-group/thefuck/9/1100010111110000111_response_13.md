The buggy function get_new_command has the following issues:
1. It doesn't handle the case where the command doesn't contain '--set-upstream' or '-u' options properly.
2. It tries to pop elements from the command.script_parts list without checking if they exist.

The cause of the bug is that when the command doesn't contain '--set-upstream' or '-u' options, it still tries to pop elements from the command.script_parts list, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options exist in the command, and then remove them from the command.script_parts list if they do. Additionally, we need to handle the case where these options do not exist in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if '--set-upstream' or '-u' options exist in the command, and removes them if they do. Then it retrieves the push upstream from the stderr and constructs the new command accordingly.

This should resolve the IndexError issue and ensure that the function works as expected.
