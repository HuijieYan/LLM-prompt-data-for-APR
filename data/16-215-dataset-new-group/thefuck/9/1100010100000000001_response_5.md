The buggy function is designed to parse the command used to push a Git commit to a remote repository and modify it to include the upstream branch information. The function has multiple issues that need to be addressed.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The attempt to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. The conditional check for `upstream_option_index` being not equal to -1.
3. The use of `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` to remove the elements.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list based on the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. The indexing and removal of elements are not handled properly, leading to potential index errors and incorrect modification of the command.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in a safer manner.
2. Ensure that the index manipulation and removal operations on the `command.script_parts` list are done correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u if present in the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the push upstream branch information
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace the argument with the updated push command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, the function directly checks for the presence of '--set-upstream' and '-u' using `in` operator and removes them from `command.script_parts` if found. This approach is more reliable and less prone to index errors. Additionally, the code to extract the upstream branch information and replace the push command remains unchanged.
