The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script, and then extract the `git push` command from the stderr and replace the corresponding argument. However, the bug lies in the way the upstream option is removed. When removing the option and its argument, the code currently removes the option and then shifts the argument index, resulting in the removal of the wrong element. Additionally, the function always assumes that the `git push` command will be present in the stderr at the second last position.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly identify and remove the upstream option and its argument. It should also extract the `git push` command from the stderr in a more robust way.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u option and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in script_parts:
            index = script_parts.index(option)
            if index + 1 < len(script_parts):
                script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
                script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument
    
    # Extract git push command from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines[::-1]:  # Reverse search to find the last occurrence
        if 'git push' in line:
            push_command = line.split('git push', 1)[1].strip()
            break
    else:  # If no git push command is found in stderr
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)  # Return original command
    
    # Replace the argument in the script with the extracted git push command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_command)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly removes the upstream option and its argument from the command script and extracts the `git push` command from the stderr in a more robust way. It should now pass the failing test provided.
