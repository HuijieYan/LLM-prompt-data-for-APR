The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing the index error when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list. This is happening because the code does not handle the case where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the command.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    pop_indices = []
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            pop_indices.extend([option_index, option_index + 1])
    
    for index in sorted(pop_indices, reverse=True):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately, and then removes both the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This ensures that the index error does not occur when popping elements from the list.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue mentioned in GitHub.
