The cause of the bug is that the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line is trying to pop the same index twice which results in the second attempt to pop an index that's out of range, leading to an IndexError.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to check the length of `command.script_parts` after the first pop and then only pop again if the length is still more than the index being popped.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # First pop
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check length before second pop
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Second pop
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should handle the popping of elements from `command.script_parts` more responsibly, avoiding the IndexError.
