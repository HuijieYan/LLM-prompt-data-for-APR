The cause of the bug is that the `pop` method attempts to remove items from the `command.script_parts` list at the same index twice, which leads to an `IndexError` when the `-u` option is used. This is due to the fact that the index of `-u` is being found but then not used to remove the option from the list.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the `-u` option from the list, and also update the logic to handle the `--set-upstream` option properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from the list
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the argument of the option
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the above changes, the function should now correctly remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and handle the error message to obtain the correct command for `git push`. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
