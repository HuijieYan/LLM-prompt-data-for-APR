The potential error location within the buggy function is likely at the point where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called. The error message indicates that there is an IndexError: pop index out of range, which means that the index being passed as an argument to the pop method is out of range.

The cause of the bug is that when the `'-u'` flag is present in the command, it removes both `'-u'` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. However, when both are removed, the index for the `'-u'` flag becomes out of range, resulting in the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `'-u'` flag and its argument are removed separately, and also validate that the index is in range before removing the items from the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index_short = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index_short = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    elif upstream_option_index_short != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_short)
        if upstream_option_index_short < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_short)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
