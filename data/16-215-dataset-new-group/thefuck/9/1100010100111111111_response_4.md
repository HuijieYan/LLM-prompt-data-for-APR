The cause of the bug is that the code is not properly handling the case when the `-u` option is passed to the `git push` command. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access a non-existent index in the `command.script_parts` list.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the case when the `-u` option is present and remove it from the command before processing further.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and ensuring that the correct index is removed from the `command.script_parts` list, we can resolve the `IndexError` and handle the `-u` option properly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
