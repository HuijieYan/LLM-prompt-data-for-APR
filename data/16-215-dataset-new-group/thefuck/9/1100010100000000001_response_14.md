The buggy function is designed to handle the `git push` command and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The function then takes the remaining arguments and suggests a new command using the `replace_argument` function.

Potential errors in the buggy function:

1. The try-except block that attempts to find the index of the `--set-upstream` option will not work correctly because if the `--set-upstream` option is not found, the variable `upstream_option_index` is set to -1. Thus, the check `upstream_option_index is not -1` may not work as intended.
2. The same issue exists with the try-except block for the `-u` option.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `upstream_option_index is not -1` will not be triggered based on how the index search is handled and the way the condition is evaluated.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change how the upstream_option_index is initialized and set the condition for the if statement correctly.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    upstream_option_index_flag = False
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        upstream_option_index_flag = True
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        upstream_option_index_flag = True

    if upstream_option_index_flag:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
