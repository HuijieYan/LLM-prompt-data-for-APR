The cause of the bug is that the `pop` method is being called twice on the `command.script_parts` list in the buggy function, which leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range. This is caused by the incorrect logic in handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before trying to remove the elements from the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Only pop if the index is valid after the first pop
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will no longer throw an `IndexError` and will provide the correct output based on the input. This should solve the failing test cases and address the GitHub issues mentioned.
