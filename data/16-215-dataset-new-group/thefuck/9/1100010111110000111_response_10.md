Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs when the `command.script_parts.pop()` method is called with an index that is out of range. This is causing the IndexError to be raised, leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the index `upstream_option_index` is checked for being within the range of the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove elements from it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove -u
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we use a try-except block to handle the case where the index is not found in the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we remove both the option and its argument if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
