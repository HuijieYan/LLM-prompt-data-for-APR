The issue seems to be related to the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u origin` and this is caused by the buggy function `get_new_command` in the `git_push.py` file.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The code is trying to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in `command.script_parts`, but it is not handling both cases correctly. If the first try block doesn't find `--set-upstream`, the second try block won't be executed, leading to incorrect index assignment.

2. The subsequent code is removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from `command.script_parts`, but it is not handling the case where the option and its argument are removed from different indices.

Based on the GitHub issue and the details provided, the strategy to fix the bug would be:
1. Correctly handle both cases of finding the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in `command.script_parts` and handle the scenario where the specified options are not found.
2. Ensure that the code properly removes both the option and its argument from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    # Get the push command suggested by git
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
With these changes, the corrected function should handle both cases of finding the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, and properly remove the option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
