## Correction
Based on the analysis, the main issue in the buggy function is in how it handles the `upstream_option_index` variable and the pop operations on the `command.script_parts` list. The function is incorrectly attempting to remove items from the list directly without checking for the length and existence of the items. This is causing the IndexError in some cases.

To fix the bug, the buggy function should be corrected to first check the existence and length of the `upstream_option_index` before attempting to remove items from the list. Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1 and len(command.script_parts) >= (upstream_option_index + 2):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Second pop should remove the argument
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected function, it checks the length and existence of the items in `command.script_parts` before attempting to remove them. This will prevent the IndexError and properly handle the presence of the `-u` and `--set-upstream` options.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases, as it ensures that the correct elements are removed from the `command.script_parts` list based on the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.
