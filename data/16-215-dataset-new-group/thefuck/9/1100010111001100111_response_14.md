The buggy function fails to handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is used with additional arguments, causing it to incorrectly remove these options and their arguments from the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not take into account the scenario where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is used with extra arguments. This results in the removal of these options and their arguments, leading to an incorrect command being generated.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is used with additional arguments. We should only remove the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` if it occurs in the list. Then, we should extract the correct push remote and branch from the `command.stderr` and generate the new command accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument if they occur in the command
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Only remove the argument if it exists
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the correct push remote and branch from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix in place, the function should now correctly handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is used with additional arguments, generating the correct new command. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
