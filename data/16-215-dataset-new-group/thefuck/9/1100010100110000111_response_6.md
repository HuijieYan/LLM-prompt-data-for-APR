The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the '-u' option in the git push command. The function is trying to remove both the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options from the command, but it is not accounting for the fact that the '-u' option may not have an argument immediately following it. This leads to an IndexError when trying to remove the option using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the removal of the '-u' option and its argument (if it exists) from the command script parts. We can also simplify the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument if present
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(index)
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('-u')
        try:
            command_parts.pop(index + 1)  # remove the argument if exists
        except IndexError:
            pass
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should properly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command and provide the expected result.
