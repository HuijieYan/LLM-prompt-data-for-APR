The buggy function has a few issues, including the incorrect handling of the --set-upstream and -u options, as well as an incorrect extraction of the push_upstream value from the command.stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying and removing the --set-upstream or -u options from the script_parts list, and the extraction of push_upstream is not correctly capturing the suggested git push command from the command.stderr.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify and remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the command.script_parts list and extract the push_upstream value from the command.stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-3:]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
```

With the corrected version, the function should now correctly remove the --set-upstream or -u options from the command.script_parts list and extract the push_upstream value from the command.stderr. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
