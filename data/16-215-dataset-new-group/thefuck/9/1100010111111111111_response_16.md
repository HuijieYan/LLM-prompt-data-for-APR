The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing the failing test due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an item from `command.script_parts` list.

The root cause of the bug is that the index of the item to pop is not adjusted correctly after the first pop operation. This leads to an incorrect index being used for the second pop operation, which results in the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should update the index of the item to pop after the first pop operation, or combine the two pop operations into a single statement. 

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix resolves the issue mentioned in GitHub.
