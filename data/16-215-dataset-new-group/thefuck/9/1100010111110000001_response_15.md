The buggy function is `get_new_command`. It appears to extract the upstream branch from the stderr and embed it into a new git push command.

The failing test checks if the result of `get_new_command` matches the expected output. The failing test and error message indicate that the problem occurs when the script attempts to execute `get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))`, as it throws an IndexError. This points to an issue with the manipulation of the command's `script_parts`.

The cause of the bug is an incorrect sequence of operations when handling the `script_parts`, particularly when `-u` or `--set-upstream` are removed. It leads to the IndexError in the subsequent logic.

To fix the bug, there's a need to adjust the sequence of manipulations of the `script_parts` to ensure that removing `-u` or `--set-upstream` and the corresponding argument does not lead to an invalid index when accessing elements of `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the upstream branch from the command's stderr needs to be checked for potential issues.

Here's a corrected version of `get_new_command`:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        while '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        while '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the potential issues by using a while loop to ensure proper removal of `-u` and `--set-upstream` and their corresponding arguments. Additionally, it retains the logic for extracting the upstream branch from stderr and embedding it into the new git push command. The corrected version should resolve the IndexError issue and pass the failing test.
