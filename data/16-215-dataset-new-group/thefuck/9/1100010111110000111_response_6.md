### Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the git push command and then replace it with the push upstream branch. However, there are several issues in the function:
1. The index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not being correctly removed from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. The `push_upstream` is extracted from the stderr in an incorrect manner.

The failing test is due to the incorrect behavior of the `get_new_command` function when handling the `-u` option in the `git push` command.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `IndexError: pop index out of range` due to incorrect removal of the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` from `command.script_parts` list, and the incorrect extraction of `push_upstream` from the command stderr. This leads to the failing test and the reported GitHub issues regarding suggestions for `git push -u` with a specific branch.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the following approach should be taken:
1. Correctly identify and remove both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Correctly extract the `push_upstream` from the stderr by splitting and extracting the necessary information.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from the command
    command.script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    
    # Extract push upstream branch from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function addresses the issues and corrects the extraction of the push upstream branch from the stderr. This version should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issues.
