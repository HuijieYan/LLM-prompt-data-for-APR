To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The logic for removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the command is incorrect.
2. The function fails to handle the case where the provided command already contains the `--set-upstream` option.

The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function is provided below:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None  # No need to modify the command

    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
    if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version fixes the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. It also checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` in the command and handles it appropriately.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect suggestions for `git push -u` commands.
