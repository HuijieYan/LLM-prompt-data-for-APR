Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The use of 'is' instead of '!=' to compare the 'upstream_option_index'.
2. Incorrect use of 'pop' to remove two elements instead of just one.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by using 'is' instead of '!=' for comparing the 'upstream_option_index' variable, and using 'pop' method twice to remove two arguments instead of just one.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use '!=' instead of 'is' for comparing the 'upstream_option_index' to fix the comparison issue.
2. Use the 'pop' method once to remove only one argument as intended.

The corrected version of the function has been provided above.
