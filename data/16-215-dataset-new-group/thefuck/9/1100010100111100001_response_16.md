The buggy function `get_new_command` has an issue where it is trying to pop from the `command.script_parts` list without proper bounds checking. This leads to an `IndexError` as observed in the failing test. The issue arises when an argument to be removed is not present in the list, and the function tries to access `-1` index.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if the `upstream_option_index` is `-1` before attempting to pop from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Check if the option was found
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if the option was found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Safe to pop at the index
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index is within bounds
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1` before popping or accessing `command.script_parts`, ensuring that any modifications are performed with proper bounds checking.
