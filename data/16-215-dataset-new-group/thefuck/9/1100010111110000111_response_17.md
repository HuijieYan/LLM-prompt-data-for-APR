The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when attempting to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts`.

The cause of the bug is that the code is attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list without first checking if those elements exist. This results in the IndexError when trying to `pop` an index that is out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to add checks to ensure that the elements `-u` or `--set-upstream` exist in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove them.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the elements '--set-upstream' or '-u' exist in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them. If they exist, we remove them from the list. After that, the function continues as before to generate the new command based on the `push_upstream` value.

With this correction, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
