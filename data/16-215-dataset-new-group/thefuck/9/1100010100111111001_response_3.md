### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is trying to identify the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command and then remove it from the command's arguments. However, there are a few issues:
1. The code does not correctly handle the case when '-u' is not present.
2. When removing the option and its argument, the code removes the same index twice, resulting in an `IndexError`.
3. The `push_upstream` value is not being extracted correctly from the command's stderr.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Handle the case when '-u' is not present before trying to remove it.
2. Remove the correct index only once to avoid an `IndexError`.
3. Extract the `push_upstream` value correctly from the command's stderr.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts): # check if there are enough elements to remove the argument as well
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
