### Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. The function erroneously removed these elements without checking if they exist and if there are additional arguments to remove.

To fix the bug, the corrected function first checks if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts`, and if so, it removes it along with its argument. Additionally, it checks if there are more arguments to remove after removing the upstream option and its argument.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub regarding the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u origin`.

By using a boolean flag `upstream_option_removed`, the function now keeps track of whether the upstream option was removed. This allows for better control of the removal process, ensuring that it only happens when the option is present.

The corrected function also checks if there are more arguments in `command.script_parts` after removing the upstream option and its argument, addressing the issue of incomplete removal.
