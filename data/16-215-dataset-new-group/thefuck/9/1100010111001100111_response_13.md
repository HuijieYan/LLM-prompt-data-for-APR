The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it always returns "git push --set-upstream origin master" regardless of the input. This is because the function is not properly handling the cases where the command includes `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check for the presence of these arguments and handle them accordingly. We can also extract the `push_upstream` value from the stderr message, as it contains the correct information about the upstream branch.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    new_command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    if '--set-upstream' in new_command_parts:
        upstream_option_index = new_command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        new_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        new_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    if '-u' in new_command_parts:
        upstream_option_index = new_command_parts.index('-u')
        new_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should address the issue and provide the correct output for the failing test cases.
