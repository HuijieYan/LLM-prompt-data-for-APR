The buggy function is trying to extract the value after `git` from the error message, and then construct a new command by replacing the `push` argument with the extracted value. The function fails with an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when it tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function goes ahead to pop the `upstream_option_index` without checking if it's within the range of the list. This leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, we should check if the `upstream_option_index` is within the range of the list before attempting to pop it from the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
