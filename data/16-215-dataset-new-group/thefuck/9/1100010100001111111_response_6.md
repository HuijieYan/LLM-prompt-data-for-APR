The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly identifies and removes the --set-upstream or -u option from the command, regardless of its position in the script_parts list. This results in the incorrect removal of the option and its argument from the command.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument separately, and then remove them from the command as necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the --set-upstream or -u option
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we first try to find the index of --set-upstream, and if that fails, we try to find the index of -u. If either option is found, we then check if there is an argument to be removed as well. We also added a condition to check if there are enough elements in the command.script_parts list to safely remove the option and its argument.

This corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should resolve the issue and provide the expected output for all the test cases.
