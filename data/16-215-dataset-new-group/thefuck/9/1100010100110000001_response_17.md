The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" indicates that the `pop` method is called on an index that does not exist in the list. 

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the `pop` method is being called twice on the same index, causing it to throw an IndexError.


To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code is removing the elements at the correct index and without raising an IndexError. One way to do this is to keep track of the indexes of the detected options and then remove them in reverse order to avoid changing the index value of other options when the first one is removed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should work correctly without raising an IndexError.
