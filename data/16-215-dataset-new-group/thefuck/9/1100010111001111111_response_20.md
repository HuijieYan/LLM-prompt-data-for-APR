To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect extraction of the push upstream branch from the error message. Based on the failing tests and the expected input/output values, it is clear that the function is not correctly extracting the upstream branch from the error message and creating the new command.

The current approach to extract the push upstream branch from the error message is not effective. The `push_upstream` variable does not correctly represent the upstream branch that needs to be added to the new command. 

To fix this bug, a better approach is to extract the correct upstream branch from the error message using a regex pattern to match the branch name, and then construct the new command using the extracted branch name.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_branch_match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (.+)', command.stderr)
    if upstream_branch_match:
        upstream_branch = upstream_branch_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', upstream_branch)
    else:
        # If there's no match for the upstream branch, return the original command
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

With this correction, the function correctly extracts the upstream branch from the error message and constructs the new command based on it. This should now satisfy the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
