The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The if condition for checking if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 is incorrect, it should be `if upstream_option_index != -1`.
2. The pop method is used to remove items from the `command.script_parts` list, but it is used incorrectly and can potentially cause an index out of range error.
3. The `push_upstream` variable is being assigned the value of `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`, which might not be accurately capturing the intended value from the stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_new_command` function is not correctly handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `git push` command. This is causing it to fail the test cases provided, as it is not generating the correct new command based on the input.

To fix the bug in the function, the `upstream_option_index` variable can be set separately for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. Then, instead of using the pop method, the slice assignment can be used to remove the specific items from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the `push_upstream` value can be obtained by using a more reliable method to parse the intended value from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should now handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and pass the failing test cases.
