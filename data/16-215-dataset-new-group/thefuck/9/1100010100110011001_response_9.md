### Analysis
The buggy function aims to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" flag and its argument from the command, and then construct a new command using the remaining parts along with the output from stderr. The bug appears to be at the point where it removes the elements from `command.script_parts` using `pop`, resulting in an `IndexError`.

The expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return are:
- `upstream_option_index`: `-1` (int)
- `push_upstream`: `'push --set-upstream origin master'` (str)

### Bug
The bug is caused due to an incorrect index being used with `pop` which results in an IndexError.

### Fix
The strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the index being used with `pop` is checked for validity before performing the operation.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
