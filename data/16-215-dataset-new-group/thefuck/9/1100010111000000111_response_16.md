The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options, which is causing the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly identify and remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the command, and then replace the "push" argument with the correct push upstream value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_arg_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_arg_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_arg_index)

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_arg_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_arg_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_arg_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `-u` and `--set-upstream` options correctly and provide the expected output for the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue.
