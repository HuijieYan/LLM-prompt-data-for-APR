The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and their corresponding argument from the `command.script_parts` and replace the push command with the argument received from `command.stderr`. 

The buggy function is throwing an IndexError because both `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` and `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` are being executed, which indicates that `upstream_option_index` is not correctly calculated.

The buggy function is not correctly identifying the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`. This leads to an incorrect list index for the `pop()` operation, resulting in the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we should update and redefine the `upstream_option_index` correctly based on the new conditions. Below is a corrected version of the function based on the analysis:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Removed a single element
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # We need to remove the next element after removing the previous element

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
