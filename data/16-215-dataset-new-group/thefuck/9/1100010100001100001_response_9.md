The bug in the function arises from the following code block:
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The issue is that in the last line of the code block, `pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice, rather than a single time for each instance of `upstream_option_index`. This causes an error because it tries to pop the same index position twice, which leads to an incorrect list. 

To fix the bug, you should change the condition to `if upstream_option_index >= 0` and update the following lines:
```python
if upstream_option_index >= 0:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

This change ensures that the correct number of times the pop function is executed based on the value of `upstream_option_index`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
