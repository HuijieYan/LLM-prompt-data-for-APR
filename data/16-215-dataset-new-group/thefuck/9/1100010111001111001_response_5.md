## The buggy function
The function `get_new_command` is designed to handle the `git push` command. It's meant to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command and replace it with the actual push upstream command obtained from the stderr output. 

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is not being correctly set to the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`. 
2. The code to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument is incorrect.
3. The extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr might not be working as intended.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug seems to originate from the extraction of the push upstream command from the `stderr`. The code is not retrieving the correct information from the `stderr` and is not correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the `script_parts`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Validate the stderr output to ensure that the correct information is being extracted.
2. Ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is being correctly set to the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
3. Correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the `script_parts`, if present.
4. Replace the `push` command with the one obtained from the `stderr`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        index = -1
    
    if index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(index)  # remove the flag
        script_parts.pop(index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = " ".join(script_parts)
    new_command = f"git {push_upstream} {new_command.partition('git push ')[2]}"
    return new_command
```
