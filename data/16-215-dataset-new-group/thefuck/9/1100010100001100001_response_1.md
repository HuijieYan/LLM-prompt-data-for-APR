It seems that the buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command, and then concatenate the remaining arguments onto the command.

The potential error location seems to be at the condition to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1, which is used to remove the option and its argument from the `script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the intended push upstream from the `stderr` appears to have issues as well.

The cause of the bug is that the `pop` function is called twice on the `command.script_parts` for both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options regardless of their existence. This can lead to incorrect modifications to the list.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to use the correct index for popping the elements from `command.script_parts`, and to properly extract the intended push upstream from the `stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-3:]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the options `-u` and `--set-upstream` exist in the `command.script_parts` before trying to remove them. Then, we correctly extract the intended push upstream from the `stderr` message.
