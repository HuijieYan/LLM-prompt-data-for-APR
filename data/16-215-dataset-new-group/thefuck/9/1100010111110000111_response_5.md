The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an IndexError when trying to pop items from the `command.script_parts` list. This is happening because the index to be popped is being calculated incorrectly, resulting in an out of range error.

The cause of the bug is that the index used for popping elements from `command.script_parts` is being set incorrectly. The logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not properly handling the case when one of them is not present in the command.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly find the index of `-u` or `--set-upstream` in the command and handle the case when they are not present.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return command.script

    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index].startswith('origin'):
        push_upstream = command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'  # default value if origin is not mentioned

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function now handles the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` may not be present in the command. It also properly handles the case when the upstream does not start with 'origin', providing the default value 'origin master'.

This should resolve the IndexError and pass the failing test cases.
