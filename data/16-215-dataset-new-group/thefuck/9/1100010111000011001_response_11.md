The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it does not properly handle the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` are included in the command `script_parts`. It also does not correctly extract the git push command from the `stderr` output.

The expected behavior is to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` if they are present in the command, and then extract the git push command from the `stderr` output and use it to replace the original push command.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` are included in the command `script_parts`, and extract the correct git push command from the `stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split('git ')[-1].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` are included in the command `script_parts`, and extract the correct git push command from the `stderr` output.

The corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
