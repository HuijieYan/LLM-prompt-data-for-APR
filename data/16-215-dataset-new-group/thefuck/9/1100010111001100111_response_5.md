The buggy function is failing to handle the cases where the command includes the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. It is also failing to correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

The root cause of the bug lies in the logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. This logic is not handling the cases properly and is also not correctly extracting the `push_upstream` value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to properly handle the removal of options and correctly extract the `push_upstream` value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(index)
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument as well
    if '-u' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(index)
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, it should properly handle the cases where the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options are included in the command, and correctly extract the `push_upstream` value. This should address the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
