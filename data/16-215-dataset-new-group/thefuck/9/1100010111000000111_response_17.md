The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly handling the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the git push command. It is trying to remove the option and its argument, but the logic is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, which results in incorrect suggestions being made for the git push command.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the git push command and then construct the new command accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return command.script.replace('push', f'push {push_upstream}')
```

In the corrected version, we don't need to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument. Instead, we extract the required part from the stderr and construct the new command by adding the push_upstream argument to the 'push' command.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
