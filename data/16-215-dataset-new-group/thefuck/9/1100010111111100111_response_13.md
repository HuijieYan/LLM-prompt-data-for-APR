The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing the failing test to throw an `IndexError: pop index out of range`. The buggy function is supposed to handle cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` are passed as arguments to the `git push` command, but it is not doing so correctly. It also fails to handle cases where other arguments are passed along with `--set-upstream` or `-u`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and their corresponding values from the command, and then properly constructs the new command using the `push_upstream` value.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved. The function now correctly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and their corresponding arguments, and constructs the new command using the `push_upstream` value.
