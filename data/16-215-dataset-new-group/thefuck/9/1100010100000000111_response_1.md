The buggy function has multiple issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the `upstream_option_index` variable is being set to `-1` initially, which is incorrect as it should be set to a value not present in the index of the `command.script_parts`. Secondly, the `upstream_option_index` is being incorrectly used to pop elements from `command.script_parts`, which can lead to index out of range errors. Lastly, the function is not properly handling the case when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not present in the command.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `upstream_option_index` is valid before popping elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we should handle the case when no upstream option is present. We can do this by properly setting the `upstream_option_index` based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u from the command
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) 

    # Get the suggested push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With these changes, the bug related to incorrectly suggesting the `git push` command when using `git push -u origin` should be resolved. We have properly checked for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command, handled the case when it is not present, and addressed the popping of elements from `command.script_parts` to avoid index out of range errors.
