The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This leads to an IndexError when trying to pop an element from the list that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we only pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list if they exist and are not out of range.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument only occurs if the index exists and is within the bounds of the list.
