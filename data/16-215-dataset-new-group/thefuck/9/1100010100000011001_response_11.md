The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and it is also not correctly extracting the `git push` command suggested by git from the command stderr.

The reason for the bug is that the code incorrectly tries to pop the `upstream_option_index` twice from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the code does not correctly extract the `git push` command from the `command.stderr`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, and correctly extract the `git push` command from the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extract the git push command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we properly handle removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. We also correctly extract the `git push` command from the `command.stderr` and return the modified command.
