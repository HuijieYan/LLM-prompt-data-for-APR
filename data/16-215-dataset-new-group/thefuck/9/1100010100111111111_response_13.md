The buggy function has an issue with how it handles the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list. The bug causes an IndexError when trying to pop the elements of the script_parts list that do not exist. This is because the buggy function mistakenly removes the elements twice.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is found, it is removed only once from the script_parts list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Only remove the index once
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list correctly, and it should pass the failing test case provided.

Additionally, this fix aligns with the GitHub issue #538, which reports a similar problem.
