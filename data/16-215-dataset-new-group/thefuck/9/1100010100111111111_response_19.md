The cause of the bug is that when the '-u' option is passed, the index of the script_parts list is not being correctly updated after removing the option and its argument. As a result, it is trying to remove an index that is out of range, causing the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to update the index of the script_parts list after removing the '-u' option and its argument. Additionally, we should handle the case where the '--set-upstream' option is present in the script_parts list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should handle the cases where the '-u' option is present and handle the '--set-upstream' option as well. This should resolve the IndexError issue and ensure that the function provides the correct output for the failing tests.
