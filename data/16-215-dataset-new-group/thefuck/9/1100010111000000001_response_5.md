The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The try-except block to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command.script_parts list might not be functioning correctly.
2. The pop operation on the command.script_parts list might not be removing the correct elements.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command.script_parts list, leading to incorrect results when creating the new command.

To fix the bug, we can use a more structured approach to identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command.script_parts list. Additionally, we need to correctly extract the push destination from the stderr and construct the new command using the extracted push destination.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # remove --set-upstream or -u from script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # extract push destination from stderr
    push_destination = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # construct the new command
    new_command = ['git'] + command.script_parts + [push_destination]

    return " ".join(new_command)
```

With this correction, the get_new_command function should now pass the failing test function.
