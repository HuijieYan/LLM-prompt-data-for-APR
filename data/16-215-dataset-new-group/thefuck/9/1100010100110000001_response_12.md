The error message indicates that the `IndexError: pop index out of range` is being raised in the `get_new_command` function on line 27. This suggests that there is an issue with removing the `'--set-upstream'` or `'-u'` flags from the `command.script_parts`, which is causing an error when attempting to pop the item at the specified index.

The buggy function is not properly handling the case in which the `'-u'` flag is being passed. It only considers the index of `'-u'` if `--set-upstream` is not found, but it should be conditional on the same condition that is applied for `--set-upstream`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags and their arguments from the `script_parts` before modifying the new command. Additionally, it's redundant to have the try-except block if there are two flags handled separately. One try-except block is sufficient for both cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags properly and pass the failing test.
