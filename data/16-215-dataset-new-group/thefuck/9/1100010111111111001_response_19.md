The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list without taking into account the possibility that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options might not be present.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in `command.script_parts` before trying to remove them. We also need to modify the logic for extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove --set-upstream
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument
    else:
        upstream_option = '-u'
        if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove -u
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    last_line = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')[-1]
    push_upstream = f"origin {last_line.split()[-1]}"

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output.
