The issue causing the buggy function to fail is that in the try-except block surrounding the `command.script_parts.index('-u')` call, the subsequent `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` call is executed regardless of whether the index was found.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` call is only executed if the index was found for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`. Additionally, we need to adjust the index we're popping to account for the fact that we are removing elements from the list, which will change the index of subsequent elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    else:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Need to pop again to remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the cases where the `-u` flag is present and correctly remove the flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
