The buggy function is 'get_new_command', which is meant to handle suggestions for the 'git push -u' command. The issue reported on GitHub (Issue #538) indicates that the suggestions for 'git push -u myfork' are not being handled correctly. The reported output shows that the suggestion should be 'git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp', but the actual suggestion is 'hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier'.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for handling the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag. The function is incorrectly removing the flag and its argument from the command, which leads to incorrect suggestions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for removing the flag and its argument and ensure that the correct push command is generated as a suggestion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    suggestion = command.script_parts.copy()  # Create a copy of the command parts

    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = suggestion.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = suggestion.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the flag and its argument
        suggestion.pop(upstream_option_index)
        suggestion.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Insert the correct push command at the beginning
    suggestion.insert(1, 'push')
    suggestion.insert(2, push_upstream)

    return " ".join(suggestion)
```

In the corrected version, we create a copy of the command parts to work with. Then, we properly handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag by removing it and its argument if present. After that, we insert the correct push command at the beginning of the suggestion and return the updated command as the suggestion. This should resolve the issue with incorrect suggestions for 'git push -u' as reported on GitHub.
