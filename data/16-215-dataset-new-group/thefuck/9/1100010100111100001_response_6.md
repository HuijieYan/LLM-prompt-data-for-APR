Based on the error message provided and the runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the bug is occurring due to the `upstream_option_index` being handled incorrectly. 

The function currently attempts to remove the `upstream_option_index` twice but instead should only be removing it once.

To fix this bug, we should update the part of the code that is removing the `upstream_option_index`. We should also use the correct index to obtain the `push_upstream` value and then use it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Adjust the index when removing a second in the case of '-u'
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
