The buggy function `get_new_command` is causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove items from the `command.script_parts` list. This occurs because the function tries to pop an element from the list at the index specified by `upstream_option_index`. However, even if `-u` is found, it sets `upstream_option_index` to the index of `-u` and then immediately overwrites it with the index of `--set-upstream`.

To fix this bug, the function should separate the two try-except blocks and use different variables for each option's index. Additionally, the pop operations should only be performed if the index is valid.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    set_upstream_index = -1
    try:
        set_upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    up_index = -1
    try:
        up_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if set_upstream_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(set_upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(set_upstream_index)
    elif up_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(up_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
