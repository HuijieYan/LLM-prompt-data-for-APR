The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it does not handle the case where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag is passed with an argument. This causes the command to be incorrectly modified.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to correctly handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we first attempt to find the index of '--set-upstream' and handle the case when it's not found. Then, we check for the index of '-u' and remove both the flag and its argument if they are found. Finally, we use the corrected index to remove the flag and its argument from the command script_parts.

This fix will ensure that the function correctly handles the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its argument and provides the correct new command for the git push.
