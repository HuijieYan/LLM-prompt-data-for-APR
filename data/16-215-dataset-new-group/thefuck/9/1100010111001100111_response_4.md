The buggy function is failing to correctly handle the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option while generating the new git push command. The issue is related to the incorrect indexing and removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option from the command script parts. Additionally, the function is not correctly extracting the push_upstream value from the stderr.

The buggy function fails due to the following reasons:
1. The upstream_option_index is not correctly identified or removed from the command.script_parts.
2. The push_upstream value is incorrectly extracted from command.stderr.


To fix the bug, we can modify the get_new_command function to correctly handle the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and accurately extract the push_upstream value from the stderr.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we properly remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option from the command script parts. Additionally, we extract the push_upstream value by splitting the stderr and retrieving the correct value from the last line.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issues posted on GitHub.
