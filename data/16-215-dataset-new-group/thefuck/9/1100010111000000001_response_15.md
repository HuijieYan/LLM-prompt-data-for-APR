```

Explanation:
The original buggy function did not correctly handle the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. It also did not correctly identify the index of the option to be removed. Additionally, the `try` block for finding the index of `-u` would always execute, even if `--set-upstream` was already found.

The corrected version of the function fixes this by using `if` statements to check for the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the command script parts and properly removing them if found.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
