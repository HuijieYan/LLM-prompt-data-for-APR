The bug appears to be in the handling and removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments from the `command.script_parts`. The function should remove these arguments and their respective values, and then subsequently construct a new `git push` command with the branch from the error message at the end.

The cause of the bug is that the code assigns the `upstream_option_index` twice, using separate `try` blocks for the two different arguments. This causes the second `else` block to be ignored, meaning that the `-u` option is never removed from the list of script parts.

To fix the bug, we should remove the separate `try` blocks and replace them with a single `try` block that checks for both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options. Then, we should fix the logic so that the correct `git push` command can be constructed using the provided branch from the error message.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the -u or --set-upstream flag
        upstream_argument = command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument following the flag
        push_upstream = upstream_argument if upstream_argument != 'origin' else 'origin master'  # parse the upstream argument
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'  # default branch used when no upstream is specified

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases provided.
