## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
In the corrected version, the bug was fixed by replacing the try-except blocks with if-elif statements to properly handle the removal of 'push -u' and 'push --set-upstream' options from the command. This ensures that the specified upstream options are removed correctly from the command.script_parts list. Also, we fixed the condition for checking the value of upstream_option_index and added proper comparison operators.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
