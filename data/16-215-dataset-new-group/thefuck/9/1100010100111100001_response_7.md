From the error message and the failing tests, we can see that the bug in the function occurs at the statement `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`, which raises an `IndexError` when the `upstream_option_index` is `-1` because it tries to remove the element at index `-1`. This issue arises when the 'git push -u' command is passed to the function, as in the second failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to use a conditional check that ensures the `pop` method is only called when `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by adding a conditional check to ensure that the `pop` method is only called when `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1`. Additionally, the code checks if the index of the `upstream_option_index` is still within the bounds of the list before removing the element using the `pop` method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
