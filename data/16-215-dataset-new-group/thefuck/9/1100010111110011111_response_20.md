The buggy function attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command and then constructs a new command with the suggested upstream option returned by the `git push` command.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument may not be implemented correctly, causing an IndexError when attempting to pop elements from the list `command.script_parts`.
2. The index used to extract the suggested upstream option from the `stderr` may not be accurate.

The cause of the bug is that the code doesn't handle cases where the optional `-u` flag is absent, and the parsing of the suggested upstream option may not be accurate, resulting in an incorrect list index and IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the index for `--set-upstream` or `-u` is valid before attempting to remove elements from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we need to accurately extract the suggested upstream option from the `stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the corresponding argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected function, it will handle cases where the `-u` flag may not be present, accurately remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and correctly extract the suggested upstream option from the `stderr`. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing tests while satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
