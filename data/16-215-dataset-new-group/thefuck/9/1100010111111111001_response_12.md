Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the cause of the bug is the misuse of the `pop` method. The buggy function is removing both `--set-upstream` and its argument in the wrong way when it exists in the `command.script_parts`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. We can achieve this by identifying the correct index for these elements and then removing them appropriately. Additionally, we should set the `push_upstream` variable to the correct value by extracting it from the `command.stderr` using the appropriate method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].replace('    ', '').strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output for all provided cases.
