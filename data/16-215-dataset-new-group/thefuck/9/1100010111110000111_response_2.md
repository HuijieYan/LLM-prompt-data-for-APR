To fix the bug, we need to address the IndexError when trying to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command script. The failing test, corresponding error message, and GitHub issue indicate that the bug occurs when trying to remove the element at the index indicated by `upstream_option_index`. This index can throw an IndexError if it is not found in the command script.

We can fix this bug by first checking if the index `upstream_option_index` is valid before attempting to remove the elements from the command script.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts`. This ensures that we do not encounter an IndexError when trying to remove elements. This fix should address the failing test case, resolve the issue posted in GitHub, and prevent the IndexError.
