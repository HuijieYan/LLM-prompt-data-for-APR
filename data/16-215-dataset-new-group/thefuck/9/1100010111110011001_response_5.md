The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by an incorrect use of the `pop` method on the `command.script_parts` list. When an index is removed from the list, the length of the list is reduced, causing the subsequent pop operation to throw an `IndexError` since it is out of the range. This error is apparent from the error message provided.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index to be removed exists within the list before performing the pop operation. Also, the logic for updating the command needs to be based on whether the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Now, the function should handle the presence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` options properly and avoid the index error when updating the command.

With this corrected version, the failing test cases should pass and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
