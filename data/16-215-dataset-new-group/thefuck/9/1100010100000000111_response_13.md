Based on the provided GitHub issue and the buggy function, it seems that the bug is related to the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from the command. The bug causes the incorrect suggestion to be generated when the `git push -u` command is used.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to properly handle the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument, as well as extracting the correct push upstream from the `stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2]  # Updated to use the correct index
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument properly, and also extract the correct push upstream from the `stderr` of the command.

This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u` commands.
