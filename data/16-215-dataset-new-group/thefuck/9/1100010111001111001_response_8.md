The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing the failing tests to produce incorrect output. The function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` option and its argument if it is present in the `git push` command. Then, it extracts the correct push command from the stderr and returns it with the `--set-upstream` option added.

The bug occurs because the function erroneously attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` option and its argument with indexes that are not properly identified. Additionally, the `push_upstream` variable does not accurately extract the correct push command.

To fix this bug, the function should use a more robust method to identify and remove the `--set-upstream` option and its argument, and correctly extract the push command using the information provided in the stderr.

The following is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    
    for i, part in enumerate(script_parts):
        if part in ['-u', '--set-upstream']:
            script_parts = script_parts[:i] + script_parts[i+2:]
            break
    
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].split('use')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream.strip())
```

The corrected version of the function correctly removes the `--set-upstream` option and its argument from the command, and extracts the push command from stderr, resulting in an accurate new command.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
