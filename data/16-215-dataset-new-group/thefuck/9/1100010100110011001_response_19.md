The bug in the given function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the '-u' option is passed in the command. This leads to an IndexError when trying to remove the '-u' option from the command.script_parts list.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when the '-u' option is passed in the command and correctly update the `push_upstream` variable to consider both the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated version of the function correctly handles both cases when '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are passed in the command, updates the `push_upstream` variable accordingly, and removes the options from the command.script_parts list as needed.
