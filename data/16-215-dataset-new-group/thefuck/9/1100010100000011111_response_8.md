The bug in the given function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the "-u" or "--set-upstream" option is present in the git push command. The function incorrectly removes the option and its argument, which leads to an incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the index of the upstream_option_index when trying to remove the "-u" or "--set-upstream" option from the command.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is present in the command, and if so, remove it and its argument. Then, we should correctly extract the push_upstream value from the stderr and return the replace_argument with the corrected command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle the --set-upstream and -u options, and provide the expected output for the given test cases. This fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
