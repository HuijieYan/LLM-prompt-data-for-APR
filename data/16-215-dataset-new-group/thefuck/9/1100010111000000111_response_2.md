The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the parsing of the push command from the stderr is not accurate.

To fix this bug, we need to:
1. Update the function to properly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.
2. Correctly parse the push command from the `stderr` to ensure we're extracting the correct value.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in parts:
        index = parts.index('--set-upstream')
        parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
        parts.pop(index)  # Remove its argument
    if '-u' in parts:
        index = parts.index('-u')
        parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
        parts.pop(index)  # Remove its argument

    push_command = ''
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.strip().startswith('git push'):
            push_command = line.strip().split('git push')[-1]
            break

    return f"git push {push_command.strip()}"
```

This updated function ensures that the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument are correctly removed from the command, and it accurately extracts the push command from the `stderr`.

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
