The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the way the `upstream_option_index` is being handled. The `upstream_option_index` is being set to -1 at the start, but it's not being updated within the try-except blocks, leading to the final condition checking for its value to be incorrect. Additionally, the pop operation is causing an IndexError because the same index is being removed twice.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly update the `upstream_option_index` within the try-except blocks and check for its value to determine if the pop operations should be executed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop again to remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the `upstream_option_index` correctly and perform the pop operations only if the index is not -1.

This should resolve the IndexError and ensure that the function returns the expected values for the failing test case.
