The buggy function has a few issues:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is not being correctly set for the `-u` option.
2. The `pop` method is being used to remove elements from `command.script_parts` without checking if the elements exist.

The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is not being correctly set for the `-u` option, and the `pop` method is being used without checking if the elements exist. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove elements that are not present in `command.script_parts`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly set the `upstream_option_index` for the `-u` option, and check if the elements exist before using the `pop` method. Additionally, we need to take into account the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not present in the `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and (upstream_option_index + 1) < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in `command.script_parts` and produce the expected output for all test cases.
