The issue with the provided function is that it only removes the --set-upstream or -u arguments from the command parts, but it does not remove the argument that comes after -u. Furthermore, it tries to extract push_upstream information from command.stderr without handling the case when command.stderr is empty.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the get_new_command function to remove the -u argument and any arguments that come after it, and handle the edge case where command.stderr is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    if '-u' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts = command_parts[:index]

    elif '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts = command_parts[:index]

    push_upstream = "origin master"  # Default value in case of empty command.stderr
    if command.stderr:
        command_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
        if len(command_lines) >= 3 and 'git' in command_lines[-3]:  # Check if push_upstream could be found
            push_upstream = command_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

I have created a new internal list called `command_parts` to avoid modifying the original list `command.script_parts`. Then we check for the presence of -u or --set-upstream in the command parts and accordingly remove them and anything that comes after them from the `command_parts`. For the `push_upstream` extraction, we added a condition to check if command.stderr is not empty before trying to extract the push_upstream information. If command.stderr is empty or the push_upstream information is not found, a default value of "origin master" is used.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests provided.
