Upon analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the logic of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The buggy function is not properly handling the removal of the option and its argument, resulting in incorrect output.

The bug is causing the failing test cases to produce incorrect output, as the `get_new_command` function is not effectively removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the input command.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and properly handle the concatenation of remaining arguments onto the command suggested by git. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct `push_upstream` value is used to replace the argument in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    new_command_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ('--set-upstream', '-u')]
    new_command_parts.append(push_upstream)
    
    return " ".join(new_command_parts)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test cases should produce the expected output, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
