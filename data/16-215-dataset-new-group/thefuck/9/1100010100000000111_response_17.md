## The analysis and fix

### Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script before returning a new command. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `git push -u` command is not being suggested correctly, and it should be `git push --set-upstream`.

### Potential error locations:
1. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument may not be working correctly.
2. The extraction of the command from `command.stderr` may not be accurate.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. This leads to the incorrect suggestion when the `git push -u` command is executed.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The buggy function needs to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script. Additionally, the extraction of the command from `command.stderr` needs to be accurate to generate the correct new command.

### The corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)      # Remove option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function above addresses the issue with the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. Additionally, the extraction of the command from `command.stderr` has been adjusted to ensure that the correct command is obtained. This should resolve the GitHub issue related to the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u`.
