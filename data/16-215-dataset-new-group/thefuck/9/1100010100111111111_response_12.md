The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the upstream option index and the subsequent removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list. This results in an IndexError when trying to pop elements from an empty list, as seen in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases when the upstream option index is found and remove the correct elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Get the index of either '--set-upstream' or '-u'
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument from the script parts
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the upstream option index correctly and remove the corresponding elements from the `command.script_parts` list without causing an IndexError. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
