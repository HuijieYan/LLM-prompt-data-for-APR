The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the `git push` command, and replace it with the appropriate push upstream command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an argument from `command.script_parts` due to pop index being out of range.

The cause of the bug is that the upstream option index is not checked for `--set-upstream` before trying to remove it using `pop`. Also, the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is not adequate to ensure that an upstream option has been found, as it should only be triggered if the index is found. 

To fix the bug, a strategy is to check for both conditions where the upstream options are supposedly found, and only if one of them is found, then proceed with removing it from `command.script_parts`.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should no longer throw an `IndexError` and pass the failing test.
