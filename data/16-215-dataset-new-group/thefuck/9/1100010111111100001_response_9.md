The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is intended to update the `git push` command following specific rules. However, the function currently has an issue with handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag.

When analyzing the failing test and the error message, it is clear that the buggy function is failing when it attempts to remove the option and its argument using the `pop` method. The error message states an "IndexError: pop index out of range", indicating that it's trying to remove an element from an empty list or an invalid index.

The cause of the bug is related to how the function removes both the option and its argument when encountered. In some scenarios, removing the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u` also shifts the index of the other option, causing it to be out of range by the time the function attempts to remove it.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to check and remove both the option and its argument individually without relying on their index alone. This can be achieved by implementing conditional checks to remove the options and their arguments if found within the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying the fix above, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
