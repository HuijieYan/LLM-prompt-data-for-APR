The buggy function is failing to correctly handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `git push` command, resulting in incorrect new command suggestions.

The potential error in the buggy function is the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable assignment and the subsequent removal of corresponding elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly assumes that `--set-upstream` or `-u` will always be at index 1 in the `command.script_parts` list, leading to the incorrect removal of elements from the list and resulting in an inaccurate new command suggestion.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list and handle its removal properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the script parts
    for idx, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            upstream_option_index = idx
            break
            
    # If the option is found, remove it and its argument
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, ensuring an accurate new command suggestion.
