The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command. The function is incorrectly removing them, and it's not extracting the correct `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` input.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command, and extract the correct `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now properly handle the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command. It also extracts the correct `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` input.
