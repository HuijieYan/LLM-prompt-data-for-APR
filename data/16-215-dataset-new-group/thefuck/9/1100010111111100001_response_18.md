The issue in the buggy function is that it's trying to remove an index from the `command.script_parts` list based on the detection of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, without verifying if that index exists in the list or not. This leads to a situation where the index might not exist, causing an `IndexError`. 

To fix this bug, we need to validate the existence of the option index before attempting to remove it from the list. We can use the `remove_argument` utility function provided by the `thefuck.utils` module to safely remove the option and its argument.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        command = replace_argument(command, option, '')
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the edge case of the option index not existing in the list, resolving the `IndexError` issue and passing the failing test cases.
