The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, in the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present, the function incorrectly assumes that the last three lines of `command.stderr` contain the suggestion for the new command, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, we need to properly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from `command.script_parts` and then extract the suggestion for the new command from `command.stderr` using the correct logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract suggestion for the new command from command.stderr
    push_suggestion = command.stderr.split('use\n')[1].strip()

    return f"git {push_suggestion}"
```

This corrected version handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments correctly and then extracts the suggestion for the new command from `command.stderr` based on the specific formatting of the error message. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
