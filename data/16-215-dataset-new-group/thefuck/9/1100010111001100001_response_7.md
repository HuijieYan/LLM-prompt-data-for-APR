The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` and `-u` arguments from the `command.script_parts` list, but it doesn't handle the position of these arguments correctly, and it doesn't account for the `-u` argument with an additional argument, like `-u origin`.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Handle the case for the `-u` argument along with an additional argument.
2. Determine the correct position of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument before attempting to remove it from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
            if len(command_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:  # Check for additional argument
                upstream_option_index += 1
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command_parts[upstream_option_index]  # Remove the --set-upstream or -u argument
        if len(command_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if there are additional arguments to remove
            del command_parts[upstream_option_index]

    stdout_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    push_upstream = stdout_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we extract the list of `command_parts` at the beginning, then based on the existence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, and its position, we remove the argument and its additional parameter if it's present.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the `get_new_command` function work as expected, passing the failing test cases mentioned.
