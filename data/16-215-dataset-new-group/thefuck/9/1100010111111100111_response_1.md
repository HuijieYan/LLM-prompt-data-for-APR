To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The function is not correctly identifying the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the elements at those indexes.
2. The `push_upstream` variable is not being set correctly, resulting in incorrect output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split()[-2:]
    return "git push --set-upstream " + " ".join(push_upstream)
```

The changes made to the function are as follows:
1. The `try-except` block is used to first try finding the index of `--set-upstream` and then `-u`. If neither is found, we set `upstream_option_index` to -1.
2. The logic for setting the `push_upstream` variable is replaced with splitting the `command.stderr` correctly to get the desired output.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.
