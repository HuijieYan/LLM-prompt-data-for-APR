## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to fix suggestions for the `git push` command with the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option, but there are some potential error locations within the function. One potential error is that the index removal for the `-u` option is incorrect. Additionally, the extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr might not be handling the input correctly.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `-u` option index removal and the incorrect extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly remove the index of the `-u` option from `command.script_parts` without removing the associated argument.
2. Improve the extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr to ensure it captures the correct result.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option but preserve the argument
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index + 1].startswith('-'):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        else:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the push upstream command from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
