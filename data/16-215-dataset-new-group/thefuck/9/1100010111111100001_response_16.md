The bug in the function "get_new_command" is that the handler for option '-u' to remove it and its argument from the command script is not working correctly. This is causing the 'pop' method on the list to go out of range for some test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the code block intended to remove the '-u' option is not handling the index to be correctly removed from the `command.script_parts` list. The logic to remove the element at the found 'upstream_option_index' is incorrect, resulting in an "IndexError: pop index out of range" for the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the code should iterate through the script parts and handle the removal of the '-u' option and its argument correctly. Additionally, a check for valid index should be implemented to avoid 'pop' method errors.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    to_remove = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    new_parts = []
    
    while len(command_parts) > 0:
        part = command_parts.pop(0)
        if part in to_remove:
            if len(command_parts) > 0:
                command_parts.pop(0)  # remove the argument of the option
        else:
            new_parts.append(part)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
After updating this function, re-run the failing test cases to ensure they pass without any errors.
