The bug in the function is related to how it handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The function also incorrectly retrieves the `push_upstream` value by splitting the `command.stderr` output.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly removes the `-u` flag and its argument. The `pop` method is used twice, leading to an incorrect removal of elements from the list. Additionally, the function incorrectly retrieves the `push_upstream` value by splitting the `command.stderr` output.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the removal of the `-u` flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The `split` method of `command.stderr` should be used to properly retrieve the `push_upstream` value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('    ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `index` method to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list. If the flag is found, we remove it and its argument. Additionally, we correctly use the `split` and `partition` methods to retrieve the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` output, ensuring we get the correct value.
