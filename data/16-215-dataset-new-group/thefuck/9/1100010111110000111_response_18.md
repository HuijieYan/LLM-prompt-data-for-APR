The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it tries to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, but it does so incorrectly which leads to an IndexError when trying to pop the index out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument, and then remove them from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # check if there's an argument after -u or --set-upstream
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)   # remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version handles the case where there is no argument after `-u` or `--set-upstream` by using an if statement to check the length of `command.script_parts` before trying to remove the argument.

This fix should resolve the IndexError and the function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
