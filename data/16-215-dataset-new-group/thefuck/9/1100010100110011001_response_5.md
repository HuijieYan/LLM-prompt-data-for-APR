The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that the code tries to pop the `upstream_option_index` twice from the `command.script_parts` list, which causes the `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the index is only popped once if it exists in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Ensure the index is still valid after the previous pop
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `command.script_parts` list is not accessed outside of its boundaries, preventing the `IndexError` that was occurring before.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
