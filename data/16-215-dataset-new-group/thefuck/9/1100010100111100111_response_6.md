The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `-u` option in the `git push` command. The function attempts to remove the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, but does not handle the argument properly, causing the index out of range error.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the `-u` option is present, and if so, directly replace it with the suggested command obtained from `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), '-u', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None  # No need to fix the command, return None
```

With this correction, the function checks if the `-u` option is present and directly replaces it with the suggested command obtained from `command.stderr`. This should resolve the index out of range error and handle the `-u` option correctly.

By implementing this change, the function will handle the `-u` option properly and provide the correct command as output.

This fix should also address the reported GitHub issue related to incorrect suggestions for `git push -u` commands.
