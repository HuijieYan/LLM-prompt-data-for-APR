By reviewing the provided code, I have identified some potential issues with the `get_new_command` function. The main issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the command doesn't contain `--set-upstream` or `-u`, causing the Index error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, I modified the `get_new_command` function to handle the case where either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not present in the command. I added an additional condition to check for the presence of `-u`, and if it is present, it removes it along with its argument `origin`. Then the `push_upstream` variable is set and used to replace the argument in the command.

These changes address the error in the failing test and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
