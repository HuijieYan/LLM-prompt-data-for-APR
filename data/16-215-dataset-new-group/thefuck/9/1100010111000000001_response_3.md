The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The use of `command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')` and `command.script_parts.index('-u')` may not handle the case where the arguments are not present in the command.
2. The pop method is not used correctly to remove the '--set-upstream' and its argument from the command.script_parts list.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the cases where '--set-upstream' or '-u' are not present in the command.

To fix the bug, we can use the `remove_argument` function to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command. Then, we can concatenate 'push' with the upstream branch obtained from stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import remove_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    remove_argument(command, '--set-upstream')
    remove_argument(command, '-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return "git push {}".format(push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
