The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is supposed to handle the case when the `git push` command is used with the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. The function is causing an IndexError when the command includes the `-u` option. This is evident from the failing test, where the input `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)` causes an IndexError at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to pop an item from `command.script_parts` using the `upstream_option_index` as the index, but it is not taking into account the fact that the list is being modified in previous steps. This causes the index to become out of range, leading to the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the case when the `-u` option is present, and ensure that the index used for popping items from `command.script_parts` is adjusted based on the modifications done to the list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `--set-upstream` option is present in the command, and if so, we remove it from `command.script_parts`. Then, we check for the `-u` option and remove it at the correct index. This approach ensures that we handle each option separately and adjust the list as needed before generating the new command.
