The buggy function `get_new_command` has the following issues:
1. It uses the wrong index to access the `stderr` output for parsing the push upstream branch.
2. It doesn't handle the case where there is no '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command.

The failing test `test_get_new_command` demonstrates that the `get_new_command` function is not producing the correct output for various input commands and stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly parse the `stderr` to extract the push upstream branch.
2. Add logic to handle the case where '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not present in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the push upstream branch from the stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(stderr_lines):
        if line.strip().startswith('git push '):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git push ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    # If push upstream branch is not found in stderr, use default 'origin master'
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', 'origin master')
```

With this correction, the `get_new_command` function should now produce the correct output based on the command and stderr input and pass the failing test cases.
