The bug in the provided function is caused by the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' argument from the `git push` command. The function currently checks for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags, and if found, it attempts to remove them and their corresponding arguments from `command.script_parts`. However, the index of the second occurrence of the flag is used in the removal process for both cases, causing incorrect removal of arguments.

To fix the bug, the correct index of each flag should be used when removing them.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After the first removal, the index of the argument also changes
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            return " ".join(command.script_parts)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After the first removal, the index of the argument also changes
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing tests provided.
