The buggy function has several potential error locations that could cause the failing test.
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is being assigned the value of the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, which could cause unexpected behavior if both options are present in the command.
2. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is incorrect, as `is not` should be replaced with `!=` or `!==` to properly check for the value of `upstream_option_index`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command, and it is not correctly extracting the value for `push_upstream` from the stderr.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Update the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command.
2. Parse the correct value for `push_upstream` from the stderr, in this case `'origin master'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]  # extract the correct value for push_upstream
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
