The bug in the function `get_new_command` occurs when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is passed. The function incorrectly removes the option and its argument from the command, and then extracts the suggested git push command from the `stderr`. However, it does not correctly handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is already included in the command. This causes the function to provide incorrect push suggestions.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is already included in the command, and it needs to properly extract the suggested git push command from the `stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the suggested git push command from the stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return None
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is already included in the command, and it properly extracts the suggested git push command from the `stderr`. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to push suggestions for `git push -u origin`.
