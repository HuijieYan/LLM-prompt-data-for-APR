### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to handle the git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then replacing the `push` argument with the correct upstream. However, there are a few potential error locations within this function:
1. The use of `try-except` blocks to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` may not work as intended.
2. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command may be flawed.
3. The extraction of the upstream from the stderr may not be accurate.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy behavior in the function `get_new_command` is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, as well as the extraction of the upstream from the stderr.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct method to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, and properly remove them from the command.
2. Ensure that the extraction of the upstream from the stderr is accurate and reliable.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the upstream from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
