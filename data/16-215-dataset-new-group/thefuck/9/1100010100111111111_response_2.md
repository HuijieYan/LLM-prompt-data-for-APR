The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError: pop index out of range` which is happening when `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called. This error is occurring because the `upstream_option_index` is being set to the wrong value when the `-u` flag is used.

The buggy function logic is flawed in finding the index of `push_upstream` and handling the `-u` flag. It is also not considering the case when the `--set-upstream` flag is being used.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the index of the flags `-u` or `--set-upstream` and then modify the `command.script_parts` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > 0:  # Check if a valid index is found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]  # Remove the argument of the flag

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should correctly identify and remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` flag and its argument when present in the `command.script_parts`. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output for all the runtime cases provided.
