The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the `git push` command and replace it with the suggestion provided by Git. The issue is that the function is not correctly handling the removal of the `-u` argument and its value, and it also does not handle the case where the command already includes `--set-upstream`.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly identifies the index of the `-u` argument and does not remove it properly. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the command already includes `--set-upstream`.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the `--set-upstream` argument is already present in the command. If it is not present, then we should check for the `-u` argument and remove it along with its value. If the `--set-upstream` argument is present, we should skip the removal of `-u` and just proceed with the rest of the logic.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream is already present in the command
    if '--set-upstream' not in command.script_parts:
        # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return new_command
```

The corrected function checks if `--set-upstream` is already present in the command and handles the removal of the `-u` argument accordingly. It then proceeds with the rest of the logic to replace the argument with the suggested command from Git. This should fix the bug and align with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
