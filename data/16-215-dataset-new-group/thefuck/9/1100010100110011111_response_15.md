The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` due to the attempt to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list that does not exist. This is happening when the `-u` option is passed to the `git push` command.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `'-u'` option is present before trying to find its index in the `command.script_parts` list and remove it if it exists. Additionally, we need to extract the `push_upstream` value from the correct portion of the `stderr` message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case when `-u` option is present and will correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from `stderr`. This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
