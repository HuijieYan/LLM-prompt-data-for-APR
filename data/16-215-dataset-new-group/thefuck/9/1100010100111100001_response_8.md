The bug in the given function causes the "IndexError: pop index out of range" because on line 27 of the function, the pop method is called twice on the index `upstream_option_index`, which removes two elements at once. However, in the failing test's input values, the command only shows one '-u' argument, but the script_parts has two elements.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the script_parts to correctly handle scenarios with or without the existence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return

    # Remove the flag and its argument
    command.script_parts.pop(index)
    command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected implementation checks for the existence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags and removes them accordingly. Running the failing test cases with this corrected function should now pass the tests.
