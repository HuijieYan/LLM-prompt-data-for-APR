The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in the logic to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the command. The bug is causing the function to return an incorrect command, failing the test cases provided.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in parts:
        index = parts.index('--set-upstream')
        parts.pop(index)  # remove --set-upstream
        parts.pop(index)  # remove its argument
    if '-u' in parts:
        index = parts.index('-u')
        parts.pop(index)  # remove -u
        parts.pop(index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument correctly, and pass the failing test cases. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
