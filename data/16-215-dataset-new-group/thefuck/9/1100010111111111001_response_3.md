The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by the attempt to pop the same index from the `command.script_parts` list multiple times. This causes an IndexError when trying to pop the same index again if the first attempt was successful.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to only pop the index once, regardless of whether it was found under `--set-upstream` or `-u`.

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Also need to pop the argument of the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) 

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated version of the `get_new_command` function should handle the multiple pops correctly and resolve the bug. If you run the test cases now, the corrected function should pass each of the tests successfully.
