The bug in the given code is that it does not correctly remove the --set-upstream or -u argument and its subsequent argument from the command.script_parts. This leads to an incorrect push_upstream value, which is then used to create the new command with the replace_argument function.

The first bug is that the code simply checks for the presence of the --set-upstream or -u flag and removes it from the command.script_parts without taking into account the arguments that follow it. This results in the incorrect push_upstream value as seen in the runtime values in the different cases, which always includes the "origin" and "master" arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to properly remove the --set-upstream or -u flag along with their arguments from the command.script_parts. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected function, we check for the presence of the --set-upstream or -u flags, and if found, we remove both the flag and their argument from the command.script_parts. This should fix the bug and generate the correct push_upstream value to use in creating the new command.
