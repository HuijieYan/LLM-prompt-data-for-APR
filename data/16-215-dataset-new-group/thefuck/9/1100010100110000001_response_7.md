The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it is supposed to modify the git push command to include the upstream branch. The error message "IndexError: pop index out of range" indicates that there is an attempt to remove an element at an index that doesn't exist in the `command.script_parts` list.

The bug is occurring because the script is attempting to pop the elements at `upstream_option_index` and then again at the same index after that. This results in the `IndexError` when attempting to pop the element at `upstream_option_index` again.

To fix this bug, we should remove the element at `upstream_option_index` only once, and not attempt to remove it again.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
