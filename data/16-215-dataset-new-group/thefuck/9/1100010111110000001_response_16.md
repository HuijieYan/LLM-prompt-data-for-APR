The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises due to the pop method being used to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list. The errors are occurring because the index generated by the `upstream_option_index` variable is not used correctly. The first problematic line inside the `if` condition causes issues because it removes an element from the list, and the following line then attempts to remove the same index again. This results in an `IndexError` since the index is now out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for removing elements from the list based on the `upstream_option_index`. We should first remove the element at the specified index and then subtract 1 from the `upstream_option_index` variable to account for the element that was removed.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        upstream_option_index -= 1  # Decrement the index to account for the removed element
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrections made, the function should be able to handle the removal of elements from the list without causing `IndexError`. All the failing test cases should now pass.
