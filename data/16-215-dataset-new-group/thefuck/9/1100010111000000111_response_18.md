The bug in the "get_new_command" function is related to handling the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option in the git push command. The function is supposed to remove these options and their arguments from the command script parts and then fetch the suggested command from the stderr output. However, there are several issues in the function. 

1. The "upstream_option_index" variable is initialized with -1, which should be None. This causes the condition "if upstream_option_index is not -1" to be always true.
2. The pop operation to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and their arguments is incorrect because it removes elements at the same index twice, which can lead to an out-of-index error and incorrect removal of elements.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the function to correctly handle the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and their arguments, as well as obtain the suggested command from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and their arguments from the command script parts
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    while '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_index)
    while '-u' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    # Fetch the suggested command from the stderr output
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the removal of "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and their arguments, and obtain the suggested command from the stderr. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
