The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is used to manipulate the command used to push changes to a git repository. The function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and replace the `push` argument with the suggested remote and branch provided by git.

Based on the failing test and the provided runtime values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and it's not correctly extracting the suggested remote and branch from the `stderr` of the command.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not correctly locating and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested remote and branch from the `command.stderr` seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly locate and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, and then extract the suggested remote and branch from the `command.stderr` in a more robust manner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('use')[1].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and also extract the correct suggested remote and branch from the `command.stderr`. This should address the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
