The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the '-u' flag in the 'git push' command. It mistakenly removes the '-u' and its argument, causing an IndexError when trying to access that index in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the '-u' flag is present and then handle it separately from the '--set-upstream' flag. If the '-u' flag is present, we should simply replace it with '--set-upstream', as they serve the same purpose in the 'git push' command.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None  # Return early if neither flag is present

    command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] = '--set-upstream'  # Replace -u with --set-upstream

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags correctly and pass the failing test described in the GitHub issue.
