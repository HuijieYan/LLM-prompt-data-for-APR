The bug in the function is causing the `push_upstream` variable to include the `push` command twice and `--set-upstream` as an argument. This is not the expected behavior and is causing incorrect command suggestions.

The bug seems to be located in the logic for obtaining the `push_upstream` value, as it is incorrectly concatenating the string with the `push` command twice and the upstream branch argument.

To fix the bug, the logic for obtaining the `push_upstream` value needs to be revised. The `push_upstream` should only include the remote and the branch, without the `push` command or the `--set-upstream` argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    push_upstream = push_upstream.replace('git push --set-upstream ', '')
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, the `push_upstream` value is obtained by removing the 'git push --set-upstream ' part of the string, leaving only the remote and the branch. This will ensure that the correct command is suggested without duplicated or unnecessary parts.
