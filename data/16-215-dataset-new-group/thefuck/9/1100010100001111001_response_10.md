The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly removing the --set-upstream or -u and its argument from the command. Additionally, it is not correctly extracting the suggested git command from the error message.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly remove the --set-upstream or -u and its argument from the command and extract the suggested git command from the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument from the command
    new_script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ('--set-upstream', '-u')]

    # Extract the suggested git command from the error message
    error_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    if len(error_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = error_lines[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip()
    else:
        push_upstream = ''

    # Replace 'push' with the suggested command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
