The bug in the function comes from the incorrect removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, causing an IndexError when trying to pop them from the list of command parts.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command parts list. We also need to correctly extract the command suggested by git from the stderr and replace the 'push' argument with it in the command parts list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    new_command_parts[new_command_parts.index('push')] = push_upstream  # Replace 'push' with the suggested command
    return " ".join(new_command_parts)
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument, and replace the 'push' argument with the suggested command from git. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
