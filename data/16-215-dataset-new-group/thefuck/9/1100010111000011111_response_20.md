The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options from the command and not extracting the correct push_upstream value from the command's stderr. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly checking if the --set-upstream or -u options are present in the command and not removing them correctly. Additionally, it is not correctly extracting the push_upstream value from the command's stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check for the presence of --set-upstream or -u options in the command and remove them if present. We also need to extract the correct push_upstream value from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u options properly and extract the correct push_upstream value from the command's stderr. This will ensure that the function passes the failing test cases and resolves the GitHub issue.
