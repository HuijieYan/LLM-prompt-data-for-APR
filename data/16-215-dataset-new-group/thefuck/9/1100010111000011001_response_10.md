The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then replace the `push` argument with the command suggested by git. However, there are a few issues in the current implementation:

1. The logic to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` is incorrect. Both `try` blocks are independent, and even if the first one succeeds, the second one will still execute. This leads to the latter value overwriting the former value.
2. The pop operation on `command.script_parts` is incorrect as it is popping the same index twice, and the intended index may not be removed properly.
3. The logic to extract `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr` is not properly handling edge cases and potential variations in the error message.

To fix the issues and pass the failing test, the buggy function can be corrected as follows:

```python
# Fixed and corrected version of the buggy function
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if len(command.script_parts) > index + 1:
                command.script_parts.pop(index + 1)
            command.script_parts.remove(option)

    # Extract push_upstream from the command.stderr
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(error_lines):
        if line.strip().startswith('hint: '):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    # If push_upstream is not found in error message, fall back to default
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', '--set-upstream origin master')
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected values and types of variables.
