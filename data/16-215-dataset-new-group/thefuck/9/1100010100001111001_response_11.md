The bug in the function `get_new_command` is that it always tries to remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u` from the command, regardless of whether one of them exists. Additionally, the function incorrectly calculates the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

To fix the bug, we should change the logic to only remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` if they exist, and fix the `push_upstream` extraction from the command's stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u if present in the command
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract push_upstream from the stderr
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.strip().startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return command.script  # Return the original command if push_upstream couldn't be extracted
```

This corrected version maintains the original behavior while addressing the bug by correctly removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` only if they exist, and properly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.
