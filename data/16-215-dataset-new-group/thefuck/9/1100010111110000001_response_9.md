Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with test code, corresponding error message:
- The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it is being used in the failing tests to check for expected behavior.
- The failing test is raising an IndexError indicating that `command.script_parts.pop` is using an index that is out of range.

Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The line causing the error is `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. It is trying to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list using the index `upstream_option_index`, which is causing the `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, the corresponding error message:
- The buggy function is failing to properly handle the removal of elements from the list `command.script_parts`. This is resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to `pop` an element using an index that does not exist due to the incorrect removal logic.

Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
- The strategy for fixing the bug would involve properly finding and removing the elements by value, rather than by index, to prevent `IndexError`.
- Additionally, it's important to handle the cases where the targeted elements are not found in the list, in order to avoid exceptions.

Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should pass the failing test:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
By using the `remove` method instead of `pop`, the corrected function ensures that the specified elements are removed from the list `command.script_parts`. Additionally, potential `ValueError` exceptions are handled using `try-except` blocks to avoid raising exceptions when trying to remove non-existing elements.
