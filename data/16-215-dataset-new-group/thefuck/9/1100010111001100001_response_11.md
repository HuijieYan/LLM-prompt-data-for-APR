In the provided buggy function, the error is occurring in the logic for locating the upstream option index (upstream_option_index). Additionally, removing the upstream option and its argument is not being done accurately. The cause of the bug is that the code does not appropriately handle the presence of '-u' or '--set-upstream' options.

A potential strategy for correcting the bug is to properly handle the scenarios for finding the index of '-u' or '--set-upstream' and accurately removing the upstream option and its argument from the command. Furthermore, the push_upstream value should be set appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The correct version of the function should now pass the failing test.

The corrected version handles the scenario for locating the index of '-u' or '--set-upstream' as well as removing the upstream option and its argument accurately. This ensures that the push_upstream value is set appropriately.

Testing and validating the corrected version of the function with the provided failing test cases will confirm that the bug has been fixed.
