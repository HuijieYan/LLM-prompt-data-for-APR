The buggy function has a problem with handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments, which is causing the IndexError in the failing test. The `upstream_option_index` is not being reset to -1 after the first try block, which means that if the first try block fails to find `--set-upstream`, the value set by the second try block will overwrite it.

Additionally, the `push_upstream` extraction is not handling the possibility of the command having different output formats, which leads to incorrect extraction and replacement with the `replace_argument` function.

To fix the bug, the `upstream_option_index` needs to be set to -1 in both try blocks and combined into one if statement to properly handle both arguments. Furthermore, the extraction of `push_upstream` needs to be improved to handle different input formats.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('use')[-1].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the get_new_command function should now correctly handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u arguments and the extraction of the push_upstream value, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
