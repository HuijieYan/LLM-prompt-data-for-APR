## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command's script parts. It then extracts the suggested git command from the stderr and replaces the 'push' command with the extracted suggested command in the original command's script parts.

## Potential error locations:
1. The use of try-except blocks for finding the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` could lead to incorrect results.
2. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` might not work as expected.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of try-except blocks and the incorrect condition for checking the value of `upstream_option_index`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a single try-except block for finding the index of either `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. Use `if upstream_option_index != -1` to check the value of `upstream_option_index`.

## Corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
