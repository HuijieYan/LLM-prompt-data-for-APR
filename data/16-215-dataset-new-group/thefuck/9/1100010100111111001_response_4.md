The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then extract the last part of the `stderr` message to use as the argument for the `git push` command. However, there are several issues with the function:

1. The code assumes that `command.script_parts` may include the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, but it should be the full command, including the script and the options.

2. The `upstream_option_index` is not being calculated correctly, as the second `try-except` block does not take into account the case where the `--set-upstream` option is not found and may overwrite the index.

3. After removing the option and its argument, the code is assuming that the `stderr` contains the correct command to use as an argument for the `git push` command, without considering that there might be other details such as remote and branch that need to be extracted.

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to properly identify the command, options, and arguments, then use that information to construct the new command, including the remote and branch.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    push_index = script_parts.index('push')

    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        option_index = -1

    if option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove the option
        script_parts.pop(option_index)  # Remove its argument

    # Extract the remote and branch from the stderr
    remote_branch = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' --set-upstream ')[1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', remote_branch)
```

With this corrected version, the function properly identifies the command, options, and arguments, then constructs the new command using the remote and branch extracted from the `stderr`. This version should pass all the failing test cases.
