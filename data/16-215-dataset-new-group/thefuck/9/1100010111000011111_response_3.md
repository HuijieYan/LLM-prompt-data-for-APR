The issue with the buggy function lies in the logic for finding and removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the git push command's script_parts. The function also incorrectly extracts the push_upstream value from the command.stderr, leading to incorrect output in the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't correctly handle the cases where --set-upstream or -u are passed as options, leading to incorrect removal of these options and faulty extraction of push_upstream.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for finding and removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command.script_parts and correctly extract the push_upstream value from the command.stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument from script_parts
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove argument as well
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove argument as well

    # Extract push_upstream from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    prefix = 'To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream '
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith(prefix):
            push_upstream = line[len(prefix):].strip()
            return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return " ".join(script_parts)
```

This corrected version handles the cases where --set-upstream or -u are passed as options, correctly removes these options and their arguments from the script_parts, and extracts the push_upstream value from the stderr. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test cases pass.
