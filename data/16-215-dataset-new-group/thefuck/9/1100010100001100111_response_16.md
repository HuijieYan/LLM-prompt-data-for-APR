The buggy function has a few issues that need to be fixed:
1. The logic to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command is incorrect.
2. The extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr is incorrect.
3. The replace_argument function is not being used correctly.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command, and the extraction of the push upstream command from the stderr. This leads to incorrect suggestions for the git push command.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Fix the logic to remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from the command by properly finding the index of these arguments and then removing them from the script_parts list.
2. Correctly extract the push upstream command by parsing the stderr to find the correct line and then extracting the suggested git push command.
3. Use the replace_argument function to replace the 'push' command with the correct push upstream command.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Removing --set-upstream or -u and its argument from the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    # Extracting the push upstream command properly
    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return None  # if push upstream command is not found
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the git push command and provide the correct suggestions based on the stderr message.
