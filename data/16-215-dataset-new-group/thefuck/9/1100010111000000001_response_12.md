To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the get_new_command function to correctly handle the removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and also correctly extract the push upstream from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the get_new_command function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument as well
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the updated version:
- We check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the command.script_parts and remove them along with their arguments if found.
- We extract the push upstream correctly from the stderr using split() and partition() functions.

With the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test cases provided.
