The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is used to modify the command while pushing to a git repository. The function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and its argument and replace it with the provided upstream branch. However, the code has an issue with removing the correct indexes of the options and their arguments resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to pop from the list of `script_parts`.

The failing test `test_get_new_command` provides different scenarios of using the `git push` command and the expected output after it's passed through the `get_new_command` function.

The `IndexError` is caused due to incorrect handling of indexes and popping elements from the `script_parts` list. This causes the incorrect modification of the git push command.

To fix the bug, the function `get_new_command` needs to correctly identify and remove the indexes for options and their arguments, and then replace the 'push' argument with the provided upstream branch.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
from thefuck.shells import shell

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return shell.And(' '.join(['git'] + command.script_parts).replace('push', f'push {push_upstream}'))
```

The corrected function correctly identifies the indexes of the options and their arguments, removes them from the `script_parts` list, and then replaces the 'push' argument with the provided upstream branch.

This corrected code should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
