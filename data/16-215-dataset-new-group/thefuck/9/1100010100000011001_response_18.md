## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, which may result in an incorrect command being generated in some cases.

The function first attempts to find the index of '--set-upstream' in the `command.script_parts` list. If not found, it then attempts to find the index of '-u'. However, the bug is that if the `'-u'` option is found, it removes the wrong index from the `command.script_parts`, and also it removes the index twice (which is incorrect). Additionally, the method of extracting `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` is also not correct.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command. We also need to correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`. Finally, we should construct the new command with the correct format.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
