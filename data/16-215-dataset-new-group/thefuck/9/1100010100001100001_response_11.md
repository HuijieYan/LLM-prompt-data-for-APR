The bug in the code is that the `upstream_option_index` is incorrectly used to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command. The problem is that if the `--set-upstream` option is used, the index will be recorded properly, but if the `-u` option is used, it will overwrite the `upstream_option_index` with that index. Additionally, the subsequent pop operations will still use the original index.

A potential strategy to fix this bug is instead of using two try-except blocks to find the index of both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, we can use a single if-else block to check for both and then perform the pop operations based on the respective index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
