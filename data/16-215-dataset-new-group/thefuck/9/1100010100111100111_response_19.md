## Correction

Looking at the error message, it seems that the index `upstream_option_index` is getting out of range when trying to pop from the `command.script_parts`. This is likely due to the fact that the `-u` option was being detected and removed, but then the index was being used again when it shouldn't have been.

To fix this, we need to properly handle the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and then extract the correct push command without getting the index out of range.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This version of the function properly handles the removal of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and should no longer encounter the index out of range error.
