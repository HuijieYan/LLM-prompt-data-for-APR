The buggy function is designed to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the git push command. It then retrieves the suggested git push command and replaces the "push" argument with the retrieved value.

The potential error in the function is that it assumes that the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option will always be present in the command. This may lead to index errors and incorrect parsing of the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle cases where the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is not present in the command. This results in the buggy function not behaving as expected and causing it to fail the test.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is present in the command before attempting to remove it. If it is not present, we can proceed with the original command without any modifications. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the push_upstream value is not retrieved from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    push_command = "git push"
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream_line = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    push_upstream = push_upstream_line.partition('git ')[2] if 'git' in push_upstream_line else 'origin master'

    return f"{push_command} {push_upstream}"
```

The corrected function checks if the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is present and removes it if found. It then retrieves the push_upstream value from the stderr, and if not found, defaults to 'origin master'.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
