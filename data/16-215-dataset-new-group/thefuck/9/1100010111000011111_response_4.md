The buggy function 'get_new_command' is designed to handle the 'git push' command, specifically removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments from the command and then replacing the 'push' argument with the suggested value provided by the 'git' command. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The code to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments seems to be incorrect.
2. The code to extract the suggested push command after 'git push' is not working properly.

The cause of the bug is that the extraction of the suggested push command after 'git push' from the error message is not accurate, causing the replacement argument function to produce incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code accurately removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments while also accurately extracting the suggested push command from the error message. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = " ".join(command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[1:])
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, I have added conditions to check if '--set-upstream' or '-u' is in the command's script parts and using the split method to accurately extract the suggested push command from the error message. These changes should address the issues and make the function produce the correct output for the given test cases.
