The bug in the function is that it is not removing both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` as intended. Additionally, the `push_upstream` variable is being extracted incorrectly, resulting in the wrong value.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. When checking for the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, after removing the elements at `upstream_option_index`, it should decrement the index and then remove the element at that index, otherwise it skips the next element inadvertently.
2. The `push_upstream` value should be extracted correctly from the `command.stderr` response.


Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, 
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the '--set-upstream' option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the associated argument
    except ValueError:
        pass  # If '--set-upstream' is not found, continue to the next check

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the '-u' option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the associated argument
    except ValueError:
        pass  # If '-u' is not found, continue to the next step

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('git ')[-1].strip()  # Correctly extract the push_upstream from the stderr
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
