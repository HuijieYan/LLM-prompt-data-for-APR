The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` because the code is trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts` using the index `upstream_option_index`, which is not being properly calculated and results in an index out of range.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not properly checking for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. It only checks for one and then attempts to remove elements based on the index of that option, which may not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to properly check for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and then remove them if found. Additionally, we should handle the case where the `stderr` does not contain the expected information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    stderr_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_parts) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_parts[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None
```

With this correction, the function should handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options properly, and also properly handle the case where the `stderr` does not contain the expected information.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
