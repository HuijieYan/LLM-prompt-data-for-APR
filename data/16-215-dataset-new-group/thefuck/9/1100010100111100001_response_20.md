The buggy function has several issues. The first issue is that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options should be checked to get the `upstream_option_index` and process its removal accordingly. The second issue is that the checks for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options aren't distinct and override the `upstream_option_index` value. Finally, the pop method is called twice on the `command.script_parts`, but it should be called only once as removing the option at `upstream_option_index` would also delete its argument.

To fix the issues, a strategy would be to check for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and remove their arguments if any. Also, the removal of an element from the list should be done only once, considering the correct index where it's located.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected function, its behavior should address all possible cases and pass the failing test.
