The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the git push command, and return a new command with the updated arguments. However, there are several potential error locations in the function that could cause bugs.

Potential errors:
1. The use of `is not` in the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` could cause a bug. It should be `!=` instead of `is not`.
2. If the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not found in the command, an index error could occur when trying to remove the option and its argument.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` to `if upstream_option_index != -1`.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the index error if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except IndexError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
