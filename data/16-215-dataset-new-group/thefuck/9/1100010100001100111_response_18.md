The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by the incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream/-u` option. The function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream/-u` option and its argument from the command and replace the `push` argument with the correct upstream branch. However, in the current implementation, the `pop` method is incorrectly used to remove the option and its argument, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the `--set-upstream/-u` option is present in the command and then handle the removal and replacement of the push argument correctly. We should also account for cases where the command does not include the `--set-upstream/-u` option. Additionally, we should use the `splitlines` method instead of `split('\n')` to split the stderr message and retrieve the correct upstream branch.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None  # Do nothing if the option is not present

    remote_branch = command.stderr.splitlines()[-3].split()[-1].strip()
    new_command = command.script_parts[:]
    new_command.pop(upstream_option_index)
    new_command.pop(upstream_option_index)

    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command), 'push', remote_branch)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `--set-upstream/-u` option is present in the command, and if so, we find the index of the option. We then split the stderr message to extract the correct upstream branch. Finally, we create a new command by copying the original command's parts, remove the `--set-upstream/-u` option and its argument, and replace the `push` argument with the correct upstream branch.

This should address the bug and provide the correct command suggestion for `git push --set-upstream/-u`.
