The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly removes the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the function extracts the correct push upstream command from the `command.stderr` string but fails to clean it up properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function removes both instances of the upstream option `-u` from the `command.script_parts` list, which leads to incorrect modification of the command. It also extracts the push upstream command from the `command.stderr` string but does not properly handle the string manipulation.

To fix the bug, we should first find the index of the upstream option (`-u`) in the `command.script_parts` list and remove it with its argument, if present. Then, we should properly extract the push upstream command from the `command.stderr` string and only take the necessary part of it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we only remove the first occurrence of the upstream option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we properly extract the push upstream command from the `command.stderr` string using the `partition` method to get the correct part of the string.

This fix should address the bug and provide the correct suggestions for the `git push` command with the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
