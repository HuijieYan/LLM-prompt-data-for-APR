The issue with the buggy function `get_new_command` is that it is incorrectly finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `command.script_parts`. Also, it incorrectly extracts the push command from the `command.stderr`. The algorithm is based on finding the `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` and using the third to last line of `command.stderr` to identify the push command. 

The correction is to first find the part of the command that is to be replaced and then use `replace_argument` to replace it with the correct push command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    push_command = 'git push'  # Default push command
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            command.script_parts.pop(i)
            if i < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
                command.script_parts.pop(i)  # Remove the argument
        elif part == 'push':
            push_command += ' ' + ' '.join(command.script_parts[i + 1:])  # Concatenate all other parts after push
            
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_command)
```

In this corrected version, we loop through the command to find the push command and also handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options more accurately.
