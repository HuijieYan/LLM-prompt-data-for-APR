The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and its argument from the command and replace the `push` argument with the value obtained from the stderr of the command.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and its argument, and the retrieval of the `push_upstream` from the command stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the function improperly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, resulting in incorrect index manipulation and slicing.

To fix the bug, the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and its argument should be handled separately and more accurately, and the retrieval of `push_upstream` should be modified to retrieve the correct value from the command stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument if present
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original list
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and its argument and retrieves the correct value for `push_upstream` from the command stderr.
