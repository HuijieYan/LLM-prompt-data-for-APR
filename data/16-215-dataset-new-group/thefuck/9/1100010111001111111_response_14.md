The bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `git push` command. The function is designed to remove these options and their arguments from the command output, as they are concatenated onto the command suggested by git. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly strip off these options, resulting in incorrect suggestions for the new command.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the try-except blocks that attempt to find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The issue is causing incorrect removal of these options and their arguments from the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `command.script_parts` list. This leads to incorrect removal of these options and their arguments, resulting in incorrect suggestions for the new command.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly find the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and then remove them along with their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u options
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function correctly identifies and removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, and returns the expected new command.
