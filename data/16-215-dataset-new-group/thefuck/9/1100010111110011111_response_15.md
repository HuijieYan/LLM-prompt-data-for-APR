The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to pop from the `command.script_parts` list without checking if the index exists. This is causing an IndexError in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we check if the index exists before trying to remove it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if index still exists after popping
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issues posted in GitHub. The corrected function checks if the index exists before trying to remove it from the list.
