The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is executed when git push is called. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` at line 27 in the function. This signifies that the index used with `command.script_parts.pop()` is out of range.

The cause of the bug is that the `pop()` method is called twice, which creates the out of range index error when called the second time.
To fix the bug, one of the `pop()` calls should be replaced with a `del` statement to ensure that the item is removed from the `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, the second `pop()` call has been replaced with `del` statement to remove the item at the specified index to avoid the `IndexError`.
