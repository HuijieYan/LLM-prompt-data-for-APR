The bug in the function `get_new_command` is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list that does not exist. This is caused by the logic to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The issue is related to suggestion for `git push -u` causing an incorrect outcome after a merge that caused the bug #538.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. Also, considering the failing test, we should ensure it handles both `git push` and `git push -u` commands and provide correct suggestions for both scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None # No need to modify the command

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    command.script_parts.pop(index)
    command.script_parts.pop(index)
    
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle both `git push` and `git push -u` commands correctly and provide the expected suggestions.
