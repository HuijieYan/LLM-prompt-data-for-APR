## Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its parameter from the command, and then replace the `push` argument with the value extracted from the command's stderr. The bug seems to be in the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its parameter.

## Bug
The bug is in the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its parameter. The function is not correctly removing both the argument and its value from the `command.script_parts`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly remove both the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the `command.script_parts` list.

## The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument value as well
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument value as well
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
