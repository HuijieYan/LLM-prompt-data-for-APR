The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then replace the `push` command with `push` and its argument.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Using `command.script_parts.index` without checking if the option `-u` or `--set-upstream` exists in the command.
2. Incorrect usage of the `is not` operator to check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1.
3. The logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments might not work as expected because it always removes the element at the same index regardless of the option's placement.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options exist in the command before trying to remove them. Additionally, the logic to remove the options and their arguments is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option exists in the command before trying to remove it.
2. Use a more robust method to remove the options and their arguments from the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are present in the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the push upstream from the command stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace the 'push' command with 'push' and its argument
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` options exist in the command before trying to remove them. Then, we use the `remove()` method to remove the options from the `script_parts` list. After that, we extract the push upstream from the command stderr and replace the 'push' command with 'push' and its argument.
