The buggy function has a bug in its logic of indexing. In the try-except block for finding the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u`, the code does not handle the case where both options are present. Also, after checking with `is not -1`, it tries to pop the index twice, which results in an `IndexError` when it doesn't find the index. 

The buggy code tries to accommodate for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags to be present in the `command.script_parts`, and it assumes an ordering between the flags and their corresponding arguments. However, this is not always the case as the user might input these without respecting the intended order.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic by directly checking if either of the flags exists in the `command.script_parts`, and then removing them along with their arguments from the list. After that, we can extract the required part from `stderr` to build the new command. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
        elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
    except (ValueError, IndexError):
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
