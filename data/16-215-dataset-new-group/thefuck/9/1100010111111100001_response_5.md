The bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the `command.script_parts` list. The bug causes an `IndexError` due to the attempt to remove elements from the list that have already been removed in previous iterations.

The cause of the bug is that the `pop` operation is used to remove the elements from the `command.script_parts` list without checking whether the elements exist in the list. Additionally, the removal logic is incorrect as it is removing the same index twice when the flags are found.

To fix the bug, we need to validate whether the flags exist in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove them. If both flags are found, we should only remove the first occurrence.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this change, the `get_new_command` function should pass the failing test and work correctly by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the command parts list and returning the updated command.
