The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command. Additionally, it is incorrectly extracting the suggested command to push the current branch and set the remote as upstream from the stderr message.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command, and it is also not properly parsing the suggested push command from the stderr message.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command, as well as extract the correct push command from the stderr message.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the suggested push command from the stderr message
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-2:]
    push_upstream = ' '.join(push_upstream)
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present and extract the correct push command from the stderr message.
