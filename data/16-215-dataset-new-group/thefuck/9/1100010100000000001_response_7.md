The potential error locations within the buggy function are: 
1. The conditional check for `upstream_option_index` is incorrect (`is not -1` should be `!= -1`)
2. The pop operation is removing the same element twice

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect conditional check for `upstream_option_index` and the incorrect usage of the `pop` operation.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional check for `upstream_option_index` and ensure that the pop operation only removes the element once.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
In the corrected version, the conditional check for `upstream_option_index` has been fixed, and the pop operation has been adjusted to remove the argument only once.
