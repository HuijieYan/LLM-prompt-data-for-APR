The buggy function is `get_new_command`. The function is supposed to remove the --set-upstream or -u option from the command being passed and its argument since the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git. The error message indicates an IndexError: pop index out of range.

The bug is caused because when trying to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, the pop method is used twice in this line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. The issue is that if `upstream_option_index` represents the position of --set-upstream, then popping once will shift the position of -u and it might go out of range.

A strategy to fix this bug is to instead use the `del` keyword to remove the items at the `upstream_option_index` and `upstream_option_index + 1` positions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
