To fix the buggy function, `get_new_command`, we need to address the following issues:

1. The function incorrectly searches for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument within `command.script_parts`, but it doesn't handle the case where the argument is included as a separate element in the list.
2. The function always returns a fixed replacement string, `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, instead of dynamically determining the replacement value based on the content of `command.stderr`. This doesn't satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should:
- Fix the logic for identifying and removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`.
- Modify the replacement strategy based on `command.stderr` to get the correct replacement value for the `push` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument from command.script_parts if present
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            if i + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(i + 1)
            command.script_parts.pop(i)

    # Extract the correct push command from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split()[-1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
