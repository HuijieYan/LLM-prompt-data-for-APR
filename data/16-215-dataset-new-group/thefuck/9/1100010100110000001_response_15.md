The buggy function is `get_new_command`, used to process the command 'git push -u' in a specific case. The function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the command used by `git push`. Then, it retrieves the suggestion for the command from the stderr provided and replaces the 'push' argument in the command with the suggestion.

The error message shows that there is an `IndexError` that happens when trying to pop the element from `command.script_parts`.

The cause of the bug is that after removing the element at `upstream_option_index`, the list `command.script_parts` lost an element and thus when trying to remove it again at the same index, it results in an `IndexError` as the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the first element is removed, the second element's index should be adjusted to prevent an `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the --set-upstream or -u argument
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if the index is within the bounds
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument value
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this fixed version, after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument, it checks if the index is still within the bounds of the list before trying to remove the argument value. This avoids the `IndexError` that occurred previously.
