The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to provide a corrected version of the `git push` command. The function aims to handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags by removing them and returning a new command with the corrected upstream link. However, the function contains an error when handling the removal of the upstream flag and its argument.

The failing test function, `test_get_new_command`, aims to validate the behavior of the `get_new_command` function under various scenarios. The error message is an `IndexError` that occurs while attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag from the list of script parts in the command.

The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect handling of removing the upstream flag and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The function currently attempts to remove the upstream flag twice, regardless of whether it was found or not, which leads to an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, the strategy would be to correctly handle the removal of the upstream flag and its argument. This can be achieved by checking if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before removing the elements from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the `IndexError` will be resolved, and the failing test is expected to pass.
