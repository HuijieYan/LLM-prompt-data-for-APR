Looking at the error message:

- The failing test has an AssertionError at `assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)) == "git push --set-upstream origin master"`
- The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27 in `git_push.py` file.
- The error message points out that the pop index is out of range.

The potential error location within the buggy function is at the lines:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

The cause of the bug is that the wrong index is being used for popping the `command.script_parts`. This results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, the code needs to ensure that the correct index is used for popping the command script parts. Additionally, the logic for handling `--set-upstream` and `-u` needs to be modified to correctly remove it and its argument. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = list(command.script_parts)  # Create a copy to avoid mutating the original list
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function creates a copy of the `command.script_parts` to avoid modifying the original list, then uses the `script_parts` list for index operations. After removing the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, it correctly replaces the `push` argument and resolves the error.
