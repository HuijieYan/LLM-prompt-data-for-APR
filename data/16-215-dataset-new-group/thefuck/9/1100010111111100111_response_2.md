The bug in the `get_new_command` function occurs because the code is attempting to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the `command.script_parts` list without considering the subsequent elements in the list.

The error message indicates an `IndexError`, specifically `IndexError: pop index out of range`, which means that the code is attempting to pop an element from the list at an index that is out of the range of the list's indices.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to properly handle the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and their subsequent arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. We also need to parse the correct push target from the error message `stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    new_script_parts = []
    remove_next = False
    for part in command.script_parts:
        if remove_next:
            remove_next = False
        elif part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            remove_next = True
        else:
            new_script_parts.append(part)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function now properly iterates through the `command.script_parts` list and creates a new list without the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and their subsequent arguments. Additionally, it correctly parses the push target from the error message `stderr`.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
