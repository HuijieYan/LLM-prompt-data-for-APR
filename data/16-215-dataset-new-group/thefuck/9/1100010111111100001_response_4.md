The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly trying to remove the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their corresponding arguments from the command input. This results in the function accessing indices that are not valid, leading to an `IndexError`. 

To fix this bug, we need to re-implement the function to correctly identify these options and their positions in the command input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    updated_parts = []
    skip_next = False
    for index, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if skip_next:
            skip_next = False
            continue
        if part == '--set-upstream' or part == '-u':
            skip_next = True
            continue
        updated_parts.append(part)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(updated_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass without any `IndexError` during execution.
