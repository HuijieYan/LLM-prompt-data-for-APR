The buggy function `get_new_command` has several issues:
1. The code to remove the "--set-upstream" argument and its value using the index of `script_parts` is causing issues.
2. The `split` operation on `command.stderr` is unreliable because it assumes that the second last line will always have the required information; this might not always be the case.

The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is used without checking if it is still valid after popping elements from `script_parts`. This leads to incorrect values of `push_upstream` being derived, and hence the failing tests.

A potential correction strategy is as follows:
1. Save the argument and its value before removing them for later use using `split`.
2. Find the index of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option, and then remove both the argument and its value simultaneously from `script_parts`.
3. Use the earlier saved argument and value to replace the "push" argument in the final command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    splits = push_upstream.split()
    
    upstream_option_index = -1
    upstream_pattern_index = -1
    for index, split in enumerate(splits):
        if split in ["--set-upstream", "-u"]:
            upstream_option_index = index
            upstream_pattern_index = index
            break
            
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        splits.pop(upstream_pattern_index)
        splits.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    new_command = "git push " + " ".join(splits)
    
    return new_command
```

This corrected version is expected to satisfy the failing tests provided.
