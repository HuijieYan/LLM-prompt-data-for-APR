The buggy function `get_new_command` has a few issues. It tries to locate the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list and then remove the option and its argument if found. Additionally, it extracts the upstream branch from the last line of the `command.stderr` and constructs the new command by replacing the 'push' argument with the upstream branch.

However, the cause of the bug is that when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, the index is used incorrectly. Instead, it should remove two elements when found at the identified index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument from the command
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its corresponding argument from the command and construct the new command based on the extracted upstream branch, passing the provided test cases.
