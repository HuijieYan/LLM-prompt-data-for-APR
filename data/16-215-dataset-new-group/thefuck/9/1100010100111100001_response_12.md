The buggy function has an issue with the way it handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags from the `command.script_parts` list. The problem is with the use of `pop`, which is causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove elements beyond the list's bounds.

To fix this, we need to check for the existence of the flags first and then remove them using the correct index. We should also modify the extraction of `push_upstream` to avoid any potential issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the `-u` and `--set-upstream` flags correctly, and the failing test case should pass.
