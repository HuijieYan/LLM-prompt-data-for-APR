The buggy function is designed to modify a git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and then replacing 'push' with the suggested remote and branch. However, the function uses the wrong index to remove the option and its argument from the 'command.script_parts' list, leading to incorrect behavior and results.

The cause of the bug is that the code incorrectly removes the argument with the index directly, without considering that the second 'pop' operation should account for the change in list length after the initial removal.

To fix the bug, we can ensure that the command.script_parts are updated correctly using slicing method or remove the elements using the pop() method with the correct index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the removal of the elements from the list using the correct index and also correct the use of try-except blocks to properly handle the presence of the --set-upstream or -u option in the git push command.
