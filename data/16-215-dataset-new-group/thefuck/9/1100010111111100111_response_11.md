The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts`. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the option from the `command.script_parts`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove the option from the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument if present

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts`, resolving the `IndexError` and ensuring the function passes the failing test.
