The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which aims to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags, along with their respective arguments. Then it assigns to `push_upstream` the git command from the stderr by stripping 'git' and keeping everything past it. Finally, it replaces the 'push' command with the `push_upstream` value.

The failing test is focused on testing command alterations by simulating different inputs and asserts the expected outputs. The buggy function fails to meet these assertions and raises an IndexError stating "pop index out of range".

The root of the issue is that the buggy function is trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list without ensuring the existence of these elements or considering that it may lead to an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the elements we are about to pop are present in the list before performing the pop operation.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test successfully.
