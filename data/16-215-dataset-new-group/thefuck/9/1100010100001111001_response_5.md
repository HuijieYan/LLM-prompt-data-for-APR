The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command, then concatenate the suggested git command with the remaining arguments.

The bug arises from incorrectly removing the upstream option and its argument when it's present. This is caused by the use of `pop` with the upstream_option_index value, which might cause the wrong element to be removed from the list.

To fix the bug, use the `pop` method to remove the specific elements from the list and adjust the index accordingly. Additionally, it's important to check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command before trying to remove them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
