The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it is used to fix suggestions for `git push -u origin`. The bug occurs when handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command. The bug causes incorrect suggestions for the `git push -u` command.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The handling of the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument.
2. Parsing the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and also incorrectly parses the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Use the correct conditional check when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument.
2. Use a more reliable method to parse the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script:
        upstream_option_index = command.script.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script:
        upstream_option_index = command.script.index('-u')
        command.script.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script), 'push', push_upstream)
```
In the corrected version, the function now handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument correctly, and also parses the `push_upstream` value more reliably from the command's stderr.
