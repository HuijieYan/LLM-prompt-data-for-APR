The bug in the function is causing an IndexError when trying to pop an element from the command.script_parts list. The expected input values for the failing test are as follows:

- command.script_parts: should have the value ['git', 'push', '-u']
- command.stderr: should have the value 'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'

The expected output values for the failing test are as follows:

- upstream_option_index: expected value: -1, type: int
- push_upstream: expected value: 'push --set-upstream origin master', type: str

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to pop elements from the command.script_parts list without checking if the elements exist.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the pop index exists in the list before trying to remove it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
