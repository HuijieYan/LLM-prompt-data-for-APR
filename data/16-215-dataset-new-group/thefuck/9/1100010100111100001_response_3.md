The bug in the `get_new_command` function originates from the `-u` option not being removed from the `command.script_parts` list even after identifying its index through the `command.script_parts.index('-u')` code block. When `-u` is removed from the list, the subsequent removal of its corresponding value results in an IndexError: pop index out of range, causing the function to crash.

To fix this bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. After identifying the index of the `-u` option in the `command.script_parts` list, removing it from the list to ensure that the subsequent removal of its corresponding argument does not result in an IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the '-u' option
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the corresponding argument
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the `get_new_command` function now includes proper removal of the `-u` option and its corresponding argument, resolving the IndexError issue and ensuring that the function works as expected.
