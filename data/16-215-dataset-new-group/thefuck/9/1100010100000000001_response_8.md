## The problem with the buggy function

The buggy function `get_new_command` has several potential error locations. The first issue is that it is using `try-except` blocks to find the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts`. If both options are present, it will only remove the last one found, which could lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` would never evaluate to `False` because it is comparing an integer to `-1` using `is` which checks for object identity, rather than equality.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we can use a different approach to find and remove the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`. We can also handle the case where both options are present. Additionally, we can improve the condition for checking the presence of the upstream option.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
