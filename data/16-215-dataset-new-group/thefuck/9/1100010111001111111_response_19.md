The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is present in the command, causing it to incorrectly remove these options and their arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the function directly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their respective arguments without checking if they are followed by additional arguments. This leads to incorrect command construction when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not the last in the command.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to search for the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, and if found, remove them along with their arguments. Then construct the new command by appending the correct `--set-upstream origin master` part to the existing command, taking into account any other parameters present.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are passed, and if so, remove them and their argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument of --set-upstream
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument of -u

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = " ".join(command.script_parts)
    if push_upstream:
        new_command = f"{new_command} --set-upstream {push_upstream}"
    return new_command
```
This corrected version first checks if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command and removes them and their respective arguments. Then, it constructs the new command by appending the correct `--set-upstream origin master` part to the existing command, taking into account any other parameters present.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the specific issue raised in GitHub related to the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u origin`.
