The cause of the bug is that the buggy function tries to remove the elements from the `command.script_parts` list by pop operation when the elements are not present in the list. This results in an IndexError as the index to pop is out of range.

To fix the bug, we can first check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `script_parts` list, then remove it and its argument if it's found. This can be done using the `remove` method if the element exists in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            command.script_parts.remove(option)
            # Also remove the argument of the option if present
            if command.script_parts.index(option) < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
                command.script_parts.pop(command.script_parts.index(option) + 1)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By using the `remove` method, we can avoid the IndexError when the element to remove is not present in the list.
