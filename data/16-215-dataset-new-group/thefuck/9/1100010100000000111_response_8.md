def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] != "push":
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it doesn't handle the case where the "-u" option is used with "git push" and leads to incorrect command suggestions. It also doesn't properly handle the case where "--set-upstream" or "-u" options are passed.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function checks if the upstream_option_index is not equal to -1 and then pops both the "--set-upstream" or "-u" and the next argument if it's not "push". This ensures that the correct arguments are removed when the options are present.

Additionally, the corrected version also includes a check to ensure that the "push" command is not also removed when handling the upstream options.

This fixes the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
