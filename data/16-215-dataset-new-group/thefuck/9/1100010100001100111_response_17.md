The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts`, the function incorrectly removes these options and their arguments. This leads to incorrect output when trying to suggest a new git push command.

The cause of the bug is that when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, the function does not take into account that the commands are being concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes these options and their arguments. This leads to incorrect manipulation of the command script parts.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, and then concatenate the remaining commands onto the command suggested by git.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return None

    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts`. Then, we remove the options and their arguments. Finally, we concatenate the remaining commands onto the command suggested by git. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and provide the correct new git push command suggestions.
