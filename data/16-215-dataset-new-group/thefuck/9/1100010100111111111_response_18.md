The cause of the bug is that the script_parts list is being modified by popping elements from it, and in the case of the failing test with 'git push -u', the pop operation is causing an IndexError because there is no element at the specified index. This is due to the fact that when '-u' is present in the command, the previous attempt to find '--set-upstream' also modifies the script_parts list.

To fix the bug, we need to handle both conditions of finding '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately without modifying the command.script_parts list until we have the correct index to pop from.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Pop again to remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version handles the conditions of finding '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately and only performs the pop operation when the correct index is found. This way, it avoids modifying the list in an inconsistent manner, which was causing the IndexError.
