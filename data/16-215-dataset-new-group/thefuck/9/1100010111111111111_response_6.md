The bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are passed. The buggy function is erroneously using `pop()` twice on the `command.script_parts` list after finding the index of the option, which leads to an `IndexError` in some cases when the option is not found at the expected index.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to modify the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we need to parse the correct parameter for the new command from the `stderr` provided in the `Command` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub.

I have also considered the issue on GitHub in my fix for the bug.
