## Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to handle the git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command. However, there are potential errors in the way it searches for the index of the --set-upstream or -u option and in removing these options from the command.

## Potential error locations:
1. The use of `.index()` to find the index of --set-upstream or -u may result in a ValueError if the option is not found, leading to an unhandled exception and incorrect behavior.
2. The removal of the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command could be done incorrectly due to indexing issues.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug likely arises from the unhandled exceptions when using `.index()` to find the index of --set-upstream or -u. If the option is not found, a ValueError will be raised, causing the program to skip the second search for the other option. Additionally, the removal of the option and its argument may not be done correctly, leading to a malformed command.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more robust method to search for the --set-upstream or -u option within the command without relying on `.index()` to prevent unhandled exceptions.
2. Ensure that the removal of the option and its argument is done correctly by considering the correct indices within the list of command parts.

## Corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument from the command
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    try:
        upstream_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_index = -1
    try:
        u_index = script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        u_index = -1

    if upstream_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
    elif u_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(u_index)
        script_parts.pop(u_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, the function first creates a copy of script_parts to avoid modifying the original list. It then uses a try-except block to look for both --set-upstream and -u options, removing them and their arguments if found. This prevents unhandled exceptions and ensures the correct indices are used for removal.
