The issue with the buggy function is that it does not correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command, and does not use the correct push upstream information. Instead of utilizing the output from `stderr`, it simply removes the option from the script parts and then tries to construct the new command with incorrect push upstream information.

The fix for the bug would be to correctly extract the push upstream information and use it in the revised command. Additionally, these if checks should be combined and a separate process should be implemented to extract the push upstream information. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return f"{' '.join(command_parts)} {push_upstream}"
```

This fixed version of the function takes into account the existence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option, removes it from the command parts, and then correctly constructs the new command with the push upstream information.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing tests provided.
