The buggy function `get_new_command` is failing in the test function `test_get_new_command` with the error message `IndexError: pop index out of range`. The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and its argument. The issue is related to a recent change in the function that has resulted in the incorrect behavior for the `git push -u` command.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect removal of the elements from `command.script_parts` when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found. The buggy function also fails to handle the scenario when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the command.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the function should handle the scenario when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the command to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version includes separate handling for `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and also includes a check to ensure that the argument is removed alongside the option. Additionally, it checks if the option is present before trying to remove it from the `command.script_parts` to avoid the IndexError.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases provided.
