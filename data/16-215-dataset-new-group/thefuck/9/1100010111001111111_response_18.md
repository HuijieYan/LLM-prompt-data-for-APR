To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is set incorrectly, as it always takes the value of the last index where the '-u' flag is found, regardless of whether '--set-upstream' is also present in the command.
2. The `command.script_parts.pop` lines are not removing the correct elements from the list.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify how the `upstream_option_index` is determined, so it considers both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags.
2. We need to remove the correct elements from `command.script_parts` when either '--set-upstream' or '-u' is present.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the flag
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it addresses the issue posted on GitHub related to the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u` commands.
