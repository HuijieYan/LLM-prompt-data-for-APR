The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `command.script_parts` elements at indices `upstream_option_index` and `upstream_option_index` after each `try-except` block. When the `upstream_option_index` is found, it should only be removed once, but the current buggy code erroneously removes it twice. This results in the `IndexError: pop index out of range` as observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should update the `if upstream_option_index is not -1` block to only remove the elements once by checking if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to `-1`, and either use `remove` method directly, or use `pop` method, but only once. Secondly, the `push_upstream` indication needs fixing as it currently includes the `push` as part of the old command script, which is incorrect. We need to replace this part with the new push command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        new_command = replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
        return new_command
    else:
        return ' '.join(command.script_parts)
```
