The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` and not correctly removing the upstream options from the command script parts.

The buggy function `get_new_command` attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script parts. Then it extracts the push upstream value from the command stderr and replaces the argument in the script.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and remove it from the command script parts.
2. Extract the push upstream value from the command stderr.
3. Replace the argument in the script with the correct push upstream value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle the removal of the upstream options and generate the correct new command based on the push upstream value.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub (#538) and make the failing test cases pass.
