The buggy function has a few issues:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is always initialized as -1, which means the subsequent checks for '--set-upstream' and '-u' won't work as expected.
2. The pop operation is removing the elements from the `command.script_parts` list, which affects the subsequent concatenation of the new command.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `get_new_command` function to correctly identify the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and then update the `command.script_parts` list appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it should resolve the GitHub issue by providing the correct new command suggestions for 'git push -u'.
