I identified the bug in the given buggy function:

1. The function aims to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the input command and get the remaining arguments to be concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option. However, the implementation removes the options incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior.

2. The strategy for fixing the bug is to correct the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument. Additionally, the extraction of the suggested command should be revised to ensure it is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function incorporating the fixes:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('git ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The revisions include:
1. Corrected the logic for identifying the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the input command.
2. Corrected the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument.
3. Revised the extraction of the suggested command to ensure it accurately captures the desired portion.

These changes should address the identified bug and improve the function's behavior.
