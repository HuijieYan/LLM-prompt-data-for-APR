The bug in the function `get_new_command` lies in the way it handles the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. The function is removing these options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list, and then extracting the suggested command from the `stderr` output. However, in the cases where the `-u` option is present, the function is not correctly handling the removal of the argument following the `-u` option.

To fix this bug, we need to first identify the correct index of the option and then remove the option along with its argument. Additionally, we need to extract the correct suggested command from the `stderr` output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].lstrip('push ')  # Extract the suggested command
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the `-u` option and provide the expected output for all the failing test cases. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures that the function behaves as intended.
