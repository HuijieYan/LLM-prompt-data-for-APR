The cause of the bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the git push command, and it is not extracting the correct push upstream value from the stderr. This is causing the failing test to produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic to properly handle the removal of the options, and extract the correct push upstream value from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    new_command_parts = command.script_parts[:]  # Create a copy of the script parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = new_command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = new_command_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        new_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the -u or --set-upstream option
        new_command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
