The buggy function is failing because it is trying to remove an item from the `command.script_parts` list using the `pop` method with an index that is out of range. This is causing the `IndexError: pop index out of range` error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case when the argument to be removed is not present in the list. When the argument is not found, the index value remains -1, which should be checked before attempting to remove the item from the list.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to remove the item from the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version first checks if `upstream_option_index` is not -1, and then proceeds to remove the item from the list only if the list has enough elements.

This fix will ensure that the function handles the case correctly when the argument to be removed is not present in the list, and it should pass all the failing tests.
