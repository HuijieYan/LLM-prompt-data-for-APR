Explanation of bug:
The bug occurs because the condition for checking the value of `upstream_option_index` is incorrect. The comparison `upstream_option_index is not -1` is not the correct way to check if the index was found. Instead, it should be `upstream_option_index != -1`. Additionally, the pop operations should only be executed if the index is found.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition for checking `upstream_option_index` to `!= -1`.
2. Only execute the pop operations if the index is found.
