The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it is failing to handle the case when the command has the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. The buggy function is trying to remove these options from the `command.script_parts` list, but it is not handling the case properly when the options are not present. This is causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove elements from the list that do not exist.

The bug is causing the function to return an incorrect command, failing the test cases, and leading to the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove them. If they are present, then remove them from the list. If not, then the function should handle it gracefully without causing an error.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are present and remove them
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options properly, resulting in the expected output for the failing test cases.
