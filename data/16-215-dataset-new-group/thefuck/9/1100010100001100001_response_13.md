The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is being set for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately and might result in incorrect pop operations on the list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct index is tracked and removed. We also need to fix the calculation of `push_upstream`, as it is returning an incorrect value for the correct git push command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
            pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The changes made are:
1. The removal of the `upstream_option_index` declaration and assignment, as we will directly handle it inside the try-except blocks.
2. Added a check in each block to ensure that if one index is found successfully, we won't check for the other as both are mutually exclusive.
3. Correct index and argument are removed using `pop` according to the found `upstream_option_index`.
4. `push_upstream` is correctly calculated by partitioning the git push command and taking the third part.

With these changes, the function should now work correctly for all cases provided.
