The buggy function has multiple issues. First, it tries to find the index of the '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags in the command.script_parts list, but it doesn't handle them correctly. Second, it uses the stderr message to extract the suggested push command, which is unreliable.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the stderr message always provides the correct push command to be used. However, this assumption is incorrect, as the stderr message could change or not be present in some cases.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly construct the push command based on the branch name and remote instead of relying on the stderr message. Additionally, the logic for handling the '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags should be revised to ensure that they are correctly removed from the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Construct the push command based on the branch name and remote
    branch_name = command.script_parts[-1]
    remote = command.script_parts[-2]
    push_command = f'git push {remote} {branch_name}'
    return push_command
```

In the corrected function, the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags are removed if present, and the push command is constructed based on the branch name and remote. This approach ensures that the function correctly handles different scenarios and avoids using unreliable information from the stderr message.
