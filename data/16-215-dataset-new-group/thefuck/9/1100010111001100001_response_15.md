The buggy function `get_new_command` has a few issues. It is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and replace it with the last line from `command.stderr` which contains the correct push command.

The issues in the function are as follows:
1. `upstream_option_index` is always initialized to -1, which means neither of the if conditions will be satisfied. This leads to the indices never being removed before concatenating to the command again.
2. The last line from `command.stderr` is supposed to be fetched to retrieve the correct `push_upstream` command, but the partition of 'git ' is adding unnecessary characters to the output.

To address these issues, you can resolve the `upstream_option_index` problem by checking both '--set-upstream' and '-u' flags separately using two if conditions.
Additionally, updating the `push_upstream` retrieval line to fetch the correct command can resolve the second issue.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('git ')[1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
