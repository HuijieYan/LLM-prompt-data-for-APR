The buggy function has multiple issues that could result in incorrect behavior:

1. The code does not handle the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is not found in the command, which could lead to index errors when trying to remove these options from the command.
2. The code references a specific line in the command's stderr output (`command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]`), which could be error-prone if the format of the stderr output changes.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is not found more gracefully, and also find a more robust way to extract the push command from the stderr output.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument if present
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove the argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)  # remove the argument

    # Extract the push command from the stderr output
    push_command = None
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('To push the current branch') and line.endswith('use'):
            parts = line.split(' ')
            push_command = parts[-2]
            break

    if push_command:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_command)
    else:
        return None  # No push command found, cannot generate a new command
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is present, and if so, remove it along with its argument. Then, we iterate through the stderr output to find the push command, providing a more robust way to extract the command.

This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and provide correct suggestions for 'git push -u' commands.
