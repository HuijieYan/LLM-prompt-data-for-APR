The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flags and their arguments from the command. It is also not correctly extracting the `push_upstream` part from the stderr.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic for handling the removal of the flags and their arguments, as well as extracting the `push_upstream` correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # extract the push_upstream part from the stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().replace('To ', '')
    else:
        push_upstream = 'origin master'

    # replace the push argument with the extracted push_upstream
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version of the `get_new_command` function, it should pass the failing test.
