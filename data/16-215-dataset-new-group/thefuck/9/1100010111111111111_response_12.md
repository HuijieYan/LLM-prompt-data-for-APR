The bug in the code is causing an IndexError when trying to pop elements out of the `command.script_parts` list. This is occurring because the `upstream_option_index` is being incorrectly set for the '-u' option and is not being checked for the existence of the index before trying to pop the element.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Check if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before trying to pop the elements.
2. Use `upstream_option_index` to remove the elements only if it is not -1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check for the existence of the index
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
