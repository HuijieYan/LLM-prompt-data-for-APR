The buggy function is designed to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command's script parts. It then retrieves the suggested git push command from the stderr and replaces the "push" argument with the retrieved suggestion.

The main issue is that the index of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is being used to remove both the option and its argument from the command's script parts. This behavior is incorrect and causing the bug. 

To fix the bug, we need to make sure to remove both the option and its argument when either "--set-upstream" or "-u" is present in the command's script parts.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the --set-upstream option
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('origin')  # Get the index of the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the -u option
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('origin')  # Get the index of the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command's script parts, and then generate the suggestion for the new command based on the retrieved git push suggestion.
