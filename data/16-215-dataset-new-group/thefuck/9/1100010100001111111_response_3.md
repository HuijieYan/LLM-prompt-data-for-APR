The buggy function is trying to remove the --set-upstream or -u option from the command and its argument, and then concatenate the remaining arguments onto the command suggested by git.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for finding and removing the --set-upstream or -u option from the command.
2. The extraction of the suggested command from the stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the code is trying to use the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' directly from the command.script_parts, without considering the position where these options actually appear within the list.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Adjust the logic for finding and removing the --set-upstream or -u option from the command, considering the actual position of these options within the list.
2. Extract the suggested command from the stderr in a more robust way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    new_command = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in new_command:
        index = new_command.index('--set-upstream')
        new_command.pop(index)
        new_command.pop(index)  # Remove the option and its argument
    elif '-u' in new_command:
        index = new_command.index('-u')
        new_command.pop(index)
        new_command.pop(index)  # Remove the option and its argument

    push_command = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('    git push'):
            push_command = line.strip()
            break

    if push_command:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command), 'push', push_command)
    else:
        return None  # Handle this case according to the specific requirements

```

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue. It properly removes the --set-upstream or -u option from the command and its argument, and extracts the suggested command from the stderr in a more reliable manner.
