The issue in the buggy function is related to the handling of the --set-upstream or -u options. The function is currently not removing these options and their arguments when present, resulting in an incorrect concatenation of the command suggested by git.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly removing the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments from the command. This results in an incorrect concatenation of the command suggested by git, leading to an IndexError when trying to remove these elements from the list of script parts.

To fix the bug, we need to properly remove the --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments from the command. We can achieve this by first checking if the --set-upstream or -u options are present in the script parts, and then removing them along with their arguments if found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the removal of --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments, ensuring that the suggested command by git is concatenated correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in GitHub by addressing the incorrect suggestions for git push -u origin.
