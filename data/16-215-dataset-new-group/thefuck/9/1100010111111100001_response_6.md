The issue in the buggy function is that it does not remove both the "--set-upstream" and "-u" options and their arguments. It only removes one at a time, leading to the IndexError in the case where the buggy function tries to remove the second occurrence of the option.

To fix this bug, we can first identify and remove both occurrences of "--set-upstream" and "-u" along with their respective arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indexes = [i for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for index in upstream_option_indexes:
        if index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this change, the function should be able to handle the options and their arguments correctly, and it should pass the failing test cases.
