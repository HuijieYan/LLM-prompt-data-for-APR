The issue is that the `get_new_command` function is not properly handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `git push` command. As a result, the function is not correctly replacing the arguments in the command as expected, and the failing test cases are not passing.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. When trying to locate the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list, there is no check to ensure that the index exists before using it.
2. The logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command script is not correct.
3. The extraction of the `push_upstream` value from `command.stderr` is not accurate.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the removal and replacement of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. This results in incorrect output for the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function will need to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command script, and extract the proper `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` based on the actual output of the `git push` command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option and its argument
    
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option and its argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]  # Extract the last argument from the stderr
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, as well as properly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`. This should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
