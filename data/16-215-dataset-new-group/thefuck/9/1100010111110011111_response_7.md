The buggy function `get_new_command` tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if passed in the command. It then extracts the suggested git command from the error message and replaces the `push` command with it.

The bug occurs when attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The buggy function also incorrectly extracts the suggested git command from the error message, resulting in an incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the code for extracting the suggested git command from the error message is not correct.

To fix the bug, we need to properly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. Then we should correctly extract the suggested git command from the error message and replace the `push` command with it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-3:]
    return "git " + " ".join(push_upstream)
```
With this corrected function, it should handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument properly and extract the suggested git command from the error message accurately. This should resolve the issue and pass all the failing test cases.
