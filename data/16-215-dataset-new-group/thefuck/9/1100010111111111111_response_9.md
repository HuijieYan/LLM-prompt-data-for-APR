The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to be related to the handling of the `upstream_option_index` and the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list. The bug causes an `IndexError` when attempting to pop elements from `command.script_parts`.

The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is being used to pop elements directly from the `command.script_parts` list without ensuring that the index is valid. This results in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we can adjust the logic to remove the specified elements from the `command.script_parts` list without directly using specific indices for popping.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This correction ensures that the elements are removed from the `command.script_parts` list without directly using specific indices that could lead to an `IndexError`. 
Furthermore, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case scenarios and satisfy the expected input/output values.
