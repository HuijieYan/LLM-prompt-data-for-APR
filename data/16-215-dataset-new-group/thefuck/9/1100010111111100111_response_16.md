The main issue in the buggy function `get_new_command` is that it incorrectly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from the `git push` command. The function also incorrectly retrieves the command output to determine the new command to be returned.

The incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments causes the `IndexError` as observed in the failing test's error message.

Additionally, the function should not rely on parsing the command's stderr to determine the new command. Instead, it should construct the new command based on the given script parts and the branch name.

To fix the bug, the handling of the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments needs to be corrected, and the function should construct the new command based on the script parts and the branch name.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in script_parts:
        script_parts.remove('-u')
    
    # Construct the new command based on the script parts and the branch name
    push_branch = script_parts[-1] if script_parts else 'master'
    return 'git push --set-upstream origin ' + push_branch
```

This corrected version handles the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and constructs the new command without relying on the command's stderr. The new command is constructed based on the script parts and the branch name, providing the expected behavior.
