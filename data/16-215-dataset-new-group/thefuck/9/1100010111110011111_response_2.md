The buggy function `get_new_command` is causing an error due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list. This is likely because it doesn't account for cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the cases where `-u` or `--set-upstream` are not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated version of the function checks if `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts` list using `if` statements, and then removes it if found. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to the bug.
