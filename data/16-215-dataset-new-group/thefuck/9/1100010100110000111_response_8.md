The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop an item from an empty list. This is happening because the `upstream_option_index` is being set to -1 and is not being checked before attempting to pop items from the `command.script_parts` list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to pop items from the list. We also need to update the logic for finding the index of `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fixed version, the function should no longer produce an IndexError and should pass the failing test provided in the error message. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub as well.
