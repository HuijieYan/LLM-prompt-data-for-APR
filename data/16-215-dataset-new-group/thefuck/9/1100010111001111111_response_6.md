Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it's clear that the issue lies in the logic for handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option in the `git push` command. The function is not correctly identifying and handling these options, leading to incorrect output results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for identifying and handling the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option. We should be checking for both options and their respective positions in the command. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct `push_upstream` value is obtained from the stderr of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and produce the expected output for the failing test cases. The fix satisfies the expected input/output values and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
