The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an IndexError when trying to remove the '-u' option from the command. This is due to the fact that it is trying to pop the same index twice from the `command.script_parts` list, which results in an IndexError as the list becomes empty after the first pop operation.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the '-u' option exists in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove it. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function will first check if the '--set-upstream' option or the '-u' option exists in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove it. This will resolve the IndexError and make the function work correctly.
