The bug in the original function is caused by the `pop()` operation being performed twice on the same index, which results in an "IndexError: pop index out of range" when the index is out of range. 

To fix the bug, the conditions and operations related to popping the elements from the `command.script_parts` list need to be adjusted. The condition to check for the presence of the index `-1` needs to be changed to `!= -1`, and an additional condition should be added to ensure the index is within the range before performing the second pop operation.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue.
