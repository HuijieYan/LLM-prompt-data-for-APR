The bug in the buggy function occurs when the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options are included in the command's script parts. When these options are present, the function removes them and their arguments from the script parts but fails to update the push_upstream variable accordingly. This leads to incorrect suggestions for the new command.

To fix the bug, the function needs to update the push_upstream variable to reflect the changes made to the command's script parts.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        push_upstream = 'push ' + ' '.join(command.script_parts[1:])  # Update push_upstream with the correct value
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the push_upstream variable reflects the changes made to the command's script parts when removing the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options.
