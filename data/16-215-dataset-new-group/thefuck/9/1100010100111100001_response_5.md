The bug causes the function to sometimes access the index of `upstream_option_index`, which may not exist if `-u` is not in `command.script_parts`. This results in the `IndexError: pop index out of range`. 

To fix this bug, you can update the code to properly check for both the options `--set-upstream` and `-u`, and then remove it along with its argument from the `command.script_parts`. If either of these options exists, you can then get the push upstream from the stderr, split it, and return the command with "push" replaced by the upstream.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u is passed, remove it and its argument and replace it with information from stderr
    command_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        del command_parts[upstream_index:upstream_index + 2]
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        upstream_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        del command_parts[upstream_index:upstream_index + 2]
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split(' ')[-1]
    command_parts.append(push_upstream)
    
    return " ".join(command_parts)
```
