## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > (upstream_option_index + 1):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The key issue in the existing function is that it does not properly handle the case where the '-u' option does not exist in the `command.script_parts`. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the elements from the list. 

The corrected version of the function checks if `upstream_option_index` is still -1 after the first attempt to find '--set-upstream', and only then attempts to find '-u'. Additionally, it checks if there are more elements in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to pop them.

By addressing these issues, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values.
