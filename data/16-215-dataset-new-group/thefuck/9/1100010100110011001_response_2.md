The buggy function is intended to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and replacing it with the argument obtained from the command's stderr. The error message indicates that an IndexError occurs when trying to remove the elements at the index stored in `upstream_option_index` from the `command.script_parts` list.

The cause of the bug is that after the first option `--set-upstream` is removed, the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` does not account for the fact that the list has been modified, causing the IndexError.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to update the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` based on the fact that the list length has changed after the first pop operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # check if the list length has changed
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
