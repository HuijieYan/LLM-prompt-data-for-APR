The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list at an incorrect index. This index is derived from the `upstream_option_index`, which is modified to an incorrect value when multiple flags are present, resulting in the wrong element getting popped. 

A strategy for fixing this bug is to first correctly determine the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and then use this index to remove the corresponding flags and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_flag_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_flag_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_flag_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_flag_index != -1:
        command.script_parts = [part for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts) if i != upstream_flag_index and i != upstream_flag_index + 1]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass with the corrected function.
