The cause of the bug is an IndexError that occurs when using the pop() method to remove an item from a list that doesn't exist in the list. Specifically, the error is happening at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` where the index `upstream_option_index` might not exist in the `command.script_parts` list.

To fix this bug, we should revise the logic to check whether the elements exist in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        if upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected version should no longer raise an IndexError and pass the failing test.
