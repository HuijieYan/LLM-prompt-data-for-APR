## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument from the command and its argument, and then construct a new command with the remaining parts. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its manipulation. It also seems to be related to the extraction of the `push_upstream` part from the `command.stderr`.

The bug is causing the function not to correctly construct the new command as expected.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function fails to handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument properly, and it also fails to correctly extract the `push_upstream` part from the `command.stderr`. This results in an incorrect new command being constructed.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its argument from the command.
2. Extract the correct `push_upstream` part from the `command.stderr`.
3. Construct the new command using the remaining parts of the original command and the extracted `push_upstream` part.

## Corrected Function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the flag

    if '-u' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument
        command_parts.pop(index)  # remove the flag

    push_upstream = command.stderr.strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
