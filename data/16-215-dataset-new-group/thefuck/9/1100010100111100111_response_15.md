The bug in the `git_push.py` file is causing an `IndexError` when trying to remove the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. This is because the buggy function is trying to pop the same index twice, resulting in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for removing the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. We also need to correctly handle the case when the option is not found in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            return None  # return None if neither option is found

    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # check if the option was found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # check if there's an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, we are using `try-except` blocks to handle the cases when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not found in the `command.script_parts`. If neither option is found, we return `None`. We also check if there's an argument to remove before calling `pop()` to avoid the `IndexError`.

This corrected version should fix the `IndexError` issue and pass the failing test. Additionally, it will resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
