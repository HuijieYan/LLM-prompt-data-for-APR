## The corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # pop again for the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The issue with the original function is that after finding the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u', it doesn't properly remove both the option and its argument from the command.script_parts list. This is because the second call to `pop` will remove the wrong element if the first call to `pop` rearranges the list.

To fix this, the corrected function first removes the option and its argument if it's found, then returns the new command with the correct argument replaced.
