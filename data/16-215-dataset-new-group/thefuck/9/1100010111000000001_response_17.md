The issue with the current `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command, and it's not properly replacing the branch name with the suggested branch name from the git command output.

The cause of the bug is that when removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`, the function is not correctly adjusting the index before removing the next element. This leads to incorrect removal of elements from the list.

To fix the bug, we should first handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command by correctly adjusting the index and then replace the branch name with the suggested branch name from the git command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the `get_new_command` function should properly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and replace the branch name with the suggested branch name from the git command output. This should then pass the failing test.
