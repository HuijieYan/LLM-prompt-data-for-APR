The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it is designed to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" argument from the command and its argument and concatenate the remaining arguments onto the command suggested by git. The error message indicates that there is an IndexError in the `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line.

The cause of the bug is that when both "--set-upstream" and "-u" are not in the `command.script_parts` list, the `upstream_option_index` remains as the default value of -1. As a result, the subsequent pop operation tries to pop a negative index, leading to the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we can check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before performing the pop operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if upstream_option_index is not -1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case when neither "--set-upstream" nor "-u" are found in the command, and pass the failing test.
