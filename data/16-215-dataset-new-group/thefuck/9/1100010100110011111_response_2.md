## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            if upstream_option_index != -1:
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By reviewing the error message and the failing test, it is evident that the bug is caused by incorrect handling of the '-u' option. The original code does not correctly check if the '-u' option is present and tries to remove it without checking its existence. This results in an IndexError when the '-u' option is not present.

The corrected version of the function addresses this issue by changing the logic to properly check for the presence of the '-u' option before attempting to remove it. Additionally, it includes an `else` block to handle the case where '--set-upstream' has been checked and not found, and then it checks for '-u'.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output for all relevant cases.
