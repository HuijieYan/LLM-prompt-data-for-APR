The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the handling of the `upstream_option_index` when the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option is not found in the `command.script_parts`. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the list `command.script_parts`.

The fix for this bug involves checking the index of `-u` and `--set-upstream` separately, and also handling the case when either of them is not found. Additionally, the `push_upstream` is extracted from the `command.stderr` using relevant parsing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
