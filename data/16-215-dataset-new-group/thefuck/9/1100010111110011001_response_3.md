The bug in the given code is that the `pop()` method is being called twice on the `command.script_parts` list, which causes an IndexError. The intention of the original code is to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. However, removing an element from the list causes the indices of subsequent elements to change, and when `pop()` is called a second time regardless of whether the first attempt was successful, it can lead to an IndexError.

To fix the bug, the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line should be replaced with `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)` so that it removes the correct element from the list.

Additionally, the logic for detecting whether `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the command needs to be revised. The existing logic seems to be faulty and does not properly handle both scenarios.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output values and types for all provided test cases.
