## Fixing the bug

The bug in the code is caused by the incorrect indexing of the `command.script_parts` list and the incorrect assignment of the `push_upstream` variable. The function is also not handling the case when the `-u` option is present.

To fix the bug, we should first handle the case when the `-u` option is present and remove it from the `command.script_parts` list. Then, we should correctly extract the `push_upstream` string from the `command.stderr` based on the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. Lastly, we should use the extracted `push_upstream` string to replace the argument in the command and return the corrected command string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Handle the case when -u is present
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract push_upstream string
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for i in range(-1, -4, -1):  # Looking for the last occurrence in the last 3 lines
        if 'git ' in stderr_lines[i]:
            push_upstream = stderr_lines[i].split('git ')[1]
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
