The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly removes the upsteam option from the command and its argument. The function then tries to extract the push_upstream value from the stderr message, but it fails to extract the correct value. This leads to incorrect suggestions for the git push command.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly identify the upstream option and its argument, then extract the push_upstream value from the stderr message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
    else:
        upstream_option = '-u'
        if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]  # Extract the correct push_upstream value
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function correctly removes the upstream option and its argument from the command script_parts. It then properly extracts the push_upstream value from the stderr message. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
