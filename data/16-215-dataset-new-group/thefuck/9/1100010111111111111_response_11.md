The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to incorrect manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to remove elements that do not exist. This issue is causing the failing test cases to not produce the expected output.

To fix this bug, the strategy is to first check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove it. If the option is present, then it can be safely removed along with its argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the `get_new_command` function should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
