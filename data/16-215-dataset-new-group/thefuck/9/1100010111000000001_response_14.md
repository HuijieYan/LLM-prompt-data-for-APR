The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The code that tries to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the script_parts of the command.
2. The code that removes the '--set-upstream' and '-u' from the script_parts of the command.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not handling the cases where '--set-upstream' or '-u' might not be present in the command.script_parts. This can cause index errors and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if '--set-upstream' or '-u' is present in the command.script_parts before trying to remove them. Additionally, we need to extract the 'origin master' part correctly from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the cases where '--set-upstream' or '-u' may not be present in the command, and it correctly extracts the 'origin master' part from the stderr.
