The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly removes the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command script, which is causing the failing tests.

The buggy function has a try-except block to find the index of the `--set-upstream` option, and then a separate try-except block to find the index of the `-u` option. The bug is that if the `--set-upstream` option is found, it correctly removes it from the `command.script_parts` list, but then it also tries to remove the next element in the list, which was originally the argument to `--set-upstream` but is now an unrelated part of the command script.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use a single try-except block to find and remove either the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return command.script

    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument to the option
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option itself

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the `get_new_command` function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected values for the given input parameters.
