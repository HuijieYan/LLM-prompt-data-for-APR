Based on the description of the bug and the failing test cases, it appears that the code is not correctly handling the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, leading to an IndexError when attempting to pop from the script_parts list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is as follows:
1. When the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is found, remove it and its argument from the script_parts list.
2. Use the correct index for the pop operation to avoid the IndexError.
3. Extract the push_upstream value from the stderr as done in the original code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument, and provide the expected output for the failing test cases.
