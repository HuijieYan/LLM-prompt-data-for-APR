The buggy function `get_new_command` has a few potential error locations:
1. The `upstream_option_index` is initially set to -1, so the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1:` will always be true. This should be changed to `if upstream_option_index != -1:`
2. The `pop` method is used twice on `command.script_parts` without checking if the index is out of range, which could potentially cause an `IndexError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. This leads to incorrect generation of the new command.

To fix the bug, we need to properly remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and their arguments, and then construct the new command with the corrected script parts.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now properly remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and their arguments and construct the new command accordingly.
