The buggy function is meant to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their corresponding arguments from the `git push` command and replace the `push` argument with the correct value extracted from the `stderr`.

The bug occurs because when the `-u` option is present in the `git push` command, the `upstream_option_index` is incorrectly set to `2`, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to remove the option and its argument. This happens because the `upstream_option_index` is not being correctly updated after the first attempt.

To fix this bug, we will need to properly handle the cases where both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are present in the command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This fixed version of the function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output for all cases.
