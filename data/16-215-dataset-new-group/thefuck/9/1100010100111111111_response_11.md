The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop the elements from the list that don't exist.

To fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `command.script_parts` list and remove them accordingly. Then we can extract the value we need from `command.stderr` and use it to construct the new command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index + 2]
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index + 2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
