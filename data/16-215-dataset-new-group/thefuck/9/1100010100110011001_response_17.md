The bug in the given function is causing an IndexError when trying to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

The bug is occurring because when the function tries to remove elements from `command.script_parts` using the `pop` method, it is not checking if the index is within the bounds of the list. This leads to an IndexError when the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `upstream_option_index` is a valid index before trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
