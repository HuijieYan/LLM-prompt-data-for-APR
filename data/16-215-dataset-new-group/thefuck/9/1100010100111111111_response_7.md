The bug in the function `get_new_command` is causing an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when the command includes the `-u` option. This error occurs because the function is attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list using the value of `upstream_option_index`, which may be out of range if the `-u` option is not found in the list.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the index of the `-u` option is found, and then remove it from the list. Then we can proceed to get the `push_upstream` value, which is extracted from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should handle the cases where the `-u` option is included in the command and avoid the IndexError. It should also provide the correct new command based on the stderr message.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test case.
