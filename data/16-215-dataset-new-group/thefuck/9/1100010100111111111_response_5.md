The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by the incorrect popping of elements from `command.script_parts`. This is resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element that is out of range.

The strategy to fix the bug is to properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts` list, and then extract the correct value for `push_upstream` from the `command.stderr` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument if present
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)

    # Extract push_upstream from command.stderr
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = error_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command string correctly and extract the `push_upstream` value accurately from the `command.stderr`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to this bug.
