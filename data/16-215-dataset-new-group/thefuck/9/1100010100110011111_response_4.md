## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:  # Change is here, using >= instead of !=
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Since we already removed an element from the list, for the next pop we should use the same index
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Explanation:
- The bug occurred because when the index of a command was not found, the `upstream_option_index` was being set to -1, and then the next `try` block was overwriting this value. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` also did not work correctly, as it should have checked if the index was greater than or equal to 0.
- To fix the bug, I changed the check from `if upstream_option_index is not -1` to `if upstream_option_index >= 0`.
- I also corrected the second pop operation to use the same index as the first pop operation, since the list is being modified and the indices have shifted.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the GitHub issue #538 related to this bug.
