The buggy function `get_new_command` fails to handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts`, which leads to an IndexError when trying to access the `push_upstream` value.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts` list, which leads to the `push_upstream` being assigned an incorrect value, resulting in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before trying to access the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`. Additionally, we need to handle the case when `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not present in the `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = "origin master"
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('To '):
            push_upstream = line.split(' ')[1].strip()
            break

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass.
