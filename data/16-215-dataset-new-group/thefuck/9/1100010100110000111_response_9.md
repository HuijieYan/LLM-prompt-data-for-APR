The bug in the function `get_new_command` is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list based on the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command. This error is triggered when the command does not contain these options and the index is not found in the `command.script_parts` list.

The bug is causing the function to fail when trying to manipulate the command to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected result described in the GitHub issues.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the index is not found in the `command.script_parts` list for both `--set-upstream` and `-u`. We need to check if the index is found before removing the elements from the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function checks for the presence of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options before trying to remove them. It uses `try-except` blocks to handle the case when the index is not found in the `command.script_parts` list and thus prevents the `IndexError` from occurring. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problems and make the function work as intended.
