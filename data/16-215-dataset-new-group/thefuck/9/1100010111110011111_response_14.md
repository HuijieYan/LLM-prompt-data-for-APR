To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The function is not correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts`.
2. The function is not correctly extracting the `git` command and its arguments from the `command.stderr`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the index removal properly and is not accurately extracting the `git` command and its arguments from the `command.stderr`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` and improve the extraction of the `git` command and its arguments from the `command.stderr`.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index + 1]:
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, the `for` loop is used to iterate through both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options. For each option found, it removes the option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the `git` command and its arguments from `command.stderr` is modified to ensure the correct index is used to extract the desired value.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issues reported on GitHub.
