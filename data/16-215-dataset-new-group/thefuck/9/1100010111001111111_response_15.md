Based on the analysis of the buggy function, failing test, runtime input/output variable values, expected input/output variable values, and GitHub Issue information, it appears that the issue stems from the buggy function's logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The function is not handling these cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Adjust the logic to properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts`.
2. Ensure that the `push_upstream` value is extracted correctly from the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments correctly, and extract the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
