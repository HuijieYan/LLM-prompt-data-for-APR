To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' needs to be properly handled when both are present in the `command.script_parts`.
2. The `pop` method to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option should be modified to handle the index properly and remove the appropriate elements.

The cause of the bug is that when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present, the second `pop` operation is trying to remove an element from an index that no longer exists in the modified list.

To fix the bug, we should use the `remove` method to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we should also handle the case when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present, and only one of them should be removed.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and handle the input/output values correctly.
