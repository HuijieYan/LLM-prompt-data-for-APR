The bug in the function `get_new_command` is causing an IndexError when trying to pop the `upstream_option_index` from `command.script_parts`. This is happening because the `upstream_option_index` is not getting the correct value. 

The cause of the bug is that when trying to find the index of `'-u'` in `command.script_parts`, it is not being considered that if `--set-upstream` is already found, then the index of `'-u'` should not be overwritten.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to find the index of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` and use the correct index when removing the corresponding elements from `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `get_new_command`:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Need to pop again here, as the second pop would be at the new index after removing the previous element.
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This correction introduces an additional condition to check which flag ('--set-upstream' or '-u') is present. Then, the correct index is used to remove the elements from `command.script_parts`, which should resolve the IndexError.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
