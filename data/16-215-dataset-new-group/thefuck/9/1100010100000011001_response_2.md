## Buggy Function Explanation
The buggy function is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command, and then extract the command suggested by git from the stderr and replace the arguments with it.

The bug in this function is that when the `-u` option is found, it removes it from the `command.script_parts`, but it does not remove its argument, resulting in an incorrect command.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the argument of the `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list when the `-u` option is found.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove '-u'
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the `-u` option separately to ensure that both the option and its argument are removed from `command.script_parts` when the `-u` option is present. This should fix the bug and produce the expected output.
