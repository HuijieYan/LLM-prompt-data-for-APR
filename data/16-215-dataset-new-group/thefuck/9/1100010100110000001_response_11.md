The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is supposed to modify a git push command and return a modified version of it. The error message is "IndexError: pop index out of range", and it occurs when the command does not contain --set-upstream or -u.

The bug occurs because if the "--set-upstream" flag is not present in the command, the value of `upstream_option_index` remains -1. When it tries to pop the upstream_option_index, it generates an IndexError since -1 is out of range of the list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` which occurs twice and instead modify the if condition to check if `upstream_option_index` is greater than -1 before popping the value from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Corrected
    else:
        return command.script  # Return original command if --set-upstream or -u are not found

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
