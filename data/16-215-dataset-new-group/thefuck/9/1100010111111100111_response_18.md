The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command. The issue is caused by the incorrect removal of the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the faulty removal of the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list needs to be addressed. The corrected version of the function should handle the removal of the option and its argument more accurately.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    option_index = -1
    try:
        option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > option_index:  # check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list without causing an `IndexError`.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test cases pass successfully. Additionally, it addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u myfork` commands.
