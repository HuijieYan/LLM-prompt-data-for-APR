The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` when the command includes the `-u` option. This is because the script tries to pop the same array index twice, but the second time it's out of range since it was already removed.

To fix this bug, we can update the code so that the index is removed only once, and then exit the function if it's not found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This version will handle both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly, and it should fix the `IndexError` issue.
