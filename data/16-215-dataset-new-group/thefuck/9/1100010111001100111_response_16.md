The buggy function aims to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the git push command and replace it with the suggested upstream branch. However, the bug occurs because the function incorrectly calculates the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command, leading to incorrect replacements.

The main issue is with the calculation of the 'upstream_option_index' variable, which is the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command. The buggy function only checks for the presence of one option at a time, and if the first option is not found, it directly moves to the second option without considering its position in the command.

To fix the bug, the function should check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and then update the index accordingly. Additionally, when removing the option and its argument, the function should re-calculate the index based on the updated command parts.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option's argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By adding proper condition checks for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and re-calculating the index after removing the options and their arguments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
