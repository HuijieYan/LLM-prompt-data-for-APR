To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to address the IndexError that occurs when trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case when `-u` is used in the `git push` command. The function is trying to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the command script parts, but it is not considering that both options might not be present in the list.

To fix the bug, we can check if the options are present in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove them, and we need to properly set the `upstream_option_index` based on the presence of each option.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop again to remove the argument
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
In this corrected version, we check for the presence of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options in the `command.script_parts` list. If either is present, we update `upstream_option_index` accordingly and then remove the options and their arguments. This approach ensures that the function handles both cases correctly.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the GitHub issue related to fixing suggestions for `git push -u` commands.
