The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to remove an element from the `command.script_parts` list that does not exist.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking if the `-u` option is present before trying to remove it from the list of `command.script_parts`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for detecting and removing the `-u` option from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the `stderr` does not contain the expected information.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.stderr.split('\n')) >= 3:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    
    # If the expected details from stderr are not present, return the original command
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected version of the function checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts` and removes them if present. It also validates the `stderr` output to ensure it contains the necessary information before proceeding. If the necessary details are not present in `stderr`, it returns the original command.
