The cause of the bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it incorrectly handles the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `git push` command. It tries to remove these options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts`, but it does so incorrectly. Additionally, it retrieves the suggested git push command from `command.stderr` in an unreliable way, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. It should also properly parse the suggested git push command from the stderr of the command.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original list

    # Remove --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments
    for opt in ('--set-upstream', '-u'):
        if opt in script_parts:
            opt_index = script_parts.index(opt)
            del script_parts[opt_index: opt_index + 2]

    # Extract the suggested git push command from command.stderr
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = next((line.partition('git ')[2].strip() for line in reversed(error_lines) if line.startswith('    git push')), '')

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In this corrected version, the `command.script_parts` list is copied and modified to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. The suggested git push command is extracted from `command.stderr` in a more reliable way by searching for the line that starts with "    git push".

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
