## Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `get_new_command` is a part of the `git_push.py` file in the `thefuck` repository. The function is responsible for processing the command and generating a new command based on the error message received. The GitHub issue #538 broke the suggestions for `git push -u myfork` and reported that the suggestion should be `git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp` instead of `hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier`.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Handling of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options.
2. Parsing the error message to extract the correct push upstream suggestion.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and it is not parsing the error message to extract the correct push upstream suggestion. This results in the incorrect replacement of the command.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options by removing them and their arguments from the command.
2. Parse the error message to extract the correct push upstream suggestion.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option = None
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option = '-u'
    
    if upstream_option:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We properly handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options by checking if they are present in the command and then removing them and their arguments if found.
2. We parse the error message to extract the correct push upstream suggestion.
