The buggy function `get_new_command` is failing and causing an IndexError during invocation due to an error in the logic of removing `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command script. The error message and the failing test both indicate that the issue is related to the removal of options from the `command.script_parts`.

The bug is occurring at this line:
```python
command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
Here, the buggy function tries to remove `upstream_option_index` from `command.script_parts` and then tries to remove it again in the next line without checking if it has already been removed.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the index is checked if it is not out of range before attempting to remove it from the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
In the corrected version, the code first tries to find the index of `--set-upstream` and removes it if found. Then it checks for the index of `-u` and removes it if found. These actions are only performed if the index is valid, and it ensures that an index out of range error is not raised.
