The bug in the provided buggy function is causing the failing tests due to the incorrect pop of the command.script_parts list. The error message in the failing test suggests that the index out of range error is occurring at the line where the pop operation is executed. This indicates that the script_parts list is being accessed incorrectly, causing the pop operation to attempt to remove an element at an index that is out of range.

To fix this bug, the pop operation should only be called once inside the if statement, to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command script_parts.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the corresponding argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and return the expected values and types of variables.
