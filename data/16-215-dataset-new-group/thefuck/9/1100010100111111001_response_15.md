The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` because it is trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list beyond its length. This occurs when the `-u` flag is present in the `command.script_parts`, as it tries to remove both `-u` and its argument, but only pops the index of `-u`.

To fix this issue, we need to properly handle the removal of the `-u` flag and its argument and ensure that we are not popping elements that do not exist in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            # Check if there is an argument following the -u flag, then pop it
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except (ValueError, IndexError):
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags and their arguments. It also includes additional checks to ensure no IndexErrors occur when trying to pop elements from the list. This new version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
