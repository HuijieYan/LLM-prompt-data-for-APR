The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The function is trying to remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the command, but it does not handle the case when both options are present in the command, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to remove the second occurrence.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After removing --set-upstream, the next element is its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test case should pass, and the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
