The cause of the bug is that in the `if upstream_option_index is not -1` check, the subsequent `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is removing the element at index `upstream_option_index` twice, which is not necessary and results in an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the `if` statement to check if `upstream_option_index` is within the bounds of the list before removing the element at that index.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function should pass the given failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
