The buggy function fails to handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the command. The logic to remove these options and their arguments is incorrect and may lead to removing incorrect parts of the command.

The buggy function `get_new_command` should be fixed to correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command. It should then extract the suggested push command from the `stderr` and replace the arguments of the original command with the extracted push command.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    new_command = command.script_parts[:]
    
    if '--set-upstream' in new_command:
        index = new_command.index('--set-upstream')
        new_command.pop(index)  # remove --set-upstream
        new_command.pop(index)  # remove its argument
    elif '-u' in new_command:
        index = new_command.index('-u')
        new_command.pop(index)  # remove -u
        new_command.pop(index)  # remove its argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(new_command), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function above should correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the command and then replace the correct arguments with the extracted push command.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass and the issue posted on GitHub should also be resolved.
