The bug in the `get_new_command` function is due to the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. This results in the `IndexError` when trying to pop an index that is out of range. Additionally, the `push_upstream` variable is not being correctly calculated because the method used to extract it is not robust enough.

To fix the bug, we need to:
- Check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts` before trying to extract its index
- Update the logic to correctly extract the `push_upstream` string from the `command.stderr`

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u is in command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    # Extract the push_upstream string from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1:]  # Extract the last word after 'git'
    push_upstream.insert(0, 'git')  # Add 'git' to the beginning
    push_upstream = " ".join(push_upstream)  # Join the parts to form the push_upstream string

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version includes the necessary checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` and updates the logic to correctly extract the `push_upstream` string from the `command.stderr`. This version should pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
