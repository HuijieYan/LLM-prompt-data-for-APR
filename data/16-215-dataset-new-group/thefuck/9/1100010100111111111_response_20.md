The bug in the get_new_command function is caused by incorrect handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option. The function improperly tries to remove the option and its argument from the command, but it does so incorrectly, leading to IndexError when the argument is not found.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument, and then extract the push command suggested by git from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function properly removes the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command if they are present. Then, it extracts the git push command suggested by git from the stderr and returns the correctly formatted new command.

This fix should resolve the IndexError issue and ensure that the get_new_command function works as intended, passing the failing test case and satisfying the expected input/output values.
