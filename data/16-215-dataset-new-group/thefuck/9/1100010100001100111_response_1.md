The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is not being handled correctly. The function is not removing the correct index when these options are present in the `command.script_parts`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to remove the `upstream_option_index` twice, once for `--set-upstream` and once for `-u`, without checking if the option is already removed. This results in an incorrect removal of indices and an incorrect command being formed.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the function to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. We also need to handle the case when the option is not present in the command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        # Check if there's an argument for -u and remove it if present
        if len(command.script_parts) > index:
            command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, and form the correct command based on the `push_upstream` value.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the bug in the `get_new_command` function.
