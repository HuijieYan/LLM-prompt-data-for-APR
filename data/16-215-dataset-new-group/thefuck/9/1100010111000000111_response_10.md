The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command. This results in incorrect output when the get_new_command function is called.

The "get_new_command" function needs to:
- Properly remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command.
- Extract the correct push upstream branch from the stderr message.
- Replace the argument with the correct push upstream branch in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(index)
        command_parts.pop(index)
    if '-u' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(index)
        command_parts.pop(index)
    
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].split()[-1]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, it should properly handle the removal of the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument, as well as extract the correct push upstream branch from the stderr message.

This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and the failing test case.
