The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of the `upstream_option_index` which is being reset and always ending up as `-1`. Additionally, for cases where the `upstream_option_index` is relevant, it appears that the pop operation on `command.script_parts` is incorrect and removes the wrong items, causing the resulting command to include extra options.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to correctly identify the indexes for '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the `command.script_parts`, and then adjust accordingly to remove the right items from `command.script_parts` and retrive the correct `push_upstream` value.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        # Make sure upstream_option_index is within the bounds of the list
        if upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, the presence of '--set-upstream' and '-u' is checked independently. Additionally, when removing the options and their arguments from `command.script_parts`, it makes sure that the index is within the bounds of the list. This ensures that incorrect items are not removed, resulting in an accurate `push_upstream` value.
