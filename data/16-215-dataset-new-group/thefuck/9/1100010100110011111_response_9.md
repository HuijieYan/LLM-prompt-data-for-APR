The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command and then extract the suggested push command from the error message. The failure is due to an `IndexError` when trying to pop an item from an empty list.

The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` variable is being assigned the value `-1` as a default, and when the `-u` option is present, it is not being updated to its index. This causes the subsequent `pop` operations to fail.

To fix the bug, the `upstream_option_index` should be set to the index of the option if it is found, and then the `pop` operations should only be performed if the index is not `-1`.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test by removing the `-u` option from the command and extracting the correct push command from the error message.
