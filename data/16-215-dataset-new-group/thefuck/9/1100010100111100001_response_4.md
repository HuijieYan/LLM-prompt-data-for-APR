The bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent pop operations on the `command.script_parts`. When the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' is found, it should only be removed once, along with the argument that follows it, which means the current implementation might pop the same index twice. Additionally, the assumption that the relevant output is always in the -3 position of the stderr might not be true for all cases.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the condition for finding 'upstream_option_index' is properly evaluated so that it only removes the option and its argument once, and that the correct position of the required output is determined dynamically based on the stderr content.

The corrected version of the function should look like this:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index+1:
            del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]

    for line in reversed(command.stderr.split('\n')):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream '):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

With these changes, the function will correctly handle the `upstream_option_index` and fetch the relevant output from the `stderr`. After implementing these corrections, all failing test cases should pass without any errors.
