## The source code of the buggy function

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

### Explanation
The buggy function seems to be attempting to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the input command. It then tries to extract the pushed upstream branch reference from the error message and construct a new command.

The cause of the bug is in the `if upstream_option_index is not -1` block, where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice. This causes an `IndexError` when the index is removed from the list in the first call and then the subsequent call tries to remove the same index which is now out of range.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to first correctly handle the finding and removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. Once that is done, we should ensure that the extraction of the pushed upstream branch reference from the error message is accurate and the new command is constructed correctly.

### The corrected version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove both the option and its argument
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove both the option and its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
