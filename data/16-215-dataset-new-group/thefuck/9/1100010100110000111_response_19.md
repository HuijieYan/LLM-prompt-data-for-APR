The bug in the provided code is causing an `IndexError` because when the `-u` option is present, the function tries to remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, but the problem is that `pop` is used twice even when there is just one `-u` option present, causing the index to be out of range.

To fix this bug, we can use the `remove` method on `command.script_parts` instead of attempting to pop specific indexes. This method will remove the first occurrence of the argument without causing an `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the function will remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument if it appears in the command. This corrected version should resolve the `IndexError` and pass the failing test.
