## The analysis and potential error locations

The buggy function is intended to remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument from the command and then replace the 'push' argument with the push_upstream value. The potential error locations are:
1. The handling of the upstream_option_index variable and its manipulation.
2. Retrieving the push_upstream from the command.stderr.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of finding the index of --set-upstream or -u in the command.script_parts list, as well as the incorrect retrieval of push_upstream from the command.stderr. This results in a wrong replacement of the arguments in the command.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

We need to first correctly find and remove the --set-upstream or -u flag and its argument from the command, and then properly retrieve the push_upstream value from the command.stderr. Once these two steps are corrected, the replacement of the 'push' argument with the push_upstream should work as intended.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Retrieve the push_upstream value correctly
    push_upstream = command.stderr.strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we use conditional statements to check for the presence of --set-upstream or -u in the command.script_parts list. We also use the strip() method to correctly retrieve the push_upstream value from the command.stderr. These corrections should address the issues reported in the GitHub bug reports.
