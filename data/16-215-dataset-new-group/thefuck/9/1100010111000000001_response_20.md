The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its accompanying argument from the command. It then takes the last line of the `stderr` output, extracts the parameter after 'git' and appends it to the `git push` command.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The `try-except` blocks are used to locate the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument, but the subsequent code does not handle the case where the argument is not found properly.
2. The implementation of the logic to extract the parameter after 'git' from the `stderr` output and append it to the `git push` command is not robust and may not work as intended.

The main cause of the bug is that the function does not handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument is not found properly. Furthermore, the logic to extract the parameter after 'git' from the `stderr` is not reliable and may not produce the expected result.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument is not found correctly and to improve the logic to extract the parameter after 'git' from the `stderr`.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the --set-upstream or -u argument and its accompanying argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    for i, part in enumerate(script_parts):
        if part in ('--set-upstream', '-u') and i + 1 < len(script_parts):
            script_parts.pop(i)  # Remove the argument
            script_parts.pop(i)  # Remove the parameter

    # Extract the parameter after 'git' from the stderr
    git_parts = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split(' ')[1:] 
    push_upstream = ' '.join(git_parts)

    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the `script_parts` to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its accompanying argument. Then we extract the parameters after 'git' from the `stderr` in a more robust way and use it to build the new `git push` command.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
