        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')

The potential error locations in the buggy function include the following:
1. The `try` and `except` blocks do not handle the potential errors correctly. 
2. The condition `upstream_option_index is not -1` is not properly checking for the index value.
3. The function does not properly handle case where the argument is not found.

The cause of the bug in this function is that the current method of checking for the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' does not work correctly. The usage of `try` and `except` blocks for this purpose is not proper in this scenario. 

The bug can be fixed by using `if` and `elif` statements to check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list. Then, the index can be used to remove the argument and its value from `command.script_parts` list. This ensures that the function handles the case when the argument is not found.
