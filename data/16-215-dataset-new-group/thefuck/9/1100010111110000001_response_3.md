The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to manipulate commands into a new form if the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is satisfied. However, there are a few issues:

1. When `--set-upstream` or `-u` is not found in `command.script_parts`, the `upstream_option_index` maintains its default value of `-1`. In this case, the `if` statement allowing for the removal of the corresponding elements from `command.script_parts` is always executed, leading to possible index out of range errors.
2. The code assumes that the `stderr` always contains the expected information at the same line position, in turn leading to an `IndexError` if the desired string is not found at the anticipated position.

To fix these issues, the following needs to be done:
- Check if `upstream_option_index` is greater than -1 before attempting to remove the elements from `command.script_parts`.
- Use string operations on `stderr` to extract the required information to avoid relying on the line position.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = ''
    # Extract push upstream using regular expressions
    import re
    match = re.search(r'git push (--set-upstream|-u)? ?(\w+) ?(\w+)?', command.stderr)
    if match:
        groups = match.groups()
        push_upstream = groups[-2] if groups[-2] else 'origin'
        push_upstream += ' ' + (groups[-1] if groups[-1] else 'master')
        
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove("--set-upstream")
    if "-u" in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove("-u")

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should resolve the index out of range issue and compute the proper `push_upstream` value. This should enable the function to correctly process the input and pass the provided test case.
