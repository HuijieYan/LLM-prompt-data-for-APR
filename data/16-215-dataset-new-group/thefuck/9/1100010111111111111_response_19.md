Based on the analysis of the buggy function, failing test, error message, runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it can be concluded that the bug occurs because the `pop` method is being called twice on the `command.script_parts` list without checking if it's empty or if the index is out of range.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to check if the index retrieved for `--set-upstream` or `-u` is within the range of the `command.script_parts` list before calling the `pop` method. If the index is valid, then remove the corresponding element from the list.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) >= upstream_option_index + 2:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove twice with valid index

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the function includes error checking for the index retrieved for `--set-upstream` or `-u` to ensure it is within the range of the `command.script_parts` list before calling the `pop` method. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values, as well as fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
