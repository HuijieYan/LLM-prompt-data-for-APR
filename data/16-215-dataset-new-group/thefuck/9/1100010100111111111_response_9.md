The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found in the `command.script_parts` list, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the elements at those indices.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' is found before attempting to pop the elements at those indices.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # Check if there's a value to pop
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function checks if '--set-upstream' or '-u' is in `command.script_parts` before trying to get the index. It also checks if there's a value to pop after removing the elements at the found indices.

With these changes, the function should now handle cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` might not be present in the command script parts, and it should pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values.
