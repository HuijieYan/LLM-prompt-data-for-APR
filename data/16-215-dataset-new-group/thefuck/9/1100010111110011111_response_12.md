The cause of the bug is that the function `get_new_command` does not properly handle the case where the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are not present in the command. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if either of the options '--set-upstream' or '-u' exist in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to pop them. If they do not exist, we should not make any changes to the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return command.script

    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the test cases should pass without any errors. This fix also addresses the issue raised in GitHub regarding the incorrect suggestion for `git push -u` commands.
