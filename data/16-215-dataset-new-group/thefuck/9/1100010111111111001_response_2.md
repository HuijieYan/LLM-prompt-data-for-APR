Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the buggy function is failing to handle the 'pop' operations correctly, leading to an IndexError. The error message indicates that 'pop index out of range' occurred at line 27. This suggests that the buggy function is attempting to pop an element from an empty list, causing the IndexError.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the index to be removed exists in the list before attempting to pop it. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts): # check if the index still exists after the first pop
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version checks if the indices to be removed exist in the list before attempting to pop them, thus preventing the IndexError.

It should now satisfy all the failing test cases and produce the expected input/output values.
