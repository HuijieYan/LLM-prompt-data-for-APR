The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an IndexError when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list. This is because the function assumes that both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options will be present in the command, which is not always the case, as shown in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the options are present before attempting to pop them from the list. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the `stderr` does not contain the expected message for setting upstream.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        try:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except IndexError:
            pass

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None
```

With this corrected function, it should handle cases where the options are not present or when the stderr does not contain the expected message. This should resolve the IndexError and allow the function to provide the correct command for setting the upstream branch.
