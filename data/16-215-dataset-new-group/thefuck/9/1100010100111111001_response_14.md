### Explanation:
The buggy function is failing to handle the presence of the `-u` option in the `git push` command. When `-u` is present, it is stored at index 2 in the `command.script_parts` list, so removing it at index `upstream_option_index` would not work as expected in all scenarios.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the function should accurately handle the removal of the `-u` option when it is present. Also, the function should be updated to handle the case where neither `--set-upstream` nor `-u` options are present.

### The corrected version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] == '-u':
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
