The bug in the function is caused by incorrect removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command arguments. Additionally, the parsing of the 'push' command suggested by git is incorrect, leading to a wrong replacement of the 'push' command.

To fix the bug, we should first correctly remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command arguments. Then, we should properly extract the suggested 'push' command from the stderr and use it to replace the 'push' command in the original command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split('git ')[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we correctly check for the existence of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option in the command arguments and remove it along with its argument if present. Then, we extract the suggested 'push' command from the stderr and use it to replace the 'push' command in the original command. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
