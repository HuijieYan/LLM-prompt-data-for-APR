Based on the error message and the runtime values, it seems that the buggy function is failing to properly handle the '-u' option for the 'git push' command. The function is trying to remove the '-u' option and its argument, but it's causing an IndexError because the index is out of range in some situations.

The buggy function can be fixed by first checking if the '-u' option is present and then removing it along with its argument. Additionally, it should handle the 'git push' command without any options as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if no upstream option is found

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the '-u' or '--set-upstream' option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument of the option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the '-u' and '--set-upstream' options properly and return the expected new command for both cases. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub ticket.
