The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the git push command. Instead of removing it and replacing it with the correct upstream branch, it just removes the option and its argument without replacing it with the correct one.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the get_new_command function to properly handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the git push command and replace them with the correct upstream branch.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' option
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # Get the upstream branch from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option with the correct upstream branch
    if upstream_option_index > 0:
        command.script_parts[upstream_option_index] = push_upstream
    else:
        command.script_parts.extend(['--set-upstream', push_upstream])

    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options in the git push command and replace them with the correct upstream branch.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
