## Issues:
1. The function calculates the `upstream_option_index` incorrectly for the '-u' command option, as it is overwritten in the following `try` block after the `--set-upstream` option. This causes the wrong command to be generated when both options are present ('git push -u origin').
2. The `upstream_option_index` stores the index of the option, but when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present, the logic to remove both options is not present.
3. The script constructs a new command using only the first part of the original command parts without the options, which results in the '-u' option being removed but not --set-upstream. This leads to the output always being 'git push --set-upstream origin master'.

## Solution:
1. To fix this bug, we will replace the usage of the `upstream_option_index` with two separate variables, `set_upstream_index` and `u_option_index`, to correctly store the index of the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, respectively. Then we'll remove both options by the corresponding indexes.
2. We'll modify the logic to remove both option indexes when both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present.
3. Then we'll construct the new command using all the parts of the original command to correctly include the remaining options.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    set_upstream_index = -1
    u_option_index = -1
    
    try:
        set_upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        u_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if set_upstream_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(set_upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(set_upstream_index)

        if u_option_index < set_upstream_index:
            u_option_index = u_option_index - 1
        else:
            command.script_parts.pop(u_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
