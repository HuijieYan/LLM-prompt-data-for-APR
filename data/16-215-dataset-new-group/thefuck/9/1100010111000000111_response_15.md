The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly removing the --set-upstream or -u option from the git push command and its argument. This results in an incorrect new command being generated.

To fix the bug, we need to update the get_new_command function to correctly identify and remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and then use the correct git push command which includes --set-upstream and its argument.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    cmd_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in cmd_parts:
        upstream_option_index = cmd_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in cmd_parts:
        upstream_option_index = cmd_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        return

    cmd_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    cmd_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_cmd = replace_argument(" ".join(cmd_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    return new_cmd
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument and generate the correct new command.

The updated function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
