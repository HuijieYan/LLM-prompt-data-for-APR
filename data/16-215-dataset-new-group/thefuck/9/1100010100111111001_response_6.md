The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is set to -1 by default. Then, if the parameter `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts`, the variable `upstream_option_index` is updated to the index of `-u`. However, if `-u` is not found, the `upstream_option_index` is still -1 and the subsequent `pop()` method triggers an `IndexError` because the index is out of range. 

To fix the bug, we need to correctly update the `upstream_option_index` when the `-u` parameter is found, and add a condition to only `pop()` if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
