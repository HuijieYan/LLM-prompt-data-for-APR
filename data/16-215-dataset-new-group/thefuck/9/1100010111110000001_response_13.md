The cause of the bug is related to the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. The buggy function tries to remove the element at the `upstream_option_index` twice, which leads to an `IndexError` when the element is already removed in the first attempt.

To fix the bug, we should modify the buggy function to remove the element at `upstream_option_index` once and then fetch the `push_upstream` value from `stderr` using the correct index, which is `-3` to retrieve the "git push --set-upstream origin master" command output from the `stderr` string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test.
