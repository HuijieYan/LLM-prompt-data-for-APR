The bug in the `get_new_command` function occurs because the `upstream_option_index` variable is being set to -1, and the subsequent `pop` operations are not accounted for when the index is -1. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop from the list at index -1.

To fix this bug, we can check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before performing the `pop` operations. If it's not -1, then we can proceed with the `pop` operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to this bug.
