## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, I modified the logic to check if '--set-upstream' or '-u' are present in the command.script_parts, and then remove them and their arguments accordingly. Additionally, I fixed the condition to check if the upstream_option_index is not equal to -1. This will prevent the IndexError that was occurring in the original buggy function.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue.
