The buggy function has several issues:

1. The try-except block for finding the indices of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command script parts is not correctly implemented. The second try block overwrites the value of the `upstream_option_index`, causing it to always contain the index value of the '-u' argument, even if the '--set-upstream' is present.
2. The pop operation is used to remove two elements from `command.script_parts` incorrectly. It pops the element at `upstream_option_index` twice, which may not be the correct approach.

To fix these issues:
1. The `upstream_option_index` should be initialized to -1, and it should be set only if the respective option is present in the command script parts. Using `if` and `elif` instead of multiple tries can help fix this issue.
2. Once the correct index has been determined, the pop operation should remove elements from `command.script_parts` using the calculated index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
