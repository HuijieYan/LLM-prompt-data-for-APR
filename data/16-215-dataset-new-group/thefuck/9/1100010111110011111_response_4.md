## The cause of the bug

The buggy function is attempting to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then use the output of `git push` to replace the `push` command with the upstream branch. However, there are a few issues:

1. The index of `upstream_option_index` is not being calculated correctly, as it is always being set to the index of `-u` regardless of whether `--set-upstream` is present.

2. The `push_upstream` is being extracted from the `stderr` of the command, but it is not parsing the correct branch name to be used as the upstream branch.

3. There is an `IndexError` when trying to remove the elements from `command.script_parts` when `-u` is used without an argument.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug will involve the following steps:
- Correctly identify and remove `--set-upstream` or `-u` from the `command.script_parts`
- Parse the correct branch name to be used as the upstream branch from the `stderr`
- Handle the case where `-u` is used without an argument to avoid `IndexError`

## The corrected version

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
        else:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove only the option if no argument is provided

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].replace('use', '').strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With the corrected version, we are correctly identifying and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. We are also parsing the correct branch name to be used as the upstream branch from the `stderr`. Additionally, we handle the case where `-u` is used without an argument to avoid the `IndexError`. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
