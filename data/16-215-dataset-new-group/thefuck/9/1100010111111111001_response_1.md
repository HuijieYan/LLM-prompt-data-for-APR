The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the indexing of the `command.script_parts` list. This indexing is done without checking if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are actually present in the `command.script_parts` list, leading to an IndexError when trying to remove those options from the list. 

A better strategy for fixing the bug would be to first check if the options are present in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to get their index or remove them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u options are present in the command
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    # Remove --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments if present
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
