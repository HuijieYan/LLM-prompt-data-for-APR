### Explanation
The bug seems to be caused by the `pop()` method being called twice on `command.script_parts`, which can result in an `IndexError` when the list becomes empty after the first call to `pop()`. This happens when the `-u` option is present in the command, which makes the `upstream_option_index` value equal to 2, and then the second `pop()` results in an `IndexError`.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check the length of `command.script_parts` before attempting to remove elements using `pop()`. This will ensure that we only call `pop()` if there are items to remove from the list.

### The corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > (upstream_option_index + 1):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
