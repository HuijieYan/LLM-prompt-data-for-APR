```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Use "!=" instead of "is not"
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that the condition `upstream_option_index is not -1` is incorrect. It should be `upstream_option_index != -1`. Additionally, when removing the argument and the option, the index for the argument should be removed first before removing the option.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Change the condition from `is not -1` to `!= -1` and adjust the order of removing the option and its argument.
