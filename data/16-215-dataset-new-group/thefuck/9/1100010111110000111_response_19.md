The buggy function is `get_new_command`, and the issue seems to be caused by the attempt to remove the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options from the `git push` command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the removal of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that may not exist.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the removal of the options and ensure that the command is constructed correctly without causing an `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # If there's an element at the index, pop it
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the removal of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options without causing an `IndexError`, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and passing the failing test.
