The buggy function is `get_new_command` which is meant to modify a git command. The function seems to be trying to remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" options and their arguments from the given git command, and then use the resulting command to determine the push upstream.

The bug is due to the index error caused by trying to pop elements from the list, command.script_parts, based on the indices derived from the "upstream_option_index". This causes the function to break when the indices are out of range.

To fix the bug, I would suggest using a conditional statement to check if the indices are valid before popping the elements from the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index+1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version should handle the edge case where the indices are out of range by verifying their validity before popping elements from the list.
