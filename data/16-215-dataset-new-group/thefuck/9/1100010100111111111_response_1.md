The bug in the provided function is causing an IndexError due to popping elements from the `command.script_parts` list without checking if the elements exist. This is happening when the `-u` option is passed, which is causing the function to attempt to pop elements that may not exist in the list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if the option exists in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to pop it. We also need to handle the case where the push upstream information is not found in the error message.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    if push_upstream:
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

The changes made include adding a check to ensure the index exists before popping items from the list. Additionally, we added a check for the existence of `push_upstream` before using it to replace the argument.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also address the issue posted on GitHub related to this bug.
