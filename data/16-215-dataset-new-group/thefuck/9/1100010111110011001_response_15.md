The cause of the bug is that the pop method is being called twice on the same index after removing the first occurrence of '--set-upstream' or '-u'. This results in an IndexError because the list becomes empty after the first pop operation.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` line and adjust the `push_upstream` extraction to ensure it starts from the correct index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version removes the second `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` call and ensures that the `push_upstream` extraction is correct. This version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
