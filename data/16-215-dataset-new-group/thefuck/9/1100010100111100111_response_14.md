The bug in the function `get_new_command` is causing an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when the command includes the `-u` option. This is happening because the `upstream_option_index` is being set to 2 instead of 1.

The bug occurs because the code doesn't account for the fact that when the `-u` option is included in the `command.script_parts`, the index of the option is 1, not 2. This causes the subsequent pop operation to access an index that is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle both options `--set-upstream` and `-u` and ensure that the pop operations are performed on the correct index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

With this correction, the function now correctly accounts for the index of the `-u` option and the subsequent pop operations are performed on the correct index. This will resolve the `IndexError: pop index out of range` issue and the function should now work as expected.

This correction will also fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue #538 "Fix suggestions for git push -u origin".
