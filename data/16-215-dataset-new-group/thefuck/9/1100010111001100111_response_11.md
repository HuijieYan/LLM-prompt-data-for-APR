The cause of the bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it does not properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command's script parts. Additionally, the function incorrectly extracts the pushed branch from the stderr message.

To fix this bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument from the command's script parts.
2. Extract the pushed branch from the stderr message using a more reliable approach.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    original_script = command.script_parts[:]
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_index = -1

    if upstream_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_index:  # Check if there's an argument after the flag
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git push ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(original_script), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag and its argument correctly, and extract the pushed branch from the stderr message in a more reliable way.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issues.
