The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value from the given `git push` command and then use the last 3 lines of the `stderr` to construct the new command. However, there are multiple issues with this implementation. Here's a breakdown of the potential errors and the reasoning behind them:

1. Error in `upstream_option_index` assignment:
   The function first sets `upstream_option_index` to -1. Then, it tries to find the index of `--set-upstream`, and if not found, it tries to find the index of `-u`. However, there's a logic error in this approach because the second condition is not dependent on the first one. This means that if `-u` is found, `upstream_option_index` will be set to its value, irrespective of whether `--set-upstream` was found or not. This causes the `-u` statement to always override the `--set-upstream` index.

2. Incorrect popping of elements:
   When removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts`, the function pops the same index twice. This leads to an `IndexError` because the index being popped is no longer present in the list during the second pop operation.

3. Inconsistent parsing of command suggestions:
   The line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` extracts the git push suggestion from `stderr`. This assumes that the wording of the suggestion will always follow the current pattern, which may not always be the case.

To rectify these issues, we need to ensure that we properly address the location of each argument before popping the indices. Additionally, we should validate the extraction of command suggestions based on the stderr message to make the function more robust.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Check if '--set-upstream' was not found to consider '-u'
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the argument of --set-upstream or -u
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the suggestion from stderr and construct the new command
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('    git push'):
            return line.strip()

    return 'git push'  # Fallback to default command

```

The corrected function makes sure to handle the inclusion of both `--set-upstream` and `-u` properly without overriding the index. Additionally, it transforms the error message parsing to a more robust approach to accurately extract the suggested command.
