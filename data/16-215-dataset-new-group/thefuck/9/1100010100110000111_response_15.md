## Analysis
The buggy function is not correctly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command. This is causing an IndexError when trying to pop the elements that do not exist in the list.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function is not correctly handling the case when '-u' option is passed in the command, leading to an IndexError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if '-u' option is present in the command.
2. If so, remove it and its argument from the command.
3. Then extract the upstream branch from the stderr and replace it in the command to correct the suggestion.

## The corrected version

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, 
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option = '--set-upstream'
    if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    else:
        upstream_option = '-u'
        if upstream_option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(upstream_option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
Fixed the issue by checking for both '--set-upstream' and '-u', and removing them along with their arguments from the command parts. Then extracted the upstream branch from stderr and replaced it in the command. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
