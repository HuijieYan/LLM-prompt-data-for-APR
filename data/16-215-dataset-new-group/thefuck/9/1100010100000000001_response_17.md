## The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Change from 'is' to '!=' to fix the condition
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index - 1)  # Subtract 1 to remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

## Explanation
The bug in the original function lies in the incorrect condition for checking the index of the upstream option. The condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is incorrect because it will only work if the index is exactly -1, which is not the intended behavior. The correct condition should be `if upstream_option_index != -1` to check if the index was found.

Additionally, when removing the upstream option and its argument, both index positions need to be removed from the `command.script_parts`. This was fixed by subtracting 1 from the index when removing the argument.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy for fixing the bug is to correct the condition for checking the index of the upstream option and to ensure that both the option and its argument are removed from the `command.script_parts` when found.

By making these changes, the function will work as intended and provide the correct new command.
