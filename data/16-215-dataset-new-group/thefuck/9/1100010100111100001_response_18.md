The buggy function is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command, then get the new command and replace the `push` command with the new git command suggested by the error message.

The cause of the bug is that after removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` always returns 'push --set-upstream origin master', even if the initial command didn't contain these options, leading to the previous command getting added twice to the new command.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify whether the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options were originally present and handle the splitting and partitioning of the stderr string more carefully.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    original_command = ' '.join(command.script_parts)
    
    new_command = original_command.replace('-u', '').replace('--set-upstream', '')
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]
    if 'origin' in push_upstream:
        push_upstream = push_upstream.split()[-3]
    else:
        push_upstream = push_upstream.split()[-1]
        
    return f'git {new_command} {push_upstream}'
```
