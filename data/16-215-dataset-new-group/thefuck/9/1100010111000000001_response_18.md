In the provided code, the buggy function "get_new_command" is supposed to manipulate the git push command by removing the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command, and then replacing "push" with the output of "git push" from the command's stderr.

As for potential error locations, the issue could be in the logic used to locate and remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command, as well as in extracting the output of "git push" from the stderr.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect manipulation of the script_parts list and the extraction of the "git push" output from the stderr. This is leading to incorrect command transformations, causing the failing tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify and remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the command, and extract the output of "git push" from the stderr. Then we should replace "push" with the extracted output in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(index)
        script_parts.pop(index)  # remove the argument as well
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = " ".join(script_parts).replace('push', push_upstream)
    return new_command
```

In this corrected version, we make a copy of the command.script_parts list to avoid modifying the original list. We then correctly identify and remove the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option and its argument from the copied list. The "git push" output is extracted from the stderr as before, and then we replace "push" with the extracted output in the new command.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass successfully.
