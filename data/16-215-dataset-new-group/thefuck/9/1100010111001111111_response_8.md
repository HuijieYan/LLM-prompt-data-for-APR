The bug in the get_new_command function is caused by incorrect handling of the --set-upstream and -u options in the command.script_parts list. The function is also not correctly extracting the push_upstream value from the command.stderr.

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check for both --set-upstream and -u options in the command.script_parts list and remove them if found. Then, it should properly extract the push_upstream value from the command.stderr and use it to construct the new command.

Here's the corrected version of the get_new_command function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
