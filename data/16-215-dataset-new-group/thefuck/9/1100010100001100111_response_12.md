The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly handling the removal of the --set-upstream or -u arguments from the command script parts. Additionally, the extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr is incorrect, leading to an incorrect replacement of the arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not accurately identifying the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' arguments and not properly handling the extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately remove the --set-upstream or -u arguments from the script parts and correctly extract the upstream branch from the stderr message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git push --set-upstream ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we are checking if '--set-upstream' or '-u' exist in the command script parts, and if so, we are accurately finding and removing their indices. Additionally, the extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr message is modified to accurately get the desired part of the string.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issues and provide correct suggestions for the git push -u command.
