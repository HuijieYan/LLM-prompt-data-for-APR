The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and it is also not correctly extracting the push destination from the error message. This results in incorrect output for the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and also extract the push destination from the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output for each case. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding the incorrect suggestions for git push -u origin.
