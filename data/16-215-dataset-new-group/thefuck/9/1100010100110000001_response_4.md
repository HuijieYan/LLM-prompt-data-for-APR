There are several issues present in the given buggy function. 

1. The error message indicates an `IndexError` with `pop index out of range` when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list.

2. Additionally, the try-except blocks for finding the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` are not functioning as expected. The second try-except block will always overwrite the value set in the first try-except block.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `upstream_option_index` variable may not be getting the correct index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. The pop operation might be out of range for the `command.script_parts` list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect index values and the redundant pop operations. When trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, the particular index to remove may not exist, thus causing the out of range error. Also, the redundant pop operation inside the `if` condition is attempting to remove the same index twice.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` exists in `command.script_parts`, and get their index values.
2. If the index exists, only perform the pop operation once and return the new command.
3. Use a better error handling mechanism to avoid out of range or index errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = None
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index is not None:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if pop didn't make the list smaller
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Perform another pop to remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
``` 

This corrected version properly checks for the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, then removes it from the list, effectively avoiding index out of range issues. Also, it takes into consideration that the pop operation can make the list smaller, so it ensures to check the length before performing the second pop.
