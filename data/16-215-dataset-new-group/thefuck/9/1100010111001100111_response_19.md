The buggy function `get_new_command` fails to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and their respective values from the command, as intended. Instead, it always removes the last element of `command.script_parts` when it should be removing the elements at `upstream_option_index`and the index right next to it.

The cause of the bug is that the code to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and their respective values from the command is incorrect. It always removes the last element of `command.script_parts`, regardless of the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. This leads to incorrect command generation, causing incorrect returns for the failing test cases.

To fix the bug:
- We will properly remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and their respective values from the command, using the correct index obtained from `upstream_option_index`.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # remove the --set-upstream or -u option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # remove the argument for --set-upstream or -u

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # update the command with the correct push_upstream value
    new_command = " ".join(command.script_parts)
    if new_command.endswith("push"): # if the new_command ends with "push", append the push_upstream value
        new_command += " " + push_upstream 
    else:
        new_command = replace_argument(new_command, 'push', push_upstream) # else replace the argument of "push" with push_upstream
    
    return new_command
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
