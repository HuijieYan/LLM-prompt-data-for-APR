There are multiple issues with the given buggy function. The primary issue is that the script_parts list does not contain the '-u' argument. This causes an IndexError when trying to remove the element at the index of '-u'.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves checking if the '-u' argument exists in the command before attempting to remove it from the script_parts list. Additionally, the push_upstream variable should be extracted using a more robust method to handle the variability in git's error messages.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git push ')[2].strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version first checks if the '-u' and '--set-upstream' arguments are present in the script_parts list before attempting to remove them. Then it extracts the push_upstream value from the command.stderr using a more robust method. This approach should resolve the IndexError and correct the behavior of the function.
