The bug in the `git_push.py` file is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop an element from an empty list. This occurs because only one of the try-except blocks will succeed in finding the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, leading to an incorrect value of `upstream_option_index`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and handle the case when these options are not found properly.

Based on the expected values and types of variables, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `upstream_option_index` is properly assigned and handles the case when the options are not found without causing an IndexError.
