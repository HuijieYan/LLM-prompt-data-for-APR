## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, and then use the resulting list to construct a new git command. It then extracts the upstream branch from `command.stderr` and replaces the push argument in the new command with the extracted upstream branch.

### Potential error locations
1. The logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts` might not be working correctly.
2. Extracting the upstream branch from `command.stderr` might not be working as expected.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function is not correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the extraction of the upstream branch from `command.stderr` might not be accurately capturing the git push information.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Use a more robust method to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`.
2. Verify that the extraction of the upstream branch from `command.stderr` is accurate and reliable.

### The corrected function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Check if --set-upstream was found, if not then check for -u
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Only proceed if the option was found
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].split(' ')[-1]  # Update the extraction logic for the upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function makes the following changes:
1. Fixes the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`.
2. Adjusts the extraction logic for the upstream branch from `command.stderr` to more accurately capture the git push information.
