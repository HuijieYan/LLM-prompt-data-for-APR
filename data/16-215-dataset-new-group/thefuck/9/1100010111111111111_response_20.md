The issue in the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `git push` command, causing the `IndexError: pop index out of range` error. This error occurs when the `upstream_option_index` is not found and remains at its initial value of -1, causing the subsequent pop operations to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is correctly updated when either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found in the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the `command.stderr` contains the correct suggestion for pushing upstream.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    suggestion = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip()
    if suggestion.startswith('git push --set-upstream'):
        return suggestion
    else:
        push_upstream = suggestion.partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, it checks the `command.stderr` for the correct suggestion and uses it if available. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test case passes.
