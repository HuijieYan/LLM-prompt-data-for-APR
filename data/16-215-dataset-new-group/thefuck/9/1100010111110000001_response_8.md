The bug in the `get_new_command` function lies in the logic used to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command, as well as in the parsing of the stderr in the `push_upstream` assignment. The `IndexError` occurs at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` when an index error is triggered on a non-zero position index where no value is found in `command.script_parts`. 

The cause of the bug is that the code doesn't correctly handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not present in the command, causing the subsequent code to fail when trying to modify the list using non-existent indices. 

To fix the bug, the function should check if `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, the `push_upstream` should be parsed from `stderr` in a safer way that ensures it is extracted correctly, even when the error message contains different formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.partition('git ')[2].split('\n', 1)[0]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected logic checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` properly and safely removes it if present. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `stderr` is modified to handle variations in the format of the error message. With these changes, the `get_new_command` function should be able to handle different cases and is expected to pass the failing test.
