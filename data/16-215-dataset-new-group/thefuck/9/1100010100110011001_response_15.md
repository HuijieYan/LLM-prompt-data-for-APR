The buggy function is supposed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the script_parts, then extract the suggested command from the stderr and replace 'push' with the suggested command.

The error message states that an IndexError occurred when trying to pop an element from command.script_parts. This implies that the index provided to the pop() function is out of range.

The cause of the bug is that the script attempts to remove the same index twice from `command.script_parts`. If the first index removal attempt is successful, the second attempt might fail as the index could be out of range due to the removal of the first index.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the index only gets removed once if it exists. To do this, we will modify the code to remove the index only if it exists, and then extract the suggested command and replace 'push' with it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
This corrected function ensures that the index is removed only if it exists. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
