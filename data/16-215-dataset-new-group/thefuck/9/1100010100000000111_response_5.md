## Analysis
The buggy function is designed to remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the git push command. However, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect removal of the option and its argument from the command. The issue on GitHub also confirms that the suggested command is not being generated correctly.

## Error Locations
1. The code in the try-except blocks is not working as intended to find the index of --set-upstream or -u in the command.
2. The removal of the option and its argument from the command is not being handled properly.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of searching for and removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the git push command. This results in the incorrect generation of the suggested command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use a single try-except block to find the index of --set-upstream or -u in the command.
2. Properly remove the option and its argument from the command.
3. Ensure that the correct push_upstream value is obtained from the command.stderr.

## Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of --set-upstream or -u in the command
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        # Remove the option and its argument from the command
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Obtain the correct push_upstream value from the command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
