The cause of the bug in the provided `get_new_command` function is that when the `-u` flag is found, the function tries to remove it from the list of script parts twice, even if it has already been removed after the first try. This causes an `IndexError` when trying to pop the same index from the list again. Additionally, the function does not handle the case if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` flag is not found in the command.

To fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of both flags and remove them if found, without trying to remove the same index twice. And then, we need to extract and return the correct new command based on the provided stderr.

Below is the corrected version of the function that should pass the failing tests:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# This is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for the presence of --set-upstream or -u flags and remove them if found
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extracting the correct new command based on the provided stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    new_command = ''
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            new_command = line[4:]
            break

    return new_command
```

With this corrected version, all the failing test cases should pass, and the function should now handle the removal of `--set-upstream` and `-u` flags properly, as well as extract the correct new command based on the stderr.
