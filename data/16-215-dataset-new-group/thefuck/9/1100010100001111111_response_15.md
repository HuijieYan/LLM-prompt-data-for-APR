The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is incorrectly identifying the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options in the `command.script_parts` list and then removing it along with its argument. This leads to incorrect output and fails to meet the expected values.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, resulting in the incorrect removal of these options from the `command.script_parts` list.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the correct index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options is identified and removed from the `command.script_parts` list. Additionally, we need to extract the correct push command from `command.stderr` to replace the argument as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected function first extracts the correct push command from `command.stderr`. Then it checks if `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in `command.script_parts` and removes them if found at their respective indices. Finally, it replaces the argument and returns the updated command.

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue.
