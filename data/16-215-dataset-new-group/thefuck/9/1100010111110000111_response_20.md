## Analysis
The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the input command and replace the `push` argument with the suggested argument obtained from the `stderr` of the command. The `stderr` contains the suggestion provided by `git` for the `push` command. The function `get_new_command` is failing to handle the `-u` or `--set-upstream` options properly, resulting in errors when trying to modify the `command.script_parts` list.

### Error Locations
1. The code to handle `--set-upstream` and `-u` options is not correctly updating the `upstream_option_index`.
2. The pop operation on `command.script_parts` is causing an `IndexError` when the option index is not found.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `-u` and `--set-upstream` options. The code is also not checking if the option is present before attempting to remove it. This results in an `IndexError` when the option is not found, as seen in the failing test and the corresponding error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the code to correctly handle both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options and their corresponding indexes.
2. Add checks to ensure that the option is present before attempting to remove it to prevent `IndexError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Removing the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Removing the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version contains updated logic to handle the removal of `-u` and `--set-upstream` options and their arguments. Additionally, it includes checks to prevent `IndexError` when the options are not found. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
