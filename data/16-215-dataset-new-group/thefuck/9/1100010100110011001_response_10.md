## The strategy for fixing the bug
The bug is caused by a wrong index being removed from the `command.script_parts` list. The bug occurs when the `-u` option is passed, as it doesn't handle the index correctly. The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the removal of the index by finding the correct index first before removing it.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Should be removed from here
    else:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('push')  # If no -u or --set-upstream, find 'push' index

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
