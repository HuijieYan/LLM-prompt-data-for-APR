There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function `get_new_command`:

1. The `upstream_option_index` variable is being initialized with `-1` and then being checked if it's not equal to `-1` with `is not`, which might cause issues. 
2. The logic to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list seems to be problematic. 
3. The extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` might not be capturing the correct value.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments. The logic to remove these options and their arguments from the command parts list seems to be flawed. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` might not be capturing the correct value.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, and ensure that the `push_upstream` value is extracted accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in script_parts:
            option_index = script_parts.index(option)
            script_parts.pop(option_index)
            script_parts.pop(option_index)
            
    # Extract push_upstream from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This modified version of the function should accurately handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, and extract the correct `push_upstream` value, thus passing the failing test.
