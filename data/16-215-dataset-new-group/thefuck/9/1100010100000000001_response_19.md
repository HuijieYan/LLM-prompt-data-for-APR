The buggy function is designed to modify the git command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments and replacing the 'push' argument with the actual upstream branch.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The code does not properly handle the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are not present in the command.
2. The use of index on `command.script_parts` without checking its existence can raise an `IndexError`.
3. The final return statement may not handle the case when the command.stderr does not have the expected format.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it assumes the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command and does not have proper error handling for cases when these options are not present. Additionally, the script does not handle the case when the command.stderr does not have the expected format, leading to potential index out of range errors.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to add proper error handling for the absence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the command, and to check the existence of the expected elements before accessing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the upstream branch from the stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # Handle the case when the stderr does not have the expected format
        return None
```
In the corrected version, we handle the absence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options by checking their presence before accessing their index in the `command.script_parts`. We also added error handling for the case when the command.stderr does not have the expected format.
