The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the `upstream_option_index` being incorrectly reused for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, which results in an incorrect position for popping the elements from `command.script_parts`. This causes an `IndexError` at runtime when trying to pop an element at an index that is out of range.

To fix this bug, we need to use separate variables for `--set-upstream` and `-u` option indices, and then check if either of them are not `-1` before popping the elements from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    set_upstream_index = -1
    try:
        set_upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    u_index = -1
    try:
        u_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if set_upstream_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(set_upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(set_upstream_index)
    elif u_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(u_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(u_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
