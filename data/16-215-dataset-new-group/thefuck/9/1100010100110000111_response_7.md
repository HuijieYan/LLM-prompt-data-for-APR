## Analysis
The buggy function is designed to handle the `git push` command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, then reconstructing the command with the correct upstream branch. The error message indicates an `IndexError` when attempting to pop elements from `command.script_parts`.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error location is when the function is trying to remove elements from `command.script_parts` using the `pop` method. This could be because there might be cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the command, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to remove non-existent elements.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the function attempting to remove elements from `command.script_parts` without checking if those elements actually exist. In the failing test case, the command 'git push -u' triggers an IndexError because no such element `-u` exists in `command.script_parts`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check whether the elements `-u` or `--set-upstream` exist in `command.script_parts` before attempting to remove them.

### Corrected Version
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are present in command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    # Extract the correct upstream branch from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Reconstruct the command with the correct upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated version checks for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts` before attempting to remove it. If the option is present, it removes it and then proceeds to reconstruct the command. This should fix the bug and resolve the failing test case.
