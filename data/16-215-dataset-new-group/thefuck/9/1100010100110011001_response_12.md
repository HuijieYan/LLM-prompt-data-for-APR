The bug in the function is causing an IndexError. The buggy function is attempting to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list even if the index is out of range. This is caused because the `upstream_option_index` is being set to `-1` when the searched index is not found, and later the `pop()` method is being called without properly checking if the index is valid.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `upstream_option_index` is greater than or equal to 0 before removing the element from `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this fix, the function will properly handle the index out of range error and provide the expected output for the failing test.
