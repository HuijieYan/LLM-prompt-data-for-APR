## Correction of the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The bug was caused by the incorrect use of the `is` operator when checking if `upstream_option_index` was not equal to -1. It should have used the `!=` operator instead.

The corrected version checks for the index of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, removes both the option and its argument when found, and properly extracts the correct `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

This corrected version will satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
