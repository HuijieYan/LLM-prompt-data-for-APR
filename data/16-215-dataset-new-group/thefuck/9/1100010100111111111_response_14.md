The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by incorrectly removing both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from the `command.script_parts`, which leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements that are not present in the list.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function should only remove the specified option and its argument from the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the `push_upstream` variable needs to capture the correct value from the `command.stderr` message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options correctly and extract the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`. This fix should address the `IndexError` and ensure that the function returns the expected new command based on the input `Command`.

The corrected version of the function above should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
