The cause of the bug is that the `upstream_option_index` is set to -1 and is not getting changed to the correct value when it is found in the script_parts. This results in not finding the index and trying to pop an index that is not there, which leads to the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we will need to update the logic for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the script_parts of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version now checks for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts` and sets the `upstream_option_index` accordingly. This ensures that the correct index is used to remove the elements from `script_parts`.

With this corrected version, the function should work as expected and pass the failing test.
