First, let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test. The function `get_new_command` takes a `Command` object as a parameter and tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `script_parts` attribute of the `Command` object. Then, it gets the suggested command from the stderr and replaces the 'push' argument with the extracted string.

However, there are several issues in the function that lead to the failing test:
1. The function does not correctly handle the cases where `-u` or `--set-upstream` is included in the `script_parts` list.
2. The function assumes that the suggested command will always be the third-to-last line of the stderr, which might not be the case.
3. The function pops an element from `command.script_parts` without checking if it's present, leading to an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Check both cases for `-u` and `--set-upstream` and their potential arguments.
2. Extract the suggested command in a safer and more reliable way.
3. Ensure the popping of elements from `command.script_parts` does not cause an IndexError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for opt in ('--set-upstream', '-u'):
        if opt in command.script_parts:
            opt_index = command.script_parts.index(opt)
            # Remove the option and its argument
            command.script_parts.pop(opt_index + 1)  # Argument
            command.script_parts.pop(opt_index)  # Option itself

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines[::-1]:
        if line.startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    # If no valid suggested command was found, fallback to the default
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This version handles both `-u` and `--set-upstream` options correctly, as well as extracting the suggested command in a more reliable way.
