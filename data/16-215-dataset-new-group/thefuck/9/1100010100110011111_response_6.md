## Correction

Looking at the buggy function, the issue seems to be with the removal of elements from command.script_parts. It is possible that the index for removing an element is going out of range, causing the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for removing elements from command.script_parts to avoid the IndexError. We also need to gather the correct push_upstream value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2].strip()
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
