The issue with the buggy function seems to be that it is not properly detecting the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and removing them from the command script parts in all cases. The failing test and corresponding error message indicate that the index for popping the script parts is out of range in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to properly detect the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and remove them, and then extract the suggested push command from the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the cases where '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are present and extract the suggested push command from the error message. This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
