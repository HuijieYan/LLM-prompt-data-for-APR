The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` to occur and preventing the function from running successfully. 

The cause of the bug is that when the `-u` argument is passed and removed from the `command.script_parts` list, the subsequent attempt to remove the element at the same index of `upstream_option_index` is causing an `IndexError` because that index has already been removed due to the first element being removed.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that we use the correct index to remove the `-u` argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if upstream_option_index == -1:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index + 1] == '-u':  # Check if the next element is '-u'
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)  # Remove the next element after '-u'
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove '-u' or '--set-upstream'
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the `IndexError` issue will be resolved, and the test case should pass.
