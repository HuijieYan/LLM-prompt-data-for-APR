The cause of the bug is that the function `get_new_command` does not handle the case where `--set-upstream` or `-u` does not exist in the `command.script_parts`. To fix this bug, we need to check if either of these options exists before trying to find their index in the list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them. It then proceeds to extract `push_upstream` from the stderr as before and returns the modified command accordingly.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. Furthermore, this fix should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
