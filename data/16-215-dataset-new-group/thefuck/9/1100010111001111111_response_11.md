The issue with the buggy function `get_new_command()` is that it fails to correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command, and the logic for constructing the new command is also incorrect.

The buggy function tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and then constructs a new command by replacing the 'push' argument with the value obtained from parsing the error message. However, the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is flawed, and the construction of the new command is also incorrect.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option along with its argument from the command.
2. We also need to construct the new command by replacing the 'push' argument with the correct value obtained from parsing the error message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# The corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command
    script_parts = command.script_parts.copy()
    if '--set-upstream' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = script_parts.index('-u')
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    # Construct the new command by replacing the 'push' argument with the correct value
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    script_parts.append(push_upstream)
    new_command = ' '.join(script_parts)
    return new_command
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing tests and provide the expected output for each case. This fixes the issue reported in GitHub and ensures the correct behavior for the `git push -u` command.
