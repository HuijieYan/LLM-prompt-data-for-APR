The bug in the `get_new_command` function is the incorrect removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its corresponding value from the command script parts. This leads to incorrect replacement of the `push` command with the extracted `push_upstream` value. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to correctly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its value, and then replace the `push` command with the correct value.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command = command.script.strip().replace('push', push_upstream, 1)
    return new_command
```

This correction ensures that the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and its value is handled correctly, and the `push` command is replaced with the correct value obtained from the stderr. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
