The buggy function `get_new_command` in the `git_push.py` file is designed to get a new command for `git push` by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and appending it to the end of the new command. The error message indicates an `IndexError` raised in this function.

The issue occurs when the command that is passed as input already has the upstream definition. The buggy function attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list even though they are not present, resulting in an index out of range error.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1

    # Check if '--set-upstream' is in the command arguments
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    else:
        # Check if '-u' is in the command arguments
        if '-u' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # If upstream option is found, remove it and its argument
    if upstream_option_index >= 0 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle both the presence and absence of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and no longer raise an `IndexError` when attempting to remove non-existent options.
