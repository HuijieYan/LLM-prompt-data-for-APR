The bug in the provided function is that it is incorrectly removing the '-u' option and its argument from the command script parts, which is causing the git push -u myfork suggestion to break. 

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly removes both the "--set-upstream" and "-u" options from the command script parts without checking if they are present in the list of script parts.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if "--set-upstream" or "-u" are present in the command script parts before attempting to remove them.
2. If either of them is present, we should remove only the option and its argument from the command script parts.
3. Return the correct suggestion for git push -u myfork.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if "-u" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if "--set-upstream" or "-u" is present in the command script parts before removing them. It only removes the option and its argument from the command script parts if they are present. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
