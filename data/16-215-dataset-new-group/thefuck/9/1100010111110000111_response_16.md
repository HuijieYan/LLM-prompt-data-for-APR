Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` when trying to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list. The bug is specifically related to the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to first check if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `command.script_parts` list, and then pop them if they are found. Additionally, the `push_upstream` variable is incorrectly calculated and should be fixed.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the --set-upstream or -u option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2].split()[-2]  # Get the correct push_upstream value
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options, calculates the `push_upstream` value correctly, and should pass all the failing test cases as well as resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
