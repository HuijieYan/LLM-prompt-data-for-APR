The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify a git push command by removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments, and then appending the fetched upstream branch to the command. However, it seems that the function is not handling the options and their arguments and fetching the upstream branch correctly. This is likely causing the failing test cases.

The bug seems to be in the code that determines the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments in the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the code for fetching the upstream branch from the `command.stderr` might also be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should first verify if `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present, and then remove them along with their arguments. It should then correctly extract the upstream branch from the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        idx = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # remove the argument as well
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        idx = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)
        command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # remove the argument as well

    # Fetch the upstream branch from the stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the function is expected to pass the failing test cases and return the correct new command for git push based on the given inputs.
