Explanation:
The bug in the original function is caused by the incorrect check for the index of the '-u' option. If the '--set-upstream' option is found, it will overwrite the value of 'upstream_option_index' with the index of '-u' regardless of whether it has already been found. This can lead to the removal of the wrong argument when both options are present in the command.

To fix the bug, a new check for the index of '-u' is added after the check for '--set-upstream'. This ensures that if the '--set-upstream' option is found, the index of '-u' is only used if it has not already been found. This prevents incorrect removal of arguments from the command.

The corrected function addresses the bug and ensures that the correct arguments are removed from the command when '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are present, resulting in the expected output for the given test case and resolving the GitHub issue.
