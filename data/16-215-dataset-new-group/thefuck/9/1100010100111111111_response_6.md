The cause of the bug is that the command.script_parts.remove method is being called twice in the buggy function, resulting in an IndexError for the second pop operation when the script_parts list becomes empty. To fix this bug, we need to remove the specified element only once and also handle the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is not present in the script_parts list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function checks if '--set-upstream' or '-u' is present in the command.script_parts list and removes it only once if found. It also accounts for cases where these options may not be present. This should resolve the IndexError issue and make the function behave as expected.
