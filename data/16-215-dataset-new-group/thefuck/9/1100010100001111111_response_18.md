The bug in the function `get_new_command` is that it is mistakenly removing the `-u` flag and its argument from the command when it shouldn't.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly removing the `-u` flag and its argument based on their indices in `command.script_parts`, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the removal of the `-u` flag and its argument.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the `push_upstream` based on the command input, without mistakenly removing the `-u` flag and its argument. This change addresses the issue reported in GitHub and ensures that the function generates the correct output for the given input.
