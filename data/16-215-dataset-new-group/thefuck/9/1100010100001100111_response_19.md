The buggy function is failing to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option from the `git push` command and then concatenate the suggested command from the stderr.

The potential error location within the function is related to the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and the concatenation of the suggested command from the stderr.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, and then concatenating the suggested command from the stderr. This results in an incorrect new command being formed.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, as well as the concatenation of the suggested command from the stderr. We also need to ensure that the correct parts of the `command.script_parts` are used to form the new command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove its argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2].strip().replace('--set-upstream', '').replace('-u', '').strip()
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts`. Then, if the option is found, we remove it and its argument from `command.script_parts`. We also adjust the extraction of the suggested command from `command.stderr` to replace `--set-upstream` or `-u` before using it to form the new command.
