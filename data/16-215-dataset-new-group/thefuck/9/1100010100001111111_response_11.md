The bug in the buggy function `get_new_command` is that it does not correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command. The `upstream_option_index` is not updated correctly, leading to incorrect handling of the options and arguments. This issue is reflected in the failing tests and the expected values.

To fix this bug, the code needs to correctly identify and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then extract the correct `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if 'fatal' in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-4:]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected version correctly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then extracts the correct `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy all the failing tests' expected values.
