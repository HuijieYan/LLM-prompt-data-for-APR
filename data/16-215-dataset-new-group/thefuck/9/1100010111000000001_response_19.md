The cause of the bug is that the code is not properly handling the case where the --set-upstream or -u flag is not present in the command, which is leading to an index out of range error.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the index of --set-upstream or -u is found before trying to pop the corresponding parts of the command script. We also need to ensure that we are properly handling the case where the stderr does not contain the expected information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2] if len(stderr_lines) >= 3 else "origin master"
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test.
