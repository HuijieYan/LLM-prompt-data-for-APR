The buggy function is attempting to modify a git push command by removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument from the command. The function then extracts the push suggestion from the stderr of the original command and replaces the push argument in the modified command.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Using `index` method without handling IndexError and ValueError exceptions.
2. Incorrectly checking the condition for if upstream_option_index is not -1.

The cause of the bug is that if the --set-upstream or -u option is not found, the function still proceeds to remove the element at index -1, which may result in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle exceptions when using the `index` method and correctly check the condition for whether the upstream_option_index is not equal to -1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
