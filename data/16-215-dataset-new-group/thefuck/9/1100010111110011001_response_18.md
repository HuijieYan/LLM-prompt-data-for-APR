```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_indexes = [i for i, x in enumerate(command.script_parts) if x in ['--set-upstream', '-u']]
    for index in sorted(upstream_option_indexes, reverse=True):
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The bug in the original function was that it attempted to pop the elements of command.script_parts multiple times in the wrong way, and it did not properly handle the case where there might be multiple occurrences of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command. This led to an IndexError when trying to pop elements that did not exist in the list.

The corrected version of the function uses a list comprehension to find all occurrences of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command and then removes them from command.script_parts. By using sorted with reverse=True, it ensures that we only remove elements from the end of the list, preventing any IndexErrors. 

This change allows the function to handle multiple occurrences of '--set-upstream' or '-u' properly, and it should now pass the failing test case.
