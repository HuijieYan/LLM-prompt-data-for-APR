## Corrections:

### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command, and then replace the `push` argument with the value obtained from the error message. However, the current implementation has a couple of issues:
1. The code always tries to remove both `--set-upstream` and `-u`, even if one of them does not exist in the command.
2. The code does not properly handle the case where `push` has additional arguments after it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the code not properly handling the presence of `-u` and `--set-upstream` in the command, and not properly extracting the value to replace the `push` argument.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the command and remove it if it exists.
2. Extract the value to replace the `push` argument from the error message, considering the case where `push` may have additional arguments after it.

### Bug Fix:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts
    if '--set-upstream' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command_parts:
        index = command_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        index = -1

    if index != -1:
        command_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the option
        command_parts.pop(index)  # Remove its argument

    error_message_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = ' '.join(error_message_lines[-3].split()[1:])  # Extract the value to replace 'push'

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated function properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument and extracts the correct value to replace the `push` argument from the error message.
