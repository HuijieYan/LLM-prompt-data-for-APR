The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and its argument from the command.script_parts list. This results in an IndexError when trying to pop the elements from the list because the index is out of range.

To fix this bug, we can search for the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options separately and remove them from the command.script_parts list. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the command contains other options or arguments after the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument if it exists

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By checking if the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are present in the command and handling the removal of these options and their arguments properly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
