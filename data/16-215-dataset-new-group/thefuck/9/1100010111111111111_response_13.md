In the buggy function, the issue seems to be that when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present in the command, the function attempts to remove it and its argument from the `script_parts` list. However, if the `-u` option is present, it is removing the same index twice, resulting in an `IndexError: pop index out of range` when there are not enough elements left to pop from the list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is present, it is removed only once, and then the command is constructed correctly using the `push_upstream` extracted from the stderr message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated function should now pass the failing test cases and handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly to construct the new command.
