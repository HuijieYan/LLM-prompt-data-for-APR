The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument when parsing the command. The function should be identifying and removing these options and their arguments before using the remaining command to construct the new command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly updating the command.script_parts when removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument. This results in the incorrect construction of the new command.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly identify and remove the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and then construct the new command using the remaining script parts.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    new_command_parts = command.script_parts + [push_upstream]
    return " ".join(new_command_parts)
```

In the corrected version, we properly update the command.script_parts after removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and then construct the new command using the updated script parts.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument, and pass the failing test cases.
