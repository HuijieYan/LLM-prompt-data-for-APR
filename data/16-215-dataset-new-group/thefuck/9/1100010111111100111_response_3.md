To fix the bug in the `get_new_command` function, we need to properly handle the cases where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are present in the `git push` command. The bug is caused by incorrectly removing the `-u` or `--set-upstream` and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

The proposed strategy for fixing the bug is to check if either `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts`, and if so, remove them from the list and then reconstruct the `git push` command with the correct upstream branch.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct upstream branch is extracted from the error message in `command.stderr` and used to replace the argument in the new command.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check if --set-upstream or -u are present in the command and remove them
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    # Extract the correct upstream branch from the error message in command.stderr
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().split(' ')[-2]  # Extract the upstream branch
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    # If the correct upstream branch is not found, return the original command
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the cases where `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `git push` command and extracts the correct upstream branch from the error message in `command.stderr`. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
