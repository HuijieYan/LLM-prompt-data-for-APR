The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the input `command` and return the final command with the `push` argument replaced by the one suggested by git.

The potential error in this function lies in the logic to identify the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and remove them from the `command.script_parts`. The way it is currently implemented can result in removing them incorrectly, especially when using multiple options.

The cause of the bug is because both `--set-upstream` and `-u` are being handled independently, so if the script parts list contains both values, the handling of the second one will not behave as expected.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to properly handle both options while checking for their presence in the command, removing them correctly, and then replacing the necessary parts in the command with the `push` argument suggested by git.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Process --set-upstream and -u options efficiently
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            idx = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # Remove the option
            if len(command.script_parts) > idx:
                command.script_parts.pop(idx)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This version of the `get_new_command` function efficiently processes both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, handles their removal correctly, and then replaces the necessary parts in the command with the correct `push` argument suggested by git. This should pass the failing test cases provided.
