The bug in the function `get_new_command` is caused by the way the upstream_option_index is being used to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts list. The bug causes an IndexError when attempting to remove the option if it doesn't exist in the list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the option exists in the list before attempting to remove it, and also modify the logic to correctly extract the 'origin' and 'branch' values from the stderr message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].split()[-1]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function checks if the options '--set-upstream' or '-u' exist in the list before attempting to remove them. It then correctly extracts the 'origin' and 'branch' values from the stderr message to generate the new command.

This fix should resolve the issue and the failing test case provided.
