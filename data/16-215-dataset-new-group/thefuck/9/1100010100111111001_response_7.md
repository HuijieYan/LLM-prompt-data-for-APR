The bug is identified in the function get_new_command where the last pop operation within the if block causes the IndexError due to pop index out of range for the negative indexing. The bug is causing the tests to fail since the output of the function includes '--set-upstream' when it shouldn't in some cases.

To fix the bug, the pop operations should remove at the correct index to avoid any index errors. Additionally, the condition where the pop operation is executed should be handled properly, so as not to remove items outside the array boundaries.

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
