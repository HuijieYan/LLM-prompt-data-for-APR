The issue with the given function is that it is not correctly handling the case when the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option is not present in the command. This can result in an IndexError when trying to split the `command.stderr`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. 
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    remove_upstream = False
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        remove_upstream = True
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        remove_upstream = True

    if remove_upstream:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `in` operator to check if '--set-upstream' or '-u' are present in `command.script_parts` and remove them if needed. Then, we only attempt to split `command.stderr` and create the new command if the upstream flag was present in the original command.
