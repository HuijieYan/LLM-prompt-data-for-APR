The buggy function has an issue with removing the --set-upstream or -u options and its argument from the git command and then replacing the push command with the suggested command. The problem occurs because it incorrectly removes the options and their arguments, leading to an IndexError when trying to pop index out of range. This is evident from the failing test, the corresponding error message, and the runtime input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the options and their arguments are correctly removed from the command before replacing the push command with the suggested command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of options and their arguments and provide the expected output for the failing test cases. This should also address the issue posted on GitHub.

If this correction does not resolve the issue or if there are additional requirements, further investigation and modifications may be necessary.
