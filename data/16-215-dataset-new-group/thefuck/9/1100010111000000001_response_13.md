# The problem with the get_new_command function is that it does not handle the case when the argument for --set-upstream or -u is also provided in the command. It only handles the case when the argument is removed, not when it is present.

# To fix the bug, we need to check if the --set-upstream or -u is present with an argument, and if so, remove both the option and the argument.

# Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for i, part in enumerate(command.script_parts):
        if part in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
            command.script_parts.pop(i)
            if i < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(i)  # also remove the argument if present

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function will remove both the option and its argument if provided, and then proceed to construct the new command as intended.
