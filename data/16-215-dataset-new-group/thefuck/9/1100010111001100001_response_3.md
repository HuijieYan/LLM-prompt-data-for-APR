The issue with the buggy function is that the `upstream_option_index` is incorrectly calculated and causes the wrong arguments to be popped out. The calculations lead to the wrong indices being stored and then used to pop elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

The `get_new_command` function works with the `Command` object which is partly based on the `command.script_parts` list. This list is modified in the `get_new_command` function by popping elements, which creates an inconsistency between the `command` object and the modified list. This inconsistency then leads to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

To fix the bug, you should correctly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list and then modify the list accordingly. However, to ensure consistency, it would be better to handle the modifications using the `command` object rather than the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected function first checks if the arguments `--set-upstream` or `-u` are present in the `command.script_parts`. If they are, they are removed using the `remove` method. This way, we ensure that the `command` object and `command.script_parts` list remain consistent, avoiding the bug that occurred in the previous implementation.
