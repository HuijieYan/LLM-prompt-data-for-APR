The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect removal of the `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to pop the element at the specified index that doesn't exist.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be fixed.
