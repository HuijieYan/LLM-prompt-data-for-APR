The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then return a new command with the corrected argument. However, the buggy function has a bug where it removes the argument for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and it also has an issue with correctly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` input.

The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly removing the argument for both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options, and it is also not correctly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` input.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we only remove the argument for the specific option that has been found in the command, and we need to correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr`.
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    else:
        try:
            upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
        if upstream_index > -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    push_upstream = push_upstream.replace(' ', '', 1)  # remove the first space
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
