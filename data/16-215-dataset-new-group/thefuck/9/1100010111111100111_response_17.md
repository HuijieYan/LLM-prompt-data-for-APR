The buggy function `get_new_command` has a few issues, which are causing the failing tests and the corresponding error. The main issue seems to be with the `upstream_option_index` as it is not being set correctly, leading to an incorrect command being returned.

The buggy function tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the command and then uses the `stderr` to extract the desired output. However, the error occurs when the index for `upstream_option_index` is used to remove items from `command.script_parts`. This index is not always being set correctly, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct index for `--set-upstream` or `-u` is found and then use it to remove the items from `command.script_parts`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u'
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    # Remove the option and its argument from the command if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):  # Check if there is an argument to remove
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
