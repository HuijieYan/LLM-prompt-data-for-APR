The buggy function is intended to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' argument and its value from the command, as well as extract the suggested git push command from the stderr. However, there are several potential error locations within the function:

1. The use of `is not` to check if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 is incorrect. It should be `!=`.
2. Using `command.script_parts.index()` without checking if the argument exists can cause a ValueError and potentially crash the program.
3. The assumption that the push suggestion is always in the same position in the stderr may not be correct.

To fix the bug, we can use a better approach:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Removing --set-upstream or -u and its argument
    modified_command = command.script_parts.copy()
    for i in range(len(modified_command)):
        if modified_command[i] == '--set-upstream' or modified_command[i] == '-u':
            modified_command.pop(i)  # remove the argument
            modified_command.pop(i)  # remove the option
            break  # stop after removing the first occurrence

    # Extracting git push suggestion from stderr
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = ''
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'git push' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]  # extract the push suggestion
            break  # stop after finding the push suggestion

    return replace_argument(" ".join(modified_command), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected function, we loop through the `command.script_parts` list to find and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument. Instead of relying on a fixed index, we search for 'git push' in the `stderr` to extract the push suggestion, providing more flexibility for different outputs.

Additionally, we use a copy of `command.script_parts` to avoid modifying the original list, which could potentially cause issues with other parts of the program.
