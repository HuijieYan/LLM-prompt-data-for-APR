The root cause of the bug is that when `-u` is used as an argument in the `git push` command, it exists at index 2, so popping the `upstream_option_index` from index 2 results in the array that doesn't exist. As a result, an `IndexError` is thrown.

To fix this bug, the function needs only to pop the upstream option index once. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
