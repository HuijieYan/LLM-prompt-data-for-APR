Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.
Following these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values, the GitHub issue.
2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the runtime input/output variable values, the GitHub Issue information.
4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version. The corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub.


Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

## Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

#### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

### Case 2
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '-u']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push -u, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

#### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

### Case 3
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '-u', 'origin']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push -u origin, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

#### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

push_upstream, value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

### Case 4
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push', '--set-upstream', 'origin']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push --set-upstream origin, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

#### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
upstream_option_index, value: `2`, type: `int`

command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
```
