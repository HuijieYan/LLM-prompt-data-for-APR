The buggy function has an issue where it is not properly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `git push` command, causing the failing test cases to not produce the expected output. The bug is caused by incorrect logic for finding and removing the options. The `upstream_option_index` is not being correctly updated when `-u` is found, and the removal of the option and its argument is not being handled properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the removal of the options and their arguments, as well as properly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the command's stderr.

```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

# the corrected version of the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index > -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index:  # check if there is an argument to be removed
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the logic issues and correctly handle the removal of options and arguments from the `git push` command, leading to the expected output for the failing test cases and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
