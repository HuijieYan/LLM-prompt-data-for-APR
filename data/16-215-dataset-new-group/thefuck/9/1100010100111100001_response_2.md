The code is failing because the `upstream_option_index` is being set as -1 initially, but then being updated with a new value from the `script_parts` list when checking for the '-u' option. However, the index for '-u' is being used to remove both '-u' and its argument from the `script_parts` list, which results in an `IndexError` since the value from '-u' index is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `upstream_option_index` based on whether the initial value `-1` is changed or not, and also adjust the logic to remove both the option and its argument from the `script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Remove the argument for the option as well
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
