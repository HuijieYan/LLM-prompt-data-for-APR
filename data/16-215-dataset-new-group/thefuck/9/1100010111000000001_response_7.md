The buggy function get_new_command has a few potential error locations:
1. The try-except blocks to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts list may not be executed properly.
2. The logic to remove the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their respective arguments from the command.script_parts list may have issues.
3. The extraction of the push_upstream value from the stderr may not be accurate.

The cause of the bug is that the function get_new_command does not correctly identify and remove the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their arguments from the command, and it doesn't accurately extract the push_upstream value from the stderr.

To fix the bug, the function should:
1. Use if-else statements instead of multiple try-except blocks to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts list.
2. Adjust the logic to remove the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their respective arguments from the command.script_parts list.
3. Ensure the correct extraction of the push_upstream value from the stderr.

Here's the corrected version of the get_new_command function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u'
    upstream_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from command.script_parts
    if upstream_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_index:upstream_index+2]

    # Extract push_upstream from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should now accurately handle the '--set-upstream' and '-u' options and their arguments, and correctly extract the push_upstream value from the stderr. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
