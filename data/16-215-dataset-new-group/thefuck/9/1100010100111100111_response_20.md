The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an `IndexError` when the `-u` option is present in the `git push` command. The function is attempting to remove the given index twice, which results in an out-of-range error.

The cause of the bug is that the code tries to remove the index twice even if the index only exists once. This is leading to the `IndexError` when the `-u` option is present.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove it from the list. Additionally, we should only look for the `-u` option if the `--set-upstream` option is not present, as only one of these options should exist in a valid `git push` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the `-u` and `--set-upstream` options properly and should pass the failing test.
