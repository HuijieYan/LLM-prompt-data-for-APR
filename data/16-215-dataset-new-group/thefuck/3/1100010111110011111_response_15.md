## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `Popen` call with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` may not be returning the correct version of Fish shell.
2. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line may not be correctly decoding and stripping the output.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The `info` function is expected to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it seems to be using a command (`['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`) that does not accurately return the version. The failing test provides a clear indication that the retrieved version is not what is expected. The error message specifies the difference between the actual and expected version, helping to identify the root cause of the bug. 

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used by `Popen` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, we need to handle the output correctly, such that the retrieved version matches the expected version.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.replace('fish', '').replace('version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `Popen` command has been updated to `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Then the obtained version output is processed to extract the version number and returned as expected. This updated version of the function should pass the failing test and complete the GitHub issue's fix.
