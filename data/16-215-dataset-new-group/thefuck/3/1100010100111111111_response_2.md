Based on the error message and the runtime and expected input/output values, it seems like the issue lies with the value of 'version' being returned by the function. The function is currently extracting the version of the Fish shell incorrectly, resulting in an unexpected output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the version information from the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This leads to an incorrect 'version' value being returned by the function and failing the assertion in the test.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly extract the version from the output of the command and format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version information and format it as expected, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
