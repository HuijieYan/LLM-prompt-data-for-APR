```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The bug in the original code is that it does not handle the case where the `Popen` call fails to execute properly, which can happen due to various reasons such as the `fish` shell not being installed, or an incorrect path to the `fish` executable.

To fix the bug, we need to handle potential exceptions that may occur when executing the `Popen` command. Additionally, we should also add a condition to check if the `version` variable is empty, indicating that the `Popen` command did not return the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            if not version:
                raise Exception("Failed to retrieve version information")
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Failed to retrieve shell information: {}".format(str(e))
```
