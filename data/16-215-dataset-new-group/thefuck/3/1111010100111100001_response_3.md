The buggy function is `info` in the `Fish` class, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` from the `subprocess` module to execute a command to retrieve the version of the fish shell. However, the function fails to correctly extract the version from the command output, leading to an assertion error in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the command output to retrieve the version. This is evident from the difference between the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should properly parse the version output from the command and format it into the expected 'Fish Shell x.x.x' format. This can be achieved by splitting the output by commas and taking the last element, and then formatting it into the desired string format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
