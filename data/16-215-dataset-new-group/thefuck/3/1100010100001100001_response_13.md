The issue in the buggy function is that it is using a MagicMock instead of actually executing the command to get the version of the Fish shell. This is likely causing the incorrect version to be returned.

To fix this issue, the Popen command should be executed to capture the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
