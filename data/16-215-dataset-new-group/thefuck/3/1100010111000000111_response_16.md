## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

The buggy function had a couple of issues:
1. It was using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish version.
2. It was not properly parsing the output to extract the version number.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues by using the correct command to retrieve the Fish version and then parsing the output to extract the version number.

The `test_info` function should now pass with the corrected version of the function.
