## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The issues with the original function and test were as follows:
- The original function used 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the Fish version, but the test was using 'fish, version' to get the version, leading to a mismatch in the test.
- The test expected the version to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' and the function was returning '3.5.9'.

The corrected function addresses these issues by using the correct command to get the Fish version and modifying the output to match the expectation of the test.

This version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
