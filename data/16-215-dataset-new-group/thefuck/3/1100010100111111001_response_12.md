The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect extraction of the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The function is currently expecting to receive only the version number, but the output includes the string "fish, version" as well.

To fix this bug, the function needs to extract the version number from the output correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly extract the version number from the output, and the failing test should pass.
