## The bug
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the `Popen` subprocess is called with the arguments `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is expecting it to be called with `['fish', '--version']`. This causes the function to incorrectly capture the version number, leading to incorrect output and failing of the test.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the arguments passed to the `Popen` subprocess to `['fish', '--version']` so that the correct version number is captured and returned by the `info` function. 

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
