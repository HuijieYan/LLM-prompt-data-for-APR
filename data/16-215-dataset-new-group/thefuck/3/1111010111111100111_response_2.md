### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
In the provided code, I made the following changes:
- Changed the command from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `--version` to obtain the current version of the Fish shell.
- Modified the parsing of the version to ensure that only the version number is extracted from the output.

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
