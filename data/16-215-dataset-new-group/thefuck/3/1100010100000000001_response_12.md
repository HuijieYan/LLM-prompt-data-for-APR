The potential error locations in the given buggy function are:

1. Process not being waited for before reading the output, which can result in empty output or incorrect data being read.
2. Not handling the potential errors that may occur during the Popen call or reading the output.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it does not properly wait for the `Popen` process to complete before reading the output. This can lead to reading incomplete or incorrect data from the process' output.

To fix the bug, the function should use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly wait for the process to complete and then read the output. Additionally, error handling should be added to handle any potential errors that may occur during the process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode == 0:
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return "Failed to retrieve version"
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error while retrieving shell information: {}".format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version, the `communicate()` method is used to properly wait for the process to complete and read the output. Error handling is also added to catch any exceptions that may occur during the process.
