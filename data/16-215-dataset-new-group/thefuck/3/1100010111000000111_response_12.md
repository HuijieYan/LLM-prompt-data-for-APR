The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The command used to get the Fish version might be incorrect, leading to incorrect output.
2. The decoding of the output from the subprocess might not be successful, resulting in a format that cannot be used to construct the return value.
3. The format used to construct the return value might be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call in the `info` function is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the decoding of the output is not handled correctly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to:
1. Use the correct command to retrieve the Fish version.
2. Handle the decoding of the output from the subprocess to get the version.
3. Construct the return value using the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
