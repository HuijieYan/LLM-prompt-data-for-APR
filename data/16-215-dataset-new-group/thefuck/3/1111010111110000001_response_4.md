The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, with some minor errors.

The line causing the issue seems to be `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` as it passes the wrong arguments to the `fish` command. Additionally, `Popen.return_value.stdout.read()` is not being used properly to capture the output.

The bug is caused by passing the wrong arguments to the `fish` command and improper handling of the output, resulting in a mismatch when compared to the expected output in the test.

To fix the bug, the correct command and arguments should be passed to the `fish` command and the output should be captured and decoded properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Corrected the command and arguments
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()  # Extract version from the output
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'  # Use f-string for better formatting
```

This corrected version uses the correct command and argument while invoking `Popen`, and properly processes the output to extract the version number.
