The buggy function fails to return the correct version of the Fish shell and does not match the expected value. This is due to the incorrect command being used to retrieve the version of the shell in the Popen call.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This will properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
