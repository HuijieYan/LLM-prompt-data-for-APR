## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `Popen` function may be causing a hang or recursive loop.
2. The `proc.stdout.read()` may not be handling the output of the command properly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `Popen` function not being handled correctly, leading to a hang or recursive loop. This is triggered when the `thefuck -v` command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the `Popen` function and its output properly. This may involve checking for any recursive loops and ensuring that the command output is processed correctly to prevent any hangs.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        with Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL) as proc:
            try:
                version = proc.communicate(timeout=5)[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
            except TimeoutExpired:
                proc.kill()
                return "Fish shell version could not be retrieved"
```
