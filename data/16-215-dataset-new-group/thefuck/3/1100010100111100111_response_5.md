The error in the `info` function is due to the incorrect output format. The function is returning "Fish Shell" followed by the version number, separated by a comma. The correct format should be "Fish Shell" followed by the version number, without the comma.

In addition, the function is not handling the case where the `Popen` command does not return the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the format of the output string and add error handling for the case where the `Popen` command does not return the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    try:
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    except AttributeError:
        version = 'unknown'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With the above fix, the `info` function should now return the correct format and handle the case where the `Popen` command does not return the expected output. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
