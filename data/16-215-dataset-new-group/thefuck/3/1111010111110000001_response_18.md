The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is not properly capturing the version of the `Fish` shell. The Popen command is trying to extract the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, however, the correct command to get the Fish shell version is `fish --version`. Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the output format. The current format is `fish, version 3.5.9` while the expected format is `Fish Shell 3.5.9`.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be modified to `fish --version`, and the output format should be corrected to match the expected format.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly obtain the version of the Fish shell, and the test should pass without any assertion errors.
