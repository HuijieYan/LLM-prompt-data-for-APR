The cause of the bug in the `info` function is that the command used to fetch the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` should be replaced with `fish --version` in order to get the correct version of the shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

In this corrected version, we changed the command to `fish --version` to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell. We also modified the return statement to extract the version number from the output of the command.

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
