The bug in the function `info` is that the `proc` object is not being properly communicated with to get the output. The `proc.stdout.read()` is not fetching the output as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to use `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly communicate with the process and get the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
