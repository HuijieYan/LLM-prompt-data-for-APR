The issue with the buggy function is that it is not reading the correct output from the `Popen` process and not formatting the output string correctly. The incorrect output also results in the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `Popen` process is reading the correct output and that the output is formatted as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

This corrected version includes splitting the `version` string to extract the version number and returning the formatted output as expected by the test case.
