## Analysis

The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it's currently not functioning correctly. It calls the `Popen` function with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version of Fish shell, but it's not handling the `Popen` process properly and is not decoding the output correctly.

## Error locations

1. The `Popen` process is not being handled properly.
2. The output of the `Popen` process is not being decoded correctly.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is causing a recursive loop when Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses the `thefuck -v` command, which triggers the `info` function in `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()`. The `info` function is not handling the `Popen` process properly, and the output is not being decoded correctly, leading to an infinite loop.

## Strategy for fixing the bug 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly handle the `Popen` process and decode the output from the shell command.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        proc.stdout.close()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version of the `info` function, the `communicate` method is used to properly handle the `Popen` process and get the output from the shell command. The output is then decoded correctly and returned as the version of the Fish shell, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
