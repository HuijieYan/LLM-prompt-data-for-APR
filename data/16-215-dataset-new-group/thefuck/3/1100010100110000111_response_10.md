## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with corresponding error message, the GitHub issue

The `info` function is meant to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` class to execute a command that retrieves the version of the Fish shell. The error message from the failing test indicates that the version retrieved includes the text "fish, version", which is not being handled correctly by the function. The GitHub issue indicates that this bug causes a recursive loop due to the use of the `thefuck -v` command when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The issue seems to be with the way the output of the `Popen` command is being processed, specifically how the version number is extracted from the output.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information
The bug is caused by the `info` function not correctly parsing the output of the `thefuck -v` command, which leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected and actual version strings. This causes a recursive loop when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used. The error message indicates that the version string obtained from the `Popen` command includes the text "fish, version", which is not being handled by the function.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The `info` function needs to be modified to correctly extract the version number from the output of the `Popen` command and format it as "Fish Shell \<version\>".

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract just the version number
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
