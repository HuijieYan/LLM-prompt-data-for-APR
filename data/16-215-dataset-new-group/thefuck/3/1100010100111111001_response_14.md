The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly capturing the version number from the output of the command. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is stripping the output of the command, which leads to an incorrect version number being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly capture the version number from the command output and then format it into the desired string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version captures the entire output string from the command, splits it by the comma, and then takes the second part (which contains the version number) before formatting it into the desired string.

This correction should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
