### The cause of the bug:
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. However, the output it receives includes the string "fish, version" before the actual version number, which is causing the assertion error in the failing test. The function is not correctly handling this output to extract the version number.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the function to properly extract the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This can be achieved by splitting the output string and keeping only the version number part.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly extract the version number from the output and return it as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', satisfying the expected output values and passing the failing test.
