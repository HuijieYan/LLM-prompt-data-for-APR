Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the `info()` function of the `Fish` class is not properly returning the version string for the Fish Shell. The `stderr` of the `Popen` call is being ignored, which leads to unexpected parsed output.

The cause of the bug is that the version string extracted from the stdout of `Popen` includes unnecessary characters such as "fish, version" in addition to the actual version number. This is causing the assertion to fail as it does not match the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the command executed by `Popen` and modify the way we extract the version information. We should only capture the version number without any additional characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    out, err = proc.communicate()
    version = err.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This version of the function uses `--version` to get the Fish Shell version, captures the standard error output for the version information, and strips unnecessary characters to only return the version number. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
