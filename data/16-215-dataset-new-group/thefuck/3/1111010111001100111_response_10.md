Based on the provided information, the issue appears to be caused by the incorrect command used to obtain the version of Fish shell in the `info` function. This leads to a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Fish shell.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to change the command used to obtain the Fish shell version, as well as addressing the recursive loop. The correct command to obtain the Fish shell version should be `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By replacing `echo $FISH_VERSION` with `fish --version` in the Popen command, the correct version of Fish shell will be obtained without triggering a recursive loop. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes.
