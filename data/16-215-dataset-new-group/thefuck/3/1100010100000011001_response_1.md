## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. However, the function seems to be using `proc.stdout.read()` to capture the output, which might be causing the issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by using `proc.stdout.read()` to capture the output from the shell command. This method may not be capturing the output correctly, resulting in an incorrect version value.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to capture the output from the shell command instead of directly using `proc.stdout.read()`.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
