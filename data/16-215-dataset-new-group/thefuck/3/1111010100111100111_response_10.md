The bug in the `info` function seems to be related to the value being returned not matching the expected value due to the presence of additional string information. This can be inferred from the failing test error message, which shows that the returned string contains extra information ("fish, version") not expected by the test. This information is also reflected in the runtime values of the variables before the function's return.

The GitHub issue suggests that the presence of additional string information causes a recursive loop, indicating that the extra string is problematic.

To fix the bug, the function should only return the version number without any additional string information. It can be achieved by splitting the version information extracted from the subprocess output and returning only the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function based on the analysis:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will return the version number only (without the "fish, version" prefix). This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and also address the recursive loop problem indicated in the GitHub issue.
