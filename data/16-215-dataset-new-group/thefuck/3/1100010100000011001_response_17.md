## Analysis
The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command in the shell and capture the output. However, the function is not properly capturing the output from the command and returning the version in the correct format.

The `proc.stdout.read()` method is used to read the output of the command, but the returned value is not being decoded properly and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace. This is likely causing the incorrect version string to be returned.

## Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to capture the version information.

## Fix
To fix the bug, it is necessary to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly capture the output of the command and decode it before returning the version.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
