The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The command being run with Popen is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` but the test function is expecting the command `['fish', '--version']`.
2. The use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` may not be handling the output of the command properly.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not properly retrieving the version of the Fish shell. This causes the failing test `test_info` to fail because it expects a specific version string.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `info` function to execute the correct command and handle the output properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected version, the `Popen` command is now running `['fish', '--version']`, which matches the expectation in the test function. Additionally, the output of the command is parsed to extract the version number, which is then used to construct the correct version string.
