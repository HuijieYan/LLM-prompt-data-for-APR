The bug in the provided function is caused by the use of Popen without waiting for the process to finish, which can lead to a hang in the shell initialization process when the function is called. The issue on GitHub mentions this specific problem and recommends a fix to prevent the hang.

To fix the bug, we need to add a `proc.wait()` after calling the `Popen` to ensure that the process finishes before reading the output. This will prevent the hang in the shell initialization process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will wait for the process to finish before reading the output, preventing any hang in the shell initialization process as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
