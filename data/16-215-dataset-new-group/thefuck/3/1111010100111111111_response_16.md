The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is expected to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is currently returning a version number with the string "Fish Shell" appended to it.

The cause of the bug is that the function is extracting the version number '3.5.9' from the output 'fish, version 3.5.9\n' provided by the `Popen` command, but it should return 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to extract the complete version information from the output and return the correct string formatted as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version appends the string 'Fish Shell' to the complete version information obtained from the output of the `Popen` command.

The corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
