To fix the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class, we need to update the command being passed to `Popen` and modify the way we retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command to retrieve version
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
1. The original command passed to `Popen` was incorrect. It was trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but we should be using `'fish --version'`.
2. The output of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is in the format "fish, version 3.5.9". We can split this string and retrieve the version number ("3.5.9") by splitting on the ", " and getting the second element.

With these changes, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test case. It satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
