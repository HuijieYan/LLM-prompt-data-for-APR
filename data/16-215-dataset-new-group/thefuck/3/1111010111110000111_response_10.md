The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class seems to have a couple of potential error locations. Firstly, the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` appears to be incorrect as it does not retrieve the version of the Fish shell directly. Secondly, the assertion in the failing test `test_info` suggests that the expected version is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual version is being fetched incorrectly from the command output.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell. As a result, the failing test is asserting the incorrect version leading to an assertion error. The GitHub issue also mentions that the usage of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the incorrect implementation of the `Fish.info()` method.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and format it to return as 'Fish Shell <version>'. The correct command should be 'fish --version' to get the version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(",")[1].strip())
```

The corrected version uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and formats it to return 'Fish Shell <version>'. This should resolve the failing test and the issue posted on GitHub.
