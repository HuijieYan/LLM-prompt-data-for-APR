The buggy function is the `info` function inside the `Fish` class in the file `fish.py`. The function is using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command and capture its output. However, the command being executed is incorrect, and the version is being parsed incorrectly from the output.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which is not retrieving the version correctly. Additionally, the output of the command is being incorrectly parsed.

To fix the bug, the command being executed should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to get the correct version output. Additionally, the output should be parsed to extract only the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output.
