The problem with the buggy function lies in how it retrieves the version of the Fish Shell. Currently, it uses the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', but in the failing test, the value returned is 'fish, version 3.5.9', which does not match the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This mismatch causes the failing test.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to parse the version string correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function now retrieves the Fish Shell version using the command 'fish --version', and correctly parses the version string to return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected in the failing test.

This change addresses the issue posted on GitHub and ensures that the function can accurately retrieve and format the Fish Shell version.
