## The cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function `info` in the `fish.py` file is not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell. The version returned by the function does not match the expected version, leading to a failing test.

The error message shows that the value returned by the function is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" while the expected value is "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

The root cause of this issue is that the function `info` is not correctly parsing the output of the command used to get the Fish shell version.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function `info` needs to properly capture the version of the Fish shell and format it according to the expected output.

The corrected version of the function should update the subprocess command to correctly capture the output of the Fish shell version and then format it according to the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command used to get the Fish shell version has been updated to `['fish', '--version']`, and then the output is parsed to only capture the version number, which is then formatted according to the expected output.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version capture.
