To fix the issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class, we need to update the command to check the Fish shell version by using the correct command and modifying the function to handle the output accordingly. 

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # Corrected version of the info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
1. The original command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` was replaced with `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. The output of the command is split by comma, and the second part (version number) is extracted for formatting and returning it.

By making these changes, the `info` function will now correctly retrieve and format the Fish shell version, resolving the failing test and addressing the GitHub issue.

This correction resolves the problem of fetch the version of the Fish shell and should be merged into the main codebase to fix the reported issue.
