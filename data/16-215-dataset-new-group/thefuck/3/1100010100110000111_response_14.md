## Analysis
The error message shows that the `info` function is not returning the correct version of the Fish Shell, which is causing a failing test. The issue on GitHub also mentions that the `info` function is causing a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Reading the output of the `Popen` process may not be capturing the correct version.
2. The format of the returned string in the `info` function may be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `info` is not capturing the correct version of the Fish Shell, which results in the `assert` statement failing. This is causing a test failure and potentially causing a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `Popen` process is executed correctly to capture the version of the Fish Shell, and the returned string is formatted in the correct way to pass the test and avoid a recursive loop.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is replaced with `proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]`. This change ensures that the correct version of the Fish Shell is captured and formatted in the expected way. This should resolve the failing test and the potential recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
