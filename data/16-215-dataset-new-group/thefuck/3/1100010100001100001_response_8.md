The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly waiting for the process to finish before reading the output. This could lead to reading an empty or incomplete output from the process.

To fix this, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Adding the `proc.wait()` line will ensure that the process has finished before reading the output, fixing the issue with the original buggy function.
