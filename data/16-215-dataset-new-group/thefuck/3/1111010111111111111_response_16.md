To fix the bug in the info method of the Fish class, let's modify the Popen call to use the correct command and arguments to retrieve the Fish version. Also, we need to adjust the parsing of the output to extract the version correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the correct command and arguments in the Popen call, and then extracting the version from the output correctly, we ensure that the info method returns the expected version of the Fish shell.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix should also address the issue reported on GitHub, as it addresses the problem with retrieving the Fish shell version.
