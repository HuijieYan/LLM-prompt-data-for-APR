## Analysis
The buggy function is the `info` function within the `fish.py` file. It uses Popen to execute a command to retrieve the Fish shell version. However, in certain cases, this can trigger a recursive loop, causing the system to hang.

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error locations within the `info` function include the use of Popen to execute the command and the way the stdout is read and decoded.

## Cause of the bug
The bug causes the system to hang when the `thefuck -v` command is used, which triggers a recursive loop due to the way the `info` function retrieves the Fish shell version. This is caused by the use of Popen to execute the command.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the method of retrieving the Fish shell version to avoid triggering a recursive loop. One approach could be to use a different method to retrieve the version and handle any potential recursive loop scenario.

## Corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception:
        return u'Fish Shell'
```
In the corrected version, we have handled the potential recursive loop scenario by using `proc.communicate()[0]` to retrieve the output of the command. Additionally, we have added a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the command execution.
