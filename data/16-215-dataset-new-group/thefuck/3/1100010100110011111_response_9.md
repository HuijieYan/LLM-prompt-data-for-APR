## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The `Popen` function is not being properly mocked in the test, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The `version` variable is being incorrectly parsed from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command, leading to the incorrect assert statement failure.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version from the command output and the incorrect mocking of the `Popen` function in the test. This results in the `info` function returning an incorrect version of the Fish shell, leading to the failing assert statement in the test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to correct the parsing of the version from the command output and properly mock the `Popen` function in the test to return the expected version string. Additionally, the version string should be correctly formatted to match the expected output in the assert statement.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(" ")[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
