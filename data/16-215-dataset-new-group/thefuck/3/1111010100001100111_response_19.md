The issue appears to be related to the usage of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop due to the `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()` method. The buggy function in the Fish class is the `info` method, which uses the `Popen` function to execute the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. 

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the `Popen` function is being mocked, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to read the stdout and decode the version.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `info` method to use the `check_output` function from the `subprocess` module, which provides a simpler and more reliable way to capture the output of a command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` method to resolve the issue:

```python
from subprocess import check_output

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `check_output`, we can directly capture the output of the command and decode it without encountering the issues related to mocking the `Popen` function. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
