The buggy function is the `info` method in the fish.py file. The function attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version by running a shell command, capturing the output, and then formatting it as the shell name and version. 

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not returning the expected value. The expected value should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' based on the provided input to the function, but the actual returned value is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The issue on GitHub also provides additional context that the `thefuck` plugin is triggering a recursive loop due to the bug in the `info` method.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the version from the command output and return the expected result.

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[1].strip()  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function should correctly extract the version from the command output and return the expected result of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as indicated in the failing test.
