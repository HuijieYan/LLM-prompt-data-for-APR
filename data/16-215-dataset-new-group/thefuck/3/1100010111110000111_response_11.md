The buggy function `info` in `shells/fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the version of Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the failing test in `tests/shells/test_fish.py` sets the value that `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` should return, and the `assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` comparison fails with the error message `AssertionError: assert 'Fish Shell f...version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

The GitHub issue provides some context that TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to this bug and that a fix is on the way.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to run `fish --version` instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to retrieve the version of Fish shell.

The corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By running `fish --version` instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and extracting the version from the output of `proc.stdout.read()`, we have fixed the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue in GitHub.
