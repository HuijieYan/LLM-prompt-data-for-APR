The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file is related to the command used to retrieve the Fish version. The failing test indicates that the expected version is '3.5.9', but the function is returning a version without the '3.5.9' string.

Upon analyzing the test function, it becomes clear that the Popen command is running the incorrect argument 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version'. Additionally, the failing GitHub issue suggests that the current implementation triggers a recursive loop due to an incorrect command.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be modified to pass the correct argument '--version' to retrieve the Fish version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should correctly retrieve the Fish version and pass the failing test.
