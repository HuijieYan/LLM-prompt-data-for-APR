## The potential error location within the buggy function

The potential error location within the `info` function is the command `'fish', '--version'` used with Popen, which should be corrected to properly capture the version of the Fish shell.

## Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is using the command `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to retrieve the Fish shell version, which is not the correct command. This results in the incorrect version being returned, causing the failing test case.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the command used with Popen to properly capture the Fish shell version. The correct command should be `'fish', '--version'`.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
