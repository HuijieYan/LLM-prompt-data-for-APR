## Analysis
The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell being used by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to retrieve the version may be causing the issue.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is likely caused by not properly waiting for the completion of the `Popen` process before trying to read the version. This results in empty or incorrect values being read from `proc.stdout`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the completion of the `Popen` process before reading the version.

## The corrected function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the completion of the process
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
