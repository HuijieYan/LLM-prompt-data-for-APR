The bug in the provided function `info` seems to be related to reading the version number of the fish shell incorrectly. The use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version is not correct. 

The `test_info` function is validating the `info` method for the fish shell by mocking the `Popen` object to return the version `fish, version 3.5.9` upon calling `stdout.read`. However, the `info` method returns a version string in an unexpected format, leading to an assertion error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the command used in the `Popen` call to retrieve the fish shell version correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this modification, the `info` function should correctly extract and return the version of the fish shell in the expected format, and the `test_info` function should pass without any assertion errors.
