## Solution

### Potential Error Locations
1. The function is not properly reading the output from the Popen command.
2. The format of the version string is not being handled correctly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function not properly reading and formatting the version string from the Popen command. This results in an assertion error when comparing the expected output with the actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly read the output from the Popen command and format the version string before returning it.

### The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly read the version string from the Popen command and return the expected output.
