Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue with the buggy function lies in the way it reads the version from the output of the subprocess.

The buggy function is using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to read the output from the subprocess and obtain the version. However, it appears that this method is not providing the expected output. Instead, it is returning a MagicMock object.

To fix this bug, the function should use `communicate()` method of the Popen object to read the output from the subprocess. This will ensure that the correct version is retrieved and returned as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly read the version from the output of the subprocess and return the expected result.
