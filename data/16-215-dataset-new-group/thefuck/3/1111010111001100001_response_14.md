The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell. However, the function is currently not retrieving the correct version.

The potential error location is in the Popen call, where the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is executed to retrieve the version. It seems like the command being executed is not retrieving the correct version value.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is not retrieving the correct version value from the Fish shell.

To fix the bug, we should modify the Popen command to directly get the version using the `--version` flag instead of trying to echo the version variable.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will extract the correct version of the Fish shell and return it as expected.
