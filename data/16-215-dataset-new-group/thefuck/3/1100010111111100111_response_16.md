## Updated/Copy/pasted the relative imported files for the fix:


```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
```


## From the above nature of relation:
In the info() function, the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is being used to fetch the fish version from the shell. However, the test is expecting 'fish --version' to be called instead to fetch the version information.


## A corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
