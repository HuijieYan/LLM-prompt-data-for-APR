## Analysis
The function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish shell, but it currently has a bug where it triggers a recursive loop that hangs the initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Identifying the Bug
The bug seems to be with the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop. The line `proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` opens a subprocess to execute the command, but it is not handling the recursive loop issue.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered when using the `thefuck -v` command, leading to a hang during initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the subprocess call to handle the recursive loop issue. One way to do this is to check for the specific case where `thefuck -v` is being used and handle it appropriately.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if '-v' in sys.argv:  # Check if the command is thefuck -v
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return u'Fish Shell'  # Return just the name if not using thefuck -v
```
