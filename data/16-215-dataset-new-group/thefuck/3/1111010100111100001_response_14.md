The bug in the `info` function is that it returns the entire output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, instead of just the version number. This is evident from the error message and the provided runtime values, where the expected version is `3.5.9` but the actual output is `fish, version 3.5.9`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will extract the version number from the output of the command and return it along with the shell name. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
