The cause of the bug is that the command used to extract the Fish version is incorrect, resulting in an incorrect version being returned.

To fix the bug, we should change the command used to extract the Fish version to `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the function should now return the correct version of Fish shell and pass the failing test.
