## Cause of the bug
The bug in the `info` function is caused by the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` within the `Popen` call. It is causing a recursive loop, resulting in the hanging of the Fish Shell initialization when used in conjunction with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be modified to avoid triggering the recursive loop. One approach could be to directly get the shell version without using an environment variable that triggers the recursive loop.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function directly uses the `--version` option with the `fish` command to retrieve the version, avoiding the use of the environment variable that triggers the recursive loop. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and provide the expected output.
