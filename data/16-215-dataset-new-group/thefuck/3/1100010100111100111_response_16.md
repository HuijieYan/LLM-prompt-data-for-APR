The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the output from the Popen command. The current implementation does not properly parse the output and includes unnecessary characters such as "fish, version" in the version string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the version string from the output of the Popen command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

With this correction, the function will extract the version number from the output of the Popen command and return it in the correct format.

This fix should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the `info` function.
