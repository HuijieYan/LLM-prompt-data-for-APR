The buggy function is the `info` method in the `fish.py` file. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it currently has a bug that causes it to return an incorrect version.

The potential error in the function is with the command being executed using Popen. The command being executed is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the expected command should be `['fish', '--version']`.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command is not executed correctly, and it is fetching the version from an incorrect command. This results in the function returning an incorrect version.

To fix the bug, the command being executed by Popen should be changed to ['fish', '--version'] to correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(" ")[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version of the function, when the `info` method is called, it will correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell using the `['fish', '--version']` command and return the expected output, fixing the bug and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
