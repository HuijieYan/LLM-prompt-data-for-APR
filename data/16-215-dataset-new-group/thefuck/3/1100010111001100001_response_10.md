The cause of the bug in the provided function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` command used is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` which is incorrect as it tries to echo the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable. Instead, we should use `['fish', '--version']` to get the version of the Fish shell.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `Popen` command to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
