## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The issue seems to be with how the version of the Fish shell is being retrieved in the `info` function. The `Popen` call is not working as expected and causing the version to be retrieved incorrectly, leading to a failing test.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information
The `info` function uses `Popen` to execute a command to retrieve the Fish shell version, but it fails to do so properly. This causes the retrieved version to include unwanted characters, leading to a failing test.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command executed by `Popen` retrieves the Fish shell version correctly and without any unwanted characters. Additionally, it's important to address the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue by not triggering it during the shell initialization.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(", version ")[1])
```
The corrected version uses `communicate()` to get the output of the command and retrieves the version by splitting the string. This should resolve the issue with unwanted characters and ensure that the correct version is returned. Additionally, any code that triggers recursive loops should be addressed to prevent hanging during shell initialization.
