To fix the bug in the `Fish.info` function, we need to modify the Popen call to use the `--version` flag to get the version of the Fish shell. The current command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not providing the correct version as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish Shell from the system. The failing test is showing an assertion error because the expected version '3.5.9' is not being returned by the `info` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the Popen call to use the `--version` flag and retrieve the version string. We can then modify the returned string to match the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the `Fish.info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish Shell and pass the failing test. This also addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub report related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.
