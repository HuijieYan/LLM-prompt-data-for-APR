To fix the bug, we need to modify the `Fish.info` function to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `Fish.info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Explanation:
- The original function used the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which isn't a valid command to retrieve the version of Fish shell.
- By modifying the command to `fish --version`, we can properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
- The corrected function splits the output by `,` and selects the second part to extract the version number.
- This function should now successfully retrieve the Fish shell version and return it in the correct format.

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass and fulfill the expected input/output values.
