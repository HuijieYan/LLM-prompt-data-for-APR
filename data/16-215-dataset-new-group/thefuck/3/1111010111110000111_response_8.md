The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `info` method where the call to `Popen` and reading the output might not be returning the expected version number of Fish Shell.

The cause of the bug is due to the fact that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not capturing the correct version of Fish Shell. This is evident from the failing test as it shows the assertion error stating that the expected value 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual value 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed by `Popen` to correctly capture the version of Fish Shell.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

By modifying the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the correct version of Fish Shell will be captured. Also, by using the `replace` function to strip the unwanted text from the version, we ensure that the version returned is in the expected format.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
