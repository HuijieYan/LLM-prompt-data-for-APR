The cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the shell.info() function is not returning the expected output. The Popen command is using the wrong arguments to retrieve the Fish version, which leads to an incorrect output being returned.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the arguments passed to the Popen command so that it retrieves the Fish version correctly.

The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
