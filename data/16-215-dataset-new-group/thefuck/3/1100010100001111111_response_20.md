Based on the provided information, it seems like the bug in the `info` function is related to the way it retrieves the version of the Fish shell. The issue mentioned on GitHub also seems to indicate that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.

The potential error location is in the way the version of the Fish shell is being retrieved using Popen.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

To fix the bug, we should modify the way we retrieve the version of the Fish shell and handle the output of the command more effectively.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception (e.g., log the error, return a default value, etc.)
        return 'Fish Shell version not available'
```

In the corrected version, we are using `proc.communicate()[0]` to retrieve the output of the command and decoding it properly. We also added exception handling to gracefully handle any errors that may occur during the process of retrieving the version.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
