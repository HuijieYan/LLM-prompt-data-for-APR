## Analysis
1. The `info` function in `fish.py` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. However, the test case is failing, and the expected output is not being returned.
2. Potential error locations in the code include the command being executed, the process output not being captured correctly, and the formatting of the returned string.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the command being executed in the `Popen` call is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` while the test case is expecting `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the method of capturing the output using `proc.stdout.read()` is not correctly handling the output of the executed command due to the incorrect command and lack of encoding.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the command executed in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` as expected by the test case. Additionally, using `subprocess.run` instead of `Popen` and capturing the output directly without using `read()` can provide a more straightforward solution.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

In the corrected version, the command executed is modified to `['fish', '--version']`. The output from the process is captured using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` and then formatted to return the desired string in the correct format.

This corrected version should satisfy the failing test and the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted in GitHub by fixing the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.
