The buggy function `info` tries to get the name and version of the current shell by executing a command to retrieve the FISH_VERSION environment variable. It then attempts to extract the version from the output of the command. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Using `proc.stdout.read()` without checking for its completion or existence.
2. There is a missing import statement for `DEVNULL`.
3. `cache` is not defined.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it doesn't handle the case where the `Popen` process fails to execute or the output is not available. This can lead to the `proc.stdout.read()` function blocking indefinitely, causing the program to hang.

To fix the bug, we should check for the completion of the process and handle any errors that may occur during execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# this is the fixed function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode == 0:
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return "Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version"
    except Exception as e:
        return "An error occurred while retrieving Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

In the fixed version, we've used a `try-except` block to catch any errors that may occur during the execution of the `Popen` process. We also check for the return code of the process to ensure that it executed successfully before reading the output. If any errors occur, we return an error message indicating the failure.
