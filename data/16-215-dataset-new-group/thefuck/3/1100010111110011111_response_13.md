## Correction

The issue in the `info` function seems to be with the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not properly retrieving the version, which results in the incorrect output. The expected version is already defined in the test function `test_info`. To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version should be updated to match the expected version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this version, the command `'fish', '--version'` is used to retrieve the version. Additionally, the version string is cleaned up by splitting and trimming to ensure the output matches the expected value. This should resolve the issue and the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
