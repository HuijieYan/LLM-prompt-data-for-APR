## Explanation of the bug and its cause
The bug occurs because the `info` function in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is trying to extract the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Instead, it should use the command `fish --version` to obtain the version of the Fish shell.

The failing test in the `test_info` function is asserting that the returned version string from `shell.info()` matches a specific version string. However, the `info` function is returning the version in a different format, causing the assertion to fail.

The GitHub issue further explains that the problem with the current implementation of the `info` function is causing a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, leading to the `thefuck -v` command hanging in the Fish shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file should be modified to use the correct command `fish --version` to obtain the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, the returned version should be formatted to match the expected version string.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Formatting the version string
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
