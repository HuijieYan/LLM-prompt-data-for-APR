The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file is that it is using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, it should use `fish --version`.

The `info` function should be modified to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `fish --version` command. Additionally, the string parsing and formatting should be adjusted to match the expected output of the test.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

With this correction, the `info` function should be able to successfully retrieve the Fish shell version and pass the failing test. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the problem with the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version retrieval command.
