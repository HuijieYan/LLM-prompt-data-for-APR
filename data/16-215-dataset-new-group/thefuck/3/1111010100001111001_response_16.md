The bug in the `info` function is that it is not capturing the correct output from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command in the `Popen` process. The function is expecting the version number to be immediately available in the output of the `Popen` process, but this might not always be the case.

To fix the bug, we should wait for the `Popen` process to finish and then capture the output. This can be achieved by calling the `communicate()` method on the `proc` object, which will wait for the process to finish and then capture its output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc_output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = proc_output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now correctly capture the version number from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and return the expected output.
