### Fixed version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Fix the issue with recursive loop by extracting the version from the output
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the buggy function, the `version` variable is being set to the entire string output of the command, including the text "fish, version". This is causing the assertion error when comparing the expected output with the actual output. 

The fix involves modifying the `version` variable to extract just the version number from the output. This is achieved by splitting the string at "version " and taking the second part.

This fix should resolve the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue and enable the `info` function to return the correct version of the Fish shell.
