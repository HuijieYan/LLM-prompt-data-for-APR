To fix the buggy function, we need to update the info method in the Fish class to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Currently, the function is parsing the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, but the output format is unexpected. The function is also using the incorrect shell command to retrieve the version.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and the expected version string is not being correctly parsed from the output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen call to use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. We also need to update the parsing of the output to extract only the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the info method in the Fish class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version string
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This updated version of the info method uses the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and correctly parses the output to extract only the version string. It should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
