## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'fish'
        
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original `info()` function is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This is because the `info()` function is not properly defined and does not return the expected output. The original function did not handle the `version` variable and its format correctly which is causing the recursive loop.

To fix the bug, we need to properly define the `info()` function to return the name and version of the current shell without causing a recursive loop.

The corrected version of the function includes the proper initialization of the class and sets the name of the shell. Additionally, the Popen command and decoding of the output are properly handled to retrieve the version of the shell.

By making these changes, the function will return the correct shell name and version without causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
