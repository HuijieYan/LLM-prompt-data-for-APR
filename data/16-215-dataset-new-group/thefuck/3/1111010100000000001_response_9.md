## Analysis
The buggy function "info" is a method of the "Fish" class, which inherits from the "Generic" class. The function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish Shell). It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command and retrieve the output.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `Popen` call may raise an error if the "fish" command is not found.
2. Reading from the process output using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` may raise an error if the process has already completed or if there is an encoding issue.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it does not handle potential errors that may occur during the execution of the "fish" command. If the command fails or does not exist, the function does not handle this case, leading to potential exceptions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Popen` call is handled correctly, and we capture any potential errors during the process execution. We also need to properly handle the process output and potential encoding issues.

## Corrected Version
```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except (subprocess.CalledProcessError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
            return "Fish Shell: Unable to retrieve version information"
```

In the corrected version, we have used a try-except block to handle potential errors that may occur during the `Popen` call. We also use the `communicate` method to properly capture the process output and ensure that any encoding issues are handled. If an error occurs, we return a default message indicating the failure to retrieve the version information.
