### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `info` function is caused by the use of `Popen` to run the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. The issue on GitHub indicates that running `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop, and this is likely due to the recursive call to the `info` function within the `thefuck` plugin.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should avoid triggering the recursive loop by finding an alternative way to retrieve the Fish Shell version without using `Popen`.

### Corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.getenv('FISH_VERSION')
    if version:
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return "Fish Shell (version unknown)"
```

In the corrected version, we use `os.getenv` to retrieve the value of the environment variable `FISH_VERSION` directly, without spawning a new process. This approach avoids triggering any recursive loops and provides a safer and more reliable way to retrieve the Fish Shell version.
