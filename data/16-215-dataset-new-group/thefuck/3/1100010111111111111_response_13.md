The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The expected value is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the function is just fetching the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable.

To fix the bug, the Popen command should be modified to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, the `strip()` function should be used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the version value.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly fetch the Fish shell version and return it in the expected format. This will ensure that the failing test passes, and the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
