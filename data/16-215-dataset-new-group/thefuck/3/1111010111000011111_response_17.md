## Fixing the bug

The issue seems to be related to the `info` function in the `Fish` class within the `fish.py` file. The problem arises when the `info` function tries to fetch the version of the Fish shell using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, which causes a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `info` function to use the correct command for fetching the version of the Fish shell.

The corrected version of the `info` function should look like this:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.partition(' ')[2])
```

This fixes the bug by using the correct command to fetch the version of the Fish shell and resolving the recursive loop issue when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.
