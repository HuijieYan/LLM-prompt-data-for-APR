The issue with the `info` function is that it's using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command being used is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it should be `fish --version`. Additionally, the assertion in the test function expects `['fish', '--version']`, so this needs to be corrected in the `info` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

By using the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version (`fish --version`) and updating the return statement to extract the version from the output, the corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
