The issue in the `info` function is due to it using the wrong command and incorrectly parsing its output. The `Popen` call is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`. This results in incorrect output when trying to fetch the version of Fish Shell.

The fix for this issue is to update the command used in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly fetch the version of Fish Shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `['fish', '--version']` in the `Popen` call and then extracting the version number from the output, the function will now return the correct version of Fish Shell, and the failing test should pass.
