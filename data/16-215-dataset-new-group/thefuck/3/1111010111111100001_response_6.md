The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly retrieving the version of the Fish shell. This is evident from the failing test, which expects the version string to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but instead gets 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Instead, it is directly extracting the version without handling the extra text.

To fix the bug, the function should properly parse the output of the command to extract the version information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip())
```

In the corrected version, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is `['fish', '--version']`, and the output is correctly parsed to extract the version information. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
