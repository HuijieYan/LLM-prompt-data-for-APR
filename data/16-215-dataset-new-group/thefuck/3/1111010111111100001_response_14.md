The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong arguments. The call to Popen should be using `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This is causing the test to fail because it expects the version to be extracted from the output of `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen call to use the correct arguments.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
