The issue with the current `info` function in the `fish.py` file is that it is trying to get the Fish shell version by running the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` with the `Popen` function and reading the output to obtain the version number. However, the actual command for getting the version is `'fish --version'`. This causes the function to return the incorrect version and fail the test.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be updated to use `'fish --version'` to get the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here's a corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function will return the correct version of Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
