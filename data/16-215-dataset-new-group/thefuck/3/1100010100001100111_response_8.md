### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` plugin for Oh-My-Fish. The function attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing the output. However, the subprocess hangs when the `-v` flag is used, causing a recursive loop and leading to the plugin's failure.

### Strategy to fix the bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `-v` flag is used appropriately and avoid the recursive loop. We can achieve this by modifying the `info` function to check for the `-v` flag and handle it accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION', '-v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if version and version.startswith('TheFuck'):
        return u'Fish Shell with TheFuck plugin {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we modify the `Popen` command to include the `-v` flag to handle the case where the `-v` flag is used. Additionally, we check if the version string contains 'TheFuck' to avoid the recursive loop and return the appropriate shell version accordingly. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and prevents the recursive loop from occurring.
