The cause of the bug is that the function `info` is not returning the expected version string for the Fish Shell. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is being used to get the version, but it only returns the version number and not the complete name and version as expected by the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to include the complete name and version of the Fish Shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will now return the complete name and version of the Fish Shell as expected by the tests and will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
