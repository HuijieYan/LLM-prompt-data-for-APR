## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the `Popen` function to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, it seems to be causing a recursive loop issue when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Error location
The error is likely due to the way the `Popen` function is being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is causing a recursive loop because the `Popen` function is being used in a way that triggers the recursive behavior, causing the system to hang.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command execution using `Popen` doesn't cause a recursive loop. This could be achieved by modifying the way the command is executed or by using a different method to retrieve the Fish shell version.

## Corrected version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
