The bug in the `info` function is that it is trying to read the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, but it should be reading the output of the `fish --version` command instead. This leads to the incorrect version string being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `Popen` command to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly read the version of the Fish shell and return the expected result, passing the failing tests.
