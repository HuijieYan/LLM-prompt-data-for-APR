The bug in the `info` function is due to the incorrect parsing of the version output from the Fish shell. The `info` function is returning the string 'Fish Shell' followed by the unprocessed version output from the shell command.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to properly parse the version output and return it in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected version, we use the `--version` flag in the `Popen` command to directly retrieve the version information of the Fish shell. We then use `.split()[-1]` to extract only the version number from the output. This should address the issue with incorrect version parsing and ensure that the function returns the correct version in the specified format.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
