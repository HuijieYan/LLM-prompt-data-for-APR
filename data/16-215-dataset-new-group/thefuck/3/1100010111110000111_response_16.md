## Analysis
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the Popen command used to execute the shell command to retrieve the version is incorrect, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output in the test.

## Identified potential error locations
The potential error location is the Popen command and the way the shell version is being extracted from the output.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug is that the Popen command is running `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `fish --version`. This leads to the version output being incorrect, causing the failing test and the assertion error.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The Popen command should be modified to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, the way the version is extracted should be corrected to ensure it aligns with the expected output in the test.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
