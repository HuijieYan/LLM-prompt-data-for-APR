The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and concatenate it to the string "Fish Shell". However, the output from the `Popen` command concatenates "fish, version" to the version number, resulting in the error message.

To fix the bug, the output from the `Popen` command should be properly decoded and formatted to match the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Properly format the version string
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
