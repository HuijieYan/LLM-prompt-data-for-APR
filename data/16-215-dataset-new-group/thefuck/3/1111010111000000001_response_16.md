There are a couple of potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The command used in Popen to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect. It should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The decoding of the output from the process is not handled properly.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command is not requesting the version of the Fish shell correctly, and the decoding of the output from the process is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, the Popen command should be updated to request the Fish shell version using the correct command (`fish --version`) and the output from the process should be decoded properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test.
