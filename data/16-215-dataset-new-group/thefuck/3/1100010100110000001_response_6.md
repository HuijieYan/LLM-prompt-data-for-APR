The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is returning the string `'Fish Shell {}'` without including the version number. This is because the `read()` method of `proc.stdout` reads the output only once, so we need to use `communicate()` method to capture the output of the executed command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to use `proc.communicate()[0]` to capture the output of the executed command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
