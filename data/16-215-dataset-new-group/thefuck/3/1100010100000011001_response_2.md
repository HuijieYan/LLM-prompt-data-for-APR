The bug in the provided function is that it is attempting to read from the stdout of the Popen process before waiting for the process to complete. This can result in empty or partial output being read.

To fix the bug, we need to wait for the Popen process to complete by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version ensures that the function waits for the Popen process to complete before reading the output, thus providing the expected values and types of variables.
