The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `Popen` subprocess and its output. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` might not be handling the subprocess output correctly or there could be an issue with how the output is read from the subprocess.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly read the output from the subprocess.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `communicate()` method to read the output from the subprocess, we ensure that the function properly handles the subprocess and returns the correct version of the Fish shell.
