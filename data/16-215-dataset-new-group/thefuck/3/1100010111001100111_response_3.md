The buggy function is the info method in fish.py, which is meant to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses Popen to execute a command to retrieve the FISH_VERSION, but it is not using the correct command to get the version information. This causes the test to fail and the function to return an incorrect value.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to retrieve the fish version. The test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command 'fish --version', but the function is currently using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which does not return the correct version information.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the fish version. Additionally, the decode method should be changed to use the 'utf-8' encoding to correctly handle the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should correctly retrieve the fish version using the 'fish --version' command and return the expected result. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test case passes.
