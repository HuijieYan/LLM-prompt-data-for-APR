The bug in the `info` function is that it is not returning the correct shell version in the expected format.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to construct the version string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to properly retrieve the version information from the output of the command and format it as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```
