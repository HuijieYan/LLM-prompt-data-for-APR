## The bug
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to get the `FISH_VERSION` using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it's actually running `fish --version` according to the failing test. This mismatch between the expected command and the actual command is causing the error.

## Fix strategy
The fix strategy is to update the command in the `Popen` call to `fish --version` to match the failing test's expectations. This will ensure that the correct version information is obtained.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
