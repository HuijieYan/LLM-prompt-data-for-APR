## The source code of the bug-fixed function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it is using `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output of the process, but it should be using `proc.communicate()[0]` to get the output. This is likely causing the function to return an incorrect version string.

The fixed version of the function addresses this by using `proc.communicate()[0]` to correctly read the output of the process.

This should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
