The cause of the bug is that the command used in the Popen call is incorrect. The command should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

To fix the bug, change the command in the Popen call to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the function will return the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9".
