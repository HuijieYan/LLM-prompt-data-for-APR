## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is used to get the name and version of the current shell. However, it uses the `thefuck -v` command to get the version of the Fish shell, which triggers a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Identifying potential error locations:
1. The use of `thefuck -v` command in the `info` function.
2. The recursive loop caused by the command triggering a regeneration of functions in the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the use of `thefuck -v` command in the `info` function, which triggers a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing the shell to hang during initialization.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to find an alternative way to get the version of the Fish shell without triggering a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = ''  # placeholder for version
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    except Exception:
        pass  # handle exception, e.g., version not found
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we removed the use of `thefuck -v` command and added a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur when trying to get the version of the Fish shell. This prevents the recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin and returns the version of the Fish shell without causing a hang during initialization.
