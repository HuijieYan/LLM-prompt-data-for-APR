The bug in the `info` function is that it retrieves the version of the Fish shell incorrectly resulting in an unexpected format. This causes the failing test to compare the incorrect format with the expected format and hence fails.

The cause of the bug can be identified by looking at the function's implementation and comparing it with the failing test and the corresponding error message. The function uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, however, the actual output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'` which is not in the expected format `'3.5.9'`.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell needs to be modified to only return the version number without any additional text.

The following is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the version of the Fish shell in the expected format and pass the failing test.
