The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` and reading the output. However, the function currently includes a bug where the string `'fish, version '` is getting appended to the output of the command, causing the version number to be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the output string `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` is being concatenated with the hardcoded string `u'Fish Shell'`, resulting in the incorrect assertion failure during the test.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly parse the version number from the output of the executed command and format it with the 'Fish Shell' prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

With this fix, the `info` function will properly extract the version number from the command output and format it with the 'Fish Shell' prefix. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
