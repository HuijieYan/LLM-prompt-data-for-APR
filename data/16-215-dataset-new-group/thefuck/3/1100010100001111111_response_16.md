The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the function currently returns the version as "Fish Shell {}".format(version), which does not match the expected version string of "fish, version 3.5.9".

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is not returning the expected output. This is likely due to the command not being executed properly, or the output not being parsed correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to capture the correct output of the command and format it into the expected version string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Format the version string as expected
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format. This will resolve the issue posted in GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
