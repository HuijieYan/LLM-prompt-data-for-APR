## Fix for the Buggy Function

The issue seems to be that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not returning the correct version of the Fish shell, and this is causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The `info` function is using the `Popen` class to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capture the output in order to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the test is expecting the version output to be "Fish Shell `version`", while the actual version output is "fish, version `version`".

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we'll need to modify the command being run by `Popen` to get the correct version information. We'll also need to format the version information in the expected format "Fish Shell `version`". Additionally, we need to fix the command used to capture the version string and the format it's returned in order to ensure the correct version is captured and safely formatted.

### The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(' ')[2]  # Get the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
