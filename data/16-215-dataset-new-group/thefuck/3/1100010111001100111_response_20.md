The buggy function is the `info` function in the file `fish.py`. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a subprocess to echo the `$FISH_VERSION` environment variable. However, the test case `test_info` is failing because it is not getting the expected version value, and the `Popen` call is also not matching the expected arguments.

The potential error location is the subprocess call `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`. The issue might be related to the command used to get the Fish shell version.

The cause of the bug is that the subprocess call to get the Fish shell version is not producing the expected output. The failing test case is expecting the version to be '3.5.9' but it is not receiving this value.

To fix the bug, the subprocess call to get the Fish shell version should be updated to a command that correctly outputs the version. Additionally, the function should return the correct string format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the subprocess command is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly get the Fish shell version. Additionally, the version is correctly extracted from the output using `split()` and the function returns the version in the expected format. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test case pass.
