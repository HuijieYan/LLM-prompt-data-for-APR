The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the command passed to `Popen`. This causes a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin is trying to use `thefuck -v` to regenerate functions in the Fish Shell.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command passed to `Popen` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in a way that does not trigger the recursive loop.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

By using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the command passed to `Popen`, the recursive loop is avoided, and the `info` function should work correctly without triggering the issue reported in GitHub.
