The bug in the provided function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `Popen` object and its `stdout` attribute. The function is trying to read the output from the `Popen` object's `stdout` attribute, but it looks like it is using a MagicMock object instead.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure to properly wait for the process to finish and then read the output from its `stdout`. Additionally, we should handle any potential errors that might occur during the process execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Unable to get the Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

In this corrected version, we use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the process to finish and get its output and errors. We then decode the output and return the formatted version string. If an exception occurs during the process execution, we catch it and return an error message instead.
