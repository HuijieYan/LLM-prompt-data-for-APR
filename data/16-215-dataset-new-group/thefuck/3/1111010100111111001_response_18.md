The bug in the provided 'info' function is caused by the incorrect format of the output message. The function is supposed to return "Fish Shell 3.5.9", but it is currently returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly parse the output of the command. The '.strip()' function is causing the issue as it removes the entire string and only leaves the version number without the "Fish Shell" part, resulting in the wrong message. We need to modify the way we retrieve the version so that it matches the expected output.

A simple fix for this bug would be to change the Popen command to retrieve the entire output of the shell command, and then to format the version string accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the 'info' function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo Fish Shell $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the way we retrieve the output and then extracting the version number, we can ensure that the function returns the expected output. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
