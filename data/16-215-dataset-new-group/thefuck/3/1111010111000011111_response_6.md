## The bug
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is not executing the command `fish --version` correctly which is causing the failing test.

The issue is related to the use of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command instead of `fish --version`. This causes the function to improperly extract the version information, resulting in a failure in the test.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed by the `info` function. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, we should use `fish --version` to properly get the version information.

## The corrected version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```
