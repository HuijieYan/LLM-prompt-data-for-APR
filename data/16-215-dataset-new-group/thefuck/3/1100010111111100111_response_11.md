The issue with the current `info()` function is that it is trying to get the version of the fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output. However, the test is expecting the version to be extracted using `fish --version`.

It seems that the `info()` function is not returning the correct version of the shell.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `info()` function to run the correct command to get the version of the fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info()` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info()` function will now run the correct command to get the fish shell version and return it. This should resolve the issues with the failing test and the GitHub issue.
