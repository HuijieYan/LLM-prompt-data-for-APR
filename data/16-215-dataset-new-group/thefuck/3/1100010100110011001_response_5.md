## Plan for fixing the bug
The error message indicates that the `info` function is returning the incorrect version information. The expected version is "fish, version 3.5.9" but the function is returning "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This suggests that the command used to retrieve the version information is not returning the expected output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the version information in the `info` function and then format the output correctly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extracting the version from output
    version = version_str.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `fish --version` command instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, we can retrieve the correct version information. Then, by extracting the version from the output and formatting it correctly, we can ensure that the `info` function returns the expected version information.
