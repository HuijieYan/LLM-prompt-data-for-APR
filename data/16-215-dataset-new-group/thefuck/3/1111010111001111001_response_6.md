The cause of the bug is that the command passed to Popen is incorrect, and it should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This is evidenced by the failing test where the expected version value is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the actual version value is `'3.5.9'`.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be corrected to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
