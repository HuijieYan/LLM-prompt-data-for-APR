## Analysis 
The buggy function `info` is part of the `Fish` class. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell). It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command and retrieve the version. The potential error locations are the command being executed and how the output is processed. 

## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by not properly handling the process output. The `Popen` function returns a process object and the output should be read using the `communicate()` method or by iterating over the process output using `proc.stdout`.

## Bug Fix
The bug can be fixed by using the `communicate()` method of the process object to read the output properly and handle any errors that may occur during the process execution.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
