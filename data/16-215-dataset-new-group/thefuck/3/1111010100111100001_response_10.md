The bug in the provided function is that it's returning the shell version as "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell 3.5.9" as expected by the test.

The cause of the bug is that the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' executed inside the Popen call is returning the extra "fish, version" prefix in the output which is not handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to remove the extra "fish, version" prefix from the version string before formatting it into the final output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Remove the 'fish, version ' prefix from the version string
        if version.startswith('fish, version'):
            version = version[len('fish, version '):]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly return the shell version as "Fish Shell 3.5.9" and pass the failing test.
