The buggy function fails because it is trying to extract the version number from the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version'. Additionally, the call_args is not matching the expected value in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command to get the Fish shell version and modify the assertion in the test function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

And here's the corrected test function:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.return_value = b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
