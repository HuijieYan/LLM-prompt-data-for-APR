Based on the provided buggy function, test code, and the corresponding error message, we can conclude:

1. The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is not returning the expected result.
2. The `Popen` function is being called with the arguments `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which does not match the expected arguments `['fish', '--version']`.
3. The test is expecting the output to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', leading to an assertion error.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the arguments passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` and handle the output correctly to extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(output)
```

By changing the arguments passed to `Popen` and properly handling the output to extract the version number, the corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
