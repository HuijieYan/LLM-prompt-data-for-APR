The buggy function "info" in fish.py is causing a recursive loop when the oh-my-fish plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. The issue is triggered because the function is trying to get the version of the fish shell by running the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" using the Popen subprocess. This causes the recursive loop and hangs the Fish Shell initialisation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to directly access the FISH_VERSION environment variable without creating a subprocess. This will prevent the recursive loop and resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By directly accessing the FISH_VERSION environment variable, we avoid creating a subprocess and prevent the recursive loop from occurring. This corrected version of the function satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
