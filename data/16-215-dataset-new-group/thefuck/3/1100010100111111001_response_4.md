The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly reading the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` function is not returning the expected version number '3.5.9', but rather 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract the version number '3.5.9' from the output of the command and return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
