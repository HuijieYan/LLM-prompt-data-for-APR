1. The buggy function is the `info` function in the `Fish` class. The test code provided shows that the `shell.info()` call does not produce the expected output, resulting in an assertion error. The error message indicates that the problem lies in the output format of the string returned by `shell.info()`. The GitHub issue suggests that this bug is related to recursive loop triggered by the `-v` option in the context of the Oh-My-Fish plugin with the `thefuck` component.

2. The potential error location is in the line where the `version` is obtained from the command output. The issue is likely due to the command output not matching the expected format.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `shell.info()` function returns an unexpected format for the Fish shell version due to a recursive loop. The provided test expects the version in the format `"Fish Shell 3.5.9"`, while the buggy implementation returns the format `"Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9"`. This inconsistency causes the assertion error.

4. To fix the bug, the `shell.info()` function should be updated to properly parse and format the version obtained from the command output and remove the triggering of recursive loops.

5. Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Parse the version to extract only the version number
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this corrected version, the function will properly obtain the Fish shell version and format it as `"Fish Shell <version>"`, which should satisfy the test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
