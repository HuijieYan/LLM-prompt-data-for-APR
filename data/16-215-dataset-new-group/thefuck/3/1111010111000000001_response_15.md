The issue here is that the Popen call in the info method is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of the Fish shell, but the test is expecting the command to be 'fish --version'.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to change the Popen call to use the command 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected version of the info function:

```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
