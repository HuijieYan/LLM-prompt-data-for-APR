## Analysis
The `info` function uses `Popen` to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, it's using the wrong command to get the version, which is causing the test to fail.

## Error Locations
1. The command being executed using `Popen` is incorrect.
2. The expected output in the test is also incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused because the command to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, and the test is expecting a different output than what the `info` function is providing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `Popen` command should be changed to execute `fish --version` to correctly retrieve the version. Also, the expected output in the test should be updated to match the correct output.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))

# The updated test function that the corrected function should pass
    def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
        assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
        assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
