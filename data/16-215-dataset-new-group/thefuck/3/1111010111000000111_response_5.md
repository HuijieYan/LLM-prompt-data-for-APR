The identified potential error location within the buggy function is the Popen call, as well as the way the version is being extracted and formatted.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong arguments, and the version extraction and formatting is not in line with the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen call to use the correct arguments and then extract and format the version correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected function, it should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
