The issue seems to be related to the use of the `thefuck -v` command in the Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing a recursive loop due to the `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()` function.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The usage of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop.
2. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line may not be capturing the correct output.

The cause of the bug is the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin. Additionally, the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line may not be correctly capturing the version information.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `thefuck -v` command does not trigger a recursive loop and ensure that the correct version information is retrieved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'env'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        env_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')
        version = None
        for line in env_output.split('\n'):
            if line.startswith('FISH_VERSION='):
                version = line.split('=')[1]
                break
        if version:
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return 'Fish Shell (unknown version)'
```

In this corrected version, we use the `env` command to retrieve the environment information and then parse the output to find the `FISH_VERSION` variable, capturing its value as the version of Fish Shell. This should prevent the recursive loop and correctly retrieve the version information.
