## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of the expected 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

## Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command. The function currently returns the entire string 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of extracting only the version number.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the version number from the output of the command and format it as the return value.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[-1]  # Get the last part of the version string
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
