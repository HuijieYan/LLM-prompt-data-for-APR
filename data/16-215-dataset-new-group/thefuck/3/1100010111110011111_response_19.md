## The cause of the bug:

The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current implementation in the `info` function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which does not provide the correct version information. This causes the failing test to compare the incorrect output with the expected value.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

The buggy function needs to be fixed to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version. To achieve this, the command used to retrieve the version needs to be updated to `fish --version` which will provide the correct version information.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command, and the failing test should pass as it compares the correct output with the expected value.
