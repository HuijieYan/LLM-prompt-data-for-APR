Given the analysis of the buggy function, the issue on GitHub, the failing test, and the runtime and expected input/output values, it seems like the cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not fetching the correct version information from the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable. The failing test also indicates that the information displayed in the error message is not what was expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to fetch the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable and then properly format and return the version information.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, `Popen` is called with `shell=True` to allow the command to be run through the shell, thus enabling the environment variable expansion. Then, the `communicate` method is used to fetch the output of the command.

By making these changes, the `info` function should now properly retrieve the version information from the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable and return the expected output. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
