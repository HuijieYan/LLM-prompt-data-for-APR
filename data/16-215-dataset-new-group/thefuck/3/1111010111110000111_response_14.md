The problem with the given function is that it's trying to fetch the Fish shell version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the failing test indicates that the output of this command is `fish, version 3.5.9`, and the function is trying to format it as `Fish Shell 3.5.9`, resulting in an assertion error.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to correctly parse and format the version output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly parse the version output and return the string in the expected format. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test passes.
