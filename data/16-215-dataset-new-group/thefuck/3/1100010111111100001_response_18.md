The issue in the buggy function is that it is incorrectly using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This is causing the returned value to be in the format "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just "3.5.9", causing the test to fail. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are using the command `fish --version` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and then extracting just the version number from the returned string. This ensures that the returned value aligns with the expected value in the test, fixing the bug.
