## The source code of the corrected function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

By modifying the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to `version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()` and `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` to `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])`, we can fix the bug.

The bug in the original code was caused by using `proc.stdout.read()` which reads the entire output of the command, including the text "fish, version" which was not being handled correctly. By changing it to `proc.stdout.readline()`, we read only a single line of output, and then by using `version.split(', version ')[1]` we extract only the version number without the preceding text.

This change will fix the bug and the corrected function will pass the failing test.

The corrected function will now have the following source code:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```
