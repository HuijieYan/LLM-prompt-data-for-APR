## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function:
1. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` used in `Popen` might not return the correct version of the Fish shell.
2. The reading of the stdout from the process might not be handled correctly.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used in `Popen` and the incorrect reading of the stdout. This causes the function to return an incorrect version.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in `Popen` to get the correct version of the Fish shell. Additionally, we need to ensure that the output obtained from the process is handled correctly to get the correct version.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
