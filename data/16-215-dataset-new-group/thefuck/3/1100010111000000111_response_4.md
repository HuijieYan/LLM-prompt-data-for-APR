## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the original buggy function, the call to Popen uses the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the failing test expects the command 'fish --version' to be used.

To fix the bug, the command used in the Popen call should be changed to 'fish --version' in order to properly capture the version of the Fish shell.

The corrected version of the buggy function above resolves the issue and should pass the failing test.
