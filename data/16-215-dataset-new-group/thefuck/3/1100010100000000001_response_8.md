The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
1. The use of `stdout.read()` without checking for the process completion, which may result in incomplete data being read.
2. Unclear exception handling if the `Popen` process fails.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function may not handle the `Popen` process properly and might result in incomplete or incorrect data being read from the process output.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to complete and then returns a tuple containing the stdout and stderr data. We can also add exception handling for the `Popen` process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The fixed version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error: Unable to retrieve shell information - " + str(e)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method to get the stdout data and handle any exceptions that may occur during the `Popen` process. This ensures that the function properly captures the version of the Fish shell and handles errors gracefully.
