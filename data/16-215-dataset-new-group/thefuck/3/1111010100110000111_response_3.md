## The analysis of the buggy function

The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting the output. However, when the `info` function is tested, it fails with an assertion error because the output format does not match the expected format.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The GitHub issue further explains that using the `thefuck -v` command in Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to an issue with the `Fish.info()` function.

## Identification of potential error locations

The potential error in the `info` function could be caused by the way the command output is being formatted and parsed. It seems that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is returning an unexpected format, causing the failure in the test.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `info` function is due to the fact that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command returns additional unwanted text, leading to the output format mismatch. This mismatch is causing the assertion error in the test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way that the command output is handled and parsed in the `info` function. We should retrieve only the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command and format it correctly to match the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is split by the comma, and the second part is extracted as the version number. This version number is then formatted correctly to match the expected output, `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
