The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell. It is using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" to capture the version, but it is not returning the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" does not return the version information in the expected format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to capture the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function captures the version of the Fish shell using the "fish --version" command, which returns the version information in the expected format. This should satisfy the expected input/output values.
