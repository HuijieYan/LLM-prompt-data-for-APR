The buggy function is the "info" function from the "fish.py" file in the thefuck/shells folder. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the Popen function to execute a command in the fish shell and retrieve the version.

The bug seems to be related to the command being executed and the parsing of the output. The "echo $FISH_VERSION" command may not be providing the expected output, leading to incorrect version retrieval.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed and adjust the parsing of the output to ensure the correct version is being retrieved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are now executing the "fish -v" command to directly retrieve the Fish Shell version. The output parsing remains the same, as we are still expecting the version to be the only content in the output.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub link and correctly retrieve the Fish Shell version.
