## The bug analysis
1. The buggy function `info` in `shells/fish.py` is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test fails with an assertion error because the output is not as expected.
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the command being executed and the parsing of the output to extract the version number.
3. The cause of the bug is that the command being executed does not match the expected command in the test, leading to a mismatch in the output. This causes the assertion error when comparing the expected and actual version numbers.
4. To fix the bug, the command being executed in the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to ensure consistency with the expected command in the test. Additionally, the output parsing should be modified to extract the version number correctly.
5. Based on the analysis, a corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
