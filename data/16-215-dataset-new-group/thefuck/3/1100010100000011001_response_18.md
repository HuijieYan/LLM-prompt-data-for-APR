The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly reading the output of the Popen process to get the version of the Fish shell. This is because `proc.stdout.read()` is not being properly handled.

To fix the bug, the function should use `communicate()` to read the output of the Popen process and decode it properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version of the function utilizes the `communicate()` method on the `proc` object to get the stdout and stderr outputs of the Popen process. It then properly decodes the stdout output to get the version of the Fish shell and returns the formatted string with the version.
