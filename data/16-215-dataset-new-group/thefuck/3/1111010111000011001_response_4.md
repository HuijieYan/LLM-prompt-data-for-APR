To fix the buggy function, we need to correct the command used to get the Fish shell version and make sure the function returns the expected version string.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the Fish shell version is incorrect, and the function is not returning the expected version string.

To fix the bug, we should modify the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' and decode the output to get the correct version string.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly return the Fish shell version as expected and pass the failing test.
