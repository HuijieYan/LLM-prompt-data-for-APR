### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `info` function in the `fish.py` file within the `thefuck` project. The function calls the `Popen` function to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` but does not wait for the process to complete before trying to read from its output. This can potentially cause the function to hang, especially in cases where the `thefuck` plugin is being used in conjunction with Oh-My-Fish, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Popen` process completes before trying to read from its output. This can be achieved by using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to complete and then return the output. We also need to handle any potential errors that may occur during the process execution.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to complete and get the output
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
