Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, text=True)
    version = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it does not handle the decoding of the stdout properly. The `Popen` function should be given the `text=True` argument to ensure that the stdout is decoded as text.

By providing the `text=True` argument to the `Popen` function, we can ensure that the stdout is read as text and the decoding is handled automatically.

Now, the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
