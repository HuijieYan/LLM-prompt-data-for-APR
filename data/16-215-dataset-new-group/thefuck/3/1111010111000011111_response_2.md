The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is causing a recursive loop issue in the `thefuck` plugin when using Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The `info` function is supposed to return the name of the current shell along with its version, but it currently triggers a recursive loop due to the way it retrieves the shell version.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the shell version, which is leading to the recursive loop in certain environments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the shell version is retrieved in the `info` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell, which should not trigger the recursive loop issue. 

By using `['fish', '--version']` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, we can avoid the recursive loop and retrieve the shell version in a more reliable manner.

This corrected version of the `info` function should satisfy the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
