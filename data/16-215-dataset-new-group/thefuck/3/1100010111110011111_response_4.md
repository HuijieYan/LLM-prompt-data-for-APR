## Analysis
The `info` function is using the `-c` option in the `Popen` command to execute a fish shell command to get the version number. However, the command being used is `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This causes the returned version to be in the wrong format, leading to the failing test.

## Bug
The bug in the `info` function is caused by using the incorrect command to retrieve the fish shell version. The returned version is not in the expected format, causing the failing test.

## Suggested Fix
Replace the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` with `fish --version` in the `Popen` command to get the correct fish shell version in the expected format.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
