The bug in the `info` function is that it is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` module, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`. This is why the test is failing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
