The buggy function is the `info` function in the `fish.py` file. The function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. However, there are several issues in the function that cause it to fail.

1. The command executed does not match the command expected in the test. The command in the test is `['fish', '--version']` while the function executes `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This mismatch causes the produced output to be incorrect.

2. The function reads the output from the process using `proc.stdout.read()` without properly handling the side effects caused by mock objects in the test. This leads to incorrect output being returned.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to execute the correct command, `['fish', '--version']`, and process the output to retrieve the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[-1].strip()  # Extract the version from the output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
