To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The `Popen` call is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is expecting the command `['fish', '--version']`.
2. The function is not decoding the output of the `Popen` call correctly.

To fix the bug, we should update the `Popen` call to use the correct command and ensure that the output is decoded properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `Popen` call correctly and return the expected version value.
