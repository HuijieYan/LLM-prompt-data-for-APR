The bug in the `info` function is caused by using the wrong command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) to retrieve the version of the fish shell. Additionally, the test is expecting the version number in a different format (`fish, version 3.5.9` instead of just `3.5.9`).

To fix the bug, we need to update the command to retrieve the version and format the version number accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the function should correctly retrieve the version number of the fish shell and format it according to the expected output format.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and return the expected output: `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
