## Correction of the buggy function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Explanation:
1. The original function uses the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" to get the Fish shell version, but the test is expecting the command "--version" to be used instead.
2. The test is setting the return value of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to "fish, version 3.5.9", which is different from the current implementation.
3. The GitHub issue also mentions the use of the wrong command triggering a recursive loop, which indicates that the command used in the original function is incorrect.
4. By changing the command to ['fish', '--version'], we can align the function with the expectations of the failing test as well as resolve the issue mentioned in GitHub.
