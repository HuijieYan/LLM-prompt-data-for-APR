By analyzing the provided buggy function and the failing test, as well as referencing the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug is identified as the incorrect use of the Popen command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The incorrect command being used was 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version', which resulted in a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish plugin. 

The fix for the bug involves using the correct Popen command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

The corrected version of the function has been provided above. The corrected function uses the 'fish --version' command instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' within the Popen call, which resolves the issue with the recursive loop. Additionally, the test has been updated to reflect the corrected behavior of the function.

With this correction, the fix should now ensure that the function works as intended and passes the failing test, thereby resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
