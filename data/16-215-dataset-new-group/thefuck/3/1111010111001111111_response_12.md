Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue is with the command used to get the fish version in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The `Popen` command is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the fish version, but it should be using `fish --version` instead.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the fish version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
