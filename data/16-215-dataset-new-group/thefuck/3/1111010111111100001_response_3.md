The issue in the `info` function is that it is attempting to fetch the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` but the test is providing the version in a different format, such as `fish, version 3.5.9\n`. This causes the assertion error because the expected output doesn't match the actual output due to the different formats.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract the version number from the provided output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8')
        version = output.split(', version ')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell.

Make sure to update the test to provide the expected output in the new format as well.
