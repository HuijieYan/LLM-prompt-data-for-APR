## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of `fish.py` is using the `Popen` function to execute a command and capture the stdout. It seems that the function is not handling the subprocess correctly, which might be causing the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Location
The issue is likely located in the way the subprocess is being handled. Specifically, the usage of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to capture the output might be causing the problem.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the subprocess, leading to a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the subprocess handling needs to be corrected to avoid the recursive loop and ensure that the function `info` works as intended.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        except Exception:
            version = 'Unknown'
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
