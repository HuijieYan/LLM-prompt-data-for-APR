To fix the buggy function, we need to modify the `info` function in the `Fish` class to correctly get the version of the fish shell and format it into the expected output.

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version.replace("fish, version ", "")}'
```

In the corrected version, we use `['fish', '--version']` to get the version of the fish shell, and then remove the extra text to just leave the version number. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions.
