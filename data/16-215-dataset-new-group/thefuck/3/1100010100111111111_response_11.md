The bug in the `info` function causing the failing test is that the function is not reading the correct version string from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The expected value for the `version` variable is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the actual value is `'3.5.9'`.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not returning the expected string format. The test is failing because the function is not formatting the version string correctly before returning it.

To fix the bug, the function needs to capture and format the version string correctly before returning it. The correct command to capture the version string is `fish --version`, which returns the version string in the format `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. Then, the function needs to extract the version part and format the return string as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_string = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_string.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly capture and format the Fish Shell version string and return the expected value, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
