The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test is set up to mock the output of the `Popen` call to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the `info` function is expecting only the version number without the extra text.

The error message from the failing test shows that the actual output of the `info` function contains the extra text `fish,` which causes the assertion to fail.

To fix this bug, the `info` function needs to extract only the version number from the output of the `Popen` call and return it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are using `['fish', '--version']` to get the version information directly instead of using the environment variable `FISH_VERSION`. We also split the output to extract only the version number.

With this corrected function, the test `assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` should pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
