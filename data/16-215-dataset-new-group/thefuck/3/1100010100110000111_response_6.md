The buggy function `info` in the file `thefuck/shells/fish.py` is trying to get the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command and capturing its output. The error message indicates that the output of the command includes the word "fish," which is not part of the version number expected by the test.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect parsing of the shell version from the command output. The error message and the failing test confirm that the function is not correctly extracting the version number from the command output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the parsing logic to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version number from the command output and pass the failing test.
