The issue with the `info` function is that it directly returns the version string without properly formatting it as 'Fish Shell version'. This results in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly format the version string before returning it. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this correction, the function now filters out the unnecessary prefix 'fish, version ' from the version string and properly formats it as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
