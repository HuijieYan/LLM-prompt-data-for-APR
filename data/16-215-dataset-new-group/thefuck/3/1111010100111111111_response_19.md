There are couple of issues in the given code which cause the incorrect output. The `info` function is not reading the correct version of the shell and it's not formatting the output correctly. Here's the corrected and updated version of the `Fish` class with the `info` function fixed.

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

In the updated version:
- The command `fish --version` is used instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the shell version.
- The output of `proc.stdout.read()` is split and the last part (which contains the version number) is used to format the output.

This should fix the issue reported in the failing test and also addresses the GitHub issue related to oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11.
