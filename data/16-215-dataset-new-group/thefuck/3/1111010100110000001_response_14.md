The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is attempting to extract the version of the Fish shell by using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module. The `Popen` function is used to open a pipe to/from a command and read its output. However, the buggy function seems to be reading the version of the Fish shell incorrectly, resulting in the wrong output.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` object is not being used correctly to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function directly reads from `proc.stdout` without considering the side effects, resulting in the incorrect output of the shell version that is not properly parsed.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the side effects of the `Popen` object and properly format the shell version string before returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `Popen` object reads the version output as bytes and then properly decodes it to a string. It uses the `split` method to extract the version from the output before returning the formatted shell version string.
