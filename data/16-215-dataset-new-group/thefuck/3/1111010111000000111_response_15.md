The potential error in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is the command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell. It currently uses `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is incorrect. In addition, the test function `test_info` is setting up the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the actual command in the `info` function is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which does not match the input.

The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell in the `info` function, and the mismatch in the test setup and actual command in the `info` function.

To fix the bug,
1. Use the correct command to retrieve the version of the fish shell. The correct command is `fish --version`.
2. Update the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` in the `test_info` function to match the correct output of `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

The corrected version of the `test_info` function:

```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these corrections, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the version of the fish shell, and the test should pass.
