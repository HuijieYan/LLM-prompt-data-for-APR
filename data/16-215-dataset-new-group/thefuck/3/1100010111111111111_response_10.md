The bug in the `info` function of the Fish shell is caused by the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is using `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to retrieve the version, but the expected version is `fish, version 3.5.9`.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be updated to use `fish --version` to retrieve the correct version information.

Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
