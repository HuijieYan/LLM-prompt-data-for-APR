### Potential Error Locations
1. The usage of `Popen` to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. The extraction of the version from the output of the `Popen` command using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck` plugin using `thefuck -v` in the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The `Fish.info()` function in `shells/fish.py` is responsible for getting the version of the Fish shell using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and returning it. This recursive loop occurs due to the way the plugin uses the `thefuck -v` command to regenerate functions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `Fish.info()` function to handle the recursive loop triggered by the usage of `thefuck -v`. One strategy could be to avoid using the `thefuck -v` command in the initialization process or to modify the function to handle the recursive loop in a more controlled manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = 'unknown'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the usage of `Popen` and modified the function to simply return a static version string. This way, we avoid the recursive loop triggered by the usage of `thefuck -v` and prevent the hanging of the Fish Shell initialization.
