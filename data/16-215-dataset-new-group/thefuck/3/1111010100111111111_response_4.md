## The Bug
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is currently not working as expected. The runtime input/output and expected input/output values are not matching, resulting in a failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the output from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and formatting it into the expected string.

## Fix Strategy
The fix for the bug involves correctly parsing the output from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and formatting it into the expected string.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[-1])
```

This corrected version handles the parsing of the version from the output of the command and formats it into the expected string. This should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
