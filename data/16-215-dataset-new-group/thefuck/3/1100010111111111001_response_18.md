The problem in the provided `info` function seems to be how it retrieves the version of the Fish shell. When using the Popen function to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, it seems that it retrieves the version in a different format than expected.

It's clear from the failing test that the version returned is in the format "fish, version 3.5.9" but the expected format is just "3.5.9".

To fix this issue, the `info` function needs to be modified to extract the version in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are running the command `fish --version` to explicitly get the version in the correct format. Then, we extract the version from the response using `split` and return it in the desired format.
