The cause of the bug is that `Popen.stdout.read()` is being treated as a function call, rather than a property, which is causing the function to hang. This is likely the reason for the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to replace `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` with `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` in the `info` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
