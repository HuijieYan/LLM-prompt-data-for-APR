The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the incorrect formatting of the version string. The current implementation only slices the version number from the output of the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but it should be formatting the entire output string which contains the shell name as well.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to format the output string correctly and include the shell name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(output)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
