The bug in the `info` function is caused by the way the output of the `Popen` command is being processed. The function is currently returning the entire output from the `Popen` command, which includes the word "fish, version" along with the actual version number. This causes the assertion to fail, as the expected version string is different from the actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the output of the `Popen` command is processed to extract the version number correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # extract version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function should correctly extract the version number and return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' when called, resolving the failing test and the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
