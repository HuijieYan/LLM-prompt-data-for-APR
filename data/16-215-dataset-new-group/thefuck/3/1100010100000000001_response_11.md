The potential error in the provided function is that the `Popen` object is not being waited for completion before reading from its `stdout`. The function attempts to read the `stdout` immediately after starting the process, which may result in the process not having completed yet. 

To fix this issue, a strategy would be to wait for the `Popen` object to complete before reading from its `stdout`. This can be achieved using the `communicate()` method, which waits for the process to complete and returns a tuple containing the `stdout` and `stderr` outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `communicate()` method is used to wait for the process to complete and obtain the `stdout` output. This ensures that the function reads the version after the process has finished executing.
