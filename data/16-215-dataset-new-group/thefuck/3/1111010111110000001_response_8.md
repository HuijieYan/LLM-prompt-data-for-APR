The issue in the `info` function arises from using the wrong command to fetch the version. The `Popen` call is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to determine the version, whereas the test is expecting `'fish --version'`. This results in the mismatch between the actual and expected version strings.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be changed to use the correct command to fetch the version `'fish --version'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function will return the version in the expected format, and the test should pass successfully.
