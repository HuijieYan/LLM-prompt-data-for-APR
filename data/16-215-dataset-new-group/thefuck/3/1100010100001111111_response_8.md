The bug occurs because the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the Fish version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` method. However, it doesn't handle the process communication properly, which causes the function to hang and trigger a recursive loop.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the process communication and ensure that it doesn't trigger a recursive loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `communicate` method is used to properly read the output of the subprocess. This should prevent the recursive loop and correctly return the Fish version.
