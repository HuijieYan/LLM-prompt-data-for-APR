The buggy function `info` is attempting to extract the version of the Fish shell, but it's not handling the output correctly. The error message indicates that the output is being formatted in a way that is unexpected, resulting in a failed assertion.

The cause of the bug is that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is outputting the version with additional text, causing the formatting to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the shell version from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", ")[1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The correction involves splitting the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION` by the comma and space and extracting the second part of the split, which contains the version number. With this correction, the function should now be able to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
