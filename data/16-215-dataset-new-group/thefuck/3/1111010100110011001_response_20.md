## The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the fact that the `info` function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The version number is being extracted as `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command, and then format it into the string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

## The corrected version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
