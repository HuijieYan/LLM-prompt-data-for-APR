## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The usage of Popen to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'
2. Reading the stdout of the Popen process without waiting for it to finish
3. The way the version is extracted from the stdout of the process
4. The way the version is formatted in the return statement

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered by the usage of the 'thefuck -v' command in the Oh-My-Fish plugin, which calls the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The `info` function then executes the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' using Popen, but it does not wait for the process to finish and read the stdout directly, leading to a recursive loop.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Wait for the Popen process to finish before reading its output
2. Ensure the function does not get called recursively when the 'thefuck -v' command is executed
3. Format the version information correctly

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    @cache
    def version(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return version

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if '-v' in sys.argv:
            return
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(self.version())
```
