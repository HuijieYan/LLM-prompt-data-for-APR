The bug in the given function is that it is attempting to read from the `proc.stdout` using `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to incomplete or empty output.

To fix this bug, you can use the `proc.communicate()` method on the `Popen` object to wait for the process to finish and fetch the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()`, we ensure that the function waits for the process to finish and fetches the output correctly.

This fix addresses the issue of incomplete or missing output from the subprocess, ensuring that the version variable is populated with the correct value before it is returned.
