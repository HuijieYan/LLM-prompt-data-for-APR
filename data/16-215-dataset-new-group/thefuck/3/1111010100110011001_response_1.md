The cause of the bug in the `info` function is that it is reading the entire output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command, including the "fish, version" text, and then trying to format it as "Fish Shell {version}". This results in the unexpected output "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to extract the version number from the output and then format it as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will extract only the version number from the output and format it correctly as "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
