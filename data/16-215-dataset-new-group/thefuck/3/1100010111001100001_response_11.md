The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell. The function is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version' to get the shell version.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command that is passed to Popen to retrieve the shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
