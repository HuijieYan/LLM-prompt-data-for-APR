## Analysis
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, Fish Shell. However, the function does not correctly parse the version number, leading to a failure in the test and causing a recursive loop with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

## Error Locations
1. The way the version number is extracted from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command seems to be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version number from the output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This causes the returned value to be "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just the version number, triggering the assertion error in the test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the output of the command to extract only the version number and remove any extra characters.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `replace` method is used to remove the unnecessary prefix "fish, version" from the version number, ensuring that only the version number is returned. This fix should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
