The issue with the buggy function is that it is not running the correct command to get the Fish shell version. Additionally, it is not reading the output of the command in the correct format, resulting in an incorrect version string.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command is using the wrong argument to get the Fish shell version, and the assertion in the test is failing because the version string returned by the function does not match the expected value.

To fix the bug, the Popen command should be updated to use the correct argument to get the Fish shell version, and the code to read the output of the command should be modified to get the correct version string in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly obtain the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format. This should fix the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
