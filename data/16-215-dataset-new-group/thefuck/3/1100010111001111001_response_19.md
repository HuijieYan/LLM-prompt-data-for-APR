The cause of the bug in the `info` function is that it is trying to read the Fish shell version using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" instead of "fish --version". This is causing the Popen call to not return the expected output, leading to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the Popen call to use "fish --version" to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should now pass.
