The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. It is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to change the command executed by `Popen` from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the `test_info` function should now pass, as it is expecting the output from `['fish', '--version']` and not `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
