## Fixing the bug

### Cause of the bug:
The bug originates from the method `info()` in the `Fish` class. The method is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by running a subprocess with the command "echo $FISH_VERSION". However, the method is reading the output incorrectly and not using the correct command to get the version.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `info()` method should be modified to properly capture the version information by using the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version.

### The corrected version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `Popen` command is updated to use `['fish', '--version']` as the argument to properly retrieve the Fish Shell version. The stdout is then read, decoded, and split to extract the version information correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values while also resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
