The issue with the given function is that it calls the 'fish' command with the '-c' flag and 'echo $FISH_VERSION' argument to get the version, while the test is expecting the version to be obtained using 'fish' command with the '--version' argument. Additionally, the return value needs to be parsed to extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function calls the 'fish' command with the '--version' argument to get the version and then parses the version number from the output. With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
