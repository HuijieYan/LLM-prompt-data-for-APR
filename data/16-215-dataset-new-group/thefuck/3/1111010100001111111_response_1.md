To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The issue seems to be related to the command used to retrieve the version, causing a recursive loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command to retrieve the Fish shell version has been changed to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This should properly retrieve the version without causing a recursive loop, fixing the issue reported on GitHub.
