## Fixing the bug

The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is trying to get the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it's not fetching the correct value. The failing test expects the output to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but it is getting 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed by `Popen` to fetch the correct version of Fish shell.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `--version` flag instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the command. Also, we are splitting the output by `,` and taking the second part to get the version number. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
