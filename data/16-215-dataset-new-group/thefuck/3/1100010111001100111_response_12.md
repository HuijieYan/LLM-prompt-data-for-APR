## The analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, there are several issues with the function:
1. It is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version`.
2. The function is not handling the case where the `Popen` call fails.

## The cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is using the incorrect command to get the Fish shell version and it is not handling the `Popen` call failure. This is causing the failing test and the GitHub issue related to a recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by using the correct command to get the Fish shell version (`fish --version`) and handling any failure that occurs during the `Popen` call.

## The corrected version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
    except Exception:
        return 'Fish Shell version not found'
```

With this corrected version, the function will use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and handle any failures that occur during the `Popen` call. This should resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop.
