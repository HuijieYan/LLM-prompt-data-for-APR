The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to retrieve the version of the fish shell using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test is expecting the version to be obtained by the command 'fish --version', resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual version strings.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to retrieve the version using the correct command, 'fish --version'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
