The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Not handling the case when the Popen process fails to execute.
2. Using DEVNULL without importing it.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle exceptions that may occur during the Popen process execution, and DEVNULL is used without importing it from the subprocess module.

To fix the bug:
- Import DEVNULL from subprocess module.
- Use try-except block to handle exceptions from the Popen process execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from ..utils import cache

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error getting shell information: {}".format(str(e))
```

In the corrected version:
- DEVNULL is imported from the subprocess module.
- A try-except block is used to handle exceptions from the Popen process execution.
- The communicate() method is used to read the output from the process.
