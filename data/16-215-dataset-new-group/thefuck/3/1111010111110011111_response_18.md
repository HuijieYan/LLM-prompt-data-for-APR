The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is not capturing the correct version string from the output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The function is currently returning a string that includes both the shell name and version separated by a comma.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `info` function to extract only the version string from the output of the command and return it in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # extract the version string
        version = version.split(' ')[-1]  # select the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test by extracting and returning only the version string from the output.
