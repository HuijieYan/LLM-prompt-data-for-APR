The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to how the `Popen` object is being used to retrieve the output. The `read` method of `proc.stdout` is being mocked, which may not be returning the actual output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to properly retrieve the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of accessing `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the actual output of the command is captured correctly, avoiding potential issues caused by mocking the `read` method.
