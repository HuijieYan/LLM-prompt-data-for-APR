The potential error in the buggy function is the use of the incorrect command to get the Fish shell version, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the original code uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the Fish shell version, but the test case expects 'fish, version x.x.x'. This causes the test case to fail as the output does not match the expected value.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version, which is 'fish --version'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
With the corrected version, the function will use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and properly format the output. This will resolve the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values, effectively fixing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
