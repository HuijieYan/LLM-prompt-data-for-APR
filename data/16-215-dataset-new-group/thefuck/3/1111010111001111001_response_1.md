```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The buggy function is trying to extract the fish shell version by executing the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the failing test is expecting the shell version to be extracted using the command 'fish --version'.
So, the cause of the bug is that the command to extract the shell version is different in the function compared to the expected command in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function should use the command 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

The corrected version of the function is provided above, which should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
