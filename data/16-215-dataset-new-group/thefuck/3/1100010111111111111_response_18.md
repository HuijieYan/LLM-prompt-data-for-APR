The issue is that the `info` function is trying to retrieve the version string using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION", but the actual version string returned is "fish, version 3.5.9" which is not compatible with the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command to retrieve the correct version string and format it accordingly. Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrects the bug by modifying the command to retrieve the version string and extracting just the version number from the returned string. This should resolve the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
