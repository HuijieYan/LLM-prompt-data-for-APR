There are several issues present in the given buggy function. 

1. The function  info(self) is not properly defining the Popen() function, which is used to execute a command in a subshell.

2. The function is not capturing the correct output and formatting it properly.

3. There is a recursive loop issue as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug:
The Popen function is not being called correctly, and the stdout is not being read and formatted properly, resulting in incorrect output. Additionally, the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue is likely due to the misconfiguration of the Popen function.

Fix strategy:
1. Properly define the Popen() function to execute the command to obtain the Fish shell version.
2. Read the output from stdout and format it correctly to obtain the shell version information.
3. Make sure to handle the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)  # Properly define Popen
    version = proc.communicate()[0]  # Read the output from stdout
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')  # Format the version information
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have properly defined the Popen function and read the output from stdout using the `communicate()` method. We have also formatted the version information by removing the unnecessary prefix. This should resolve the issue and provide the expected output. Additionally, the recursive loop issue should also be resolved by properly configuring the Popen function.
