The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of the `thefuck.shells.fish` file is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using the `Popen` function, and then formatting and returning the version number as `"Fish Shell {version}"`. 

The failing test indicates that the expected output is `"Fish Shell 3.5.9"`, but the function is returning `"Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9"`. This suggests that the version output from the command includes the preceding text "fish, version" which is not expected.

The runtime values and types show that the value of `version` includes the text "fish, version" which is not desired. 

The GitHub issue explains that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop in the `Fish.info()` function, which is likely causing the unexpected output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the shell version is retrieved from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, after decoding the command output, the `split(', ')[1]` is used to extract only the version number without the preceding text "fish, version".

After applying this fix, the `info` function should return the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9" and resolve the failing test, as well as address the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop.
