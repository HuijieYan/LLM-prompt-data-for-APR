## Proposed fix:

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is only capturing the version number from the output, while the expected output includes the string "fish, version" as well. This causes the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix this, we need to modify the `info` function to capture the entire version string including "fish, version".

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# Corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the command to `'fish --version'`, we ensure that the entire version string including "fish, version" is captured and returned by the `info` function.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
