## The bug

The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the Fish shell version by running a command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module. However, the test is failing because the function is returning a string that includes unnecessary characters and text.

## Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version in the `info` function (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) does not match the command used to set up the test check (`fish, version 3.5.9`).

## Strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the command used to retrieve the version in the `info` function in such a way that it matches the expected standard output for the test case.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.decode('utf-8').strip())
```

The corrected version of the function uses `'fish', '--version'` as the command to retrieve the version to match the expected standard output for the test case. It also correctly decodes the output to get the version string and returns the formatted shell name and version.
