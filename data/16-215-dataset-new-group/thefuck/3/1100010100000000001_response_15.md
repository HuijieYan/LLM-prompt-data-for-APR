1. The function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is currently not handling the possible errors that may occur when running the Popen command to retrieve the version.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   a. The Popen command may encounter errors that are not being handled.
   b. The `read()` method may hang if the process does not complete.
   c. The function does not handle exceptions gracefully.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle potential errors that may occur when trying to get the version of the shell. This can lead to unexpected behaviors or crashes when running the function.

4. To fix the bug, error handling should be added to handle any exceptions that may occur during the Popen command, and the use of `communicate()` is the recommended strategy for securely reading both `stdout` and `stderr` without risk of blocking. This will ensure that any errors are properly handled and the function returns the expected result.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            raise Exception("Error retrieving Fish shell version")
        
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error: {}".format(str(e))
```
In the corrected version, we added error handling using a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the Popen command. We also used `communicate()` to securely read both `stdout` and `stderr`, and checked the return code to handle errors properly. If an error occurs, the function will return an error message instead of crashing.
