To fix the buggy function, we need to update the command used to fetch the Fish shell version and modify the way we parse the version from the command output.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to fetch the Fish shell version is incorrect, and the way the output is parsed is also incorrect. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen command to use the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version and then parse the output to extract the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly fetch and parse the Fish shell version, and the failing test should pass. This will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect command.
