The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and reading the result from the standard output of the process. However, the function is not correctly parsing the version from the output of the command, causing the test to fail with an assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the command output includes additional text (`fish, version`) which is not required and is not being accounted for in the function. This leads to a mismatch in the version extracted from the output and the expected version.

To fix the bug, the function should use string manipulation or regular expressions to extract just the version number from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', version)  # Using regex to extract version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.group(0))
```

With this fix, the function should correctly extract the version number from the command output, and the test should pass without any assertion errors.
