```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The bug in the original function is that it is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to try to get the version of the fish shell, but the test is expecting 'fish --version' to be used. This leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

The corrected version of the function fixes this issue by using the correct command 'fish --version' to get the version of the fish shell. With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
