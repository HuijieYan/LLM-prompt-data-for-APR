The issue with the `info` function in shells/fish.py is that it is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell and returning the incorrect string. The failing test is expecting the version number to be extracted from the output of the `fish -v` command, but the function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is not providing the right version.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the `fish -v` command to get the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version number of the Fish shell using the `fish -v` command and return the expected output.
