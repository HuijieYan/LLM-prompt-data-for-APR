# Let's analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, the runtime/input output values, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue:
The buggy function, `info`, is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` method to execute a command that retrieves the Fish shell version, and then formats it into a string. The failing test provides the expected behavior, where the function should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' when the `Popen` function returns 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

The runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function show that the `Popen` function is mocked, and the `version` variable is a string representing the shell version. The expected values and types align with the runtime values and types.

The GitHub issue indicates that the `thefuck -v` command hangs the Fish shell initialization due to recursive loop triggered by `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()`.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error lies in the command being executed using `Popen` and the reading of its output.

## Explaining the cause of the bug:
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which may not be returning the expected output.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to update the command being executed using `Popen` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

## Providing a corrected version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```
In the corrected version, we have updated the command to `['fish', '--version']`, which should return the proper version information. Additionally, we modify the `version` variable by removing the unnecessary 'fish, version ' substring, and then format it into a string.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now properly retrieve and format the Fish shell version, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
