The bug in the given function is that it is trying to get the fish version using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command 'fish --version'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to get the fish version in the info function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
