## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The original function is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of the Fish shell, which is not the correct command. The correct command should be 'fish --version'. Additionally, the call to Popen should include the '--version' argument, which was missing in the original code, causing the test to fail.

The corrected version of the function uses the correct command and passes the '--version' argument to Popen, ensuring that the version is captured correctly and the test passes.
