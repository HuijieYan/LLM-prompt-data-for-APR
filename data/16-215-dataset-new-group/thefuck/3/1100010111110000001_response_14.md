The bug occurs in the `info` function, which calls the `Popen` method with `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. The expected version is '3.5.9', but the actual version returned is 'fish, version 3.5.9'. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to ensure that it retrieves the correct version of the Fish shell and removes any additional text.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    _, version = version.split(" ", 1)  # Split by space and take the second part
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This modified version of the `info` function should successfully pass the failing test and return the correct version of the Fish shell, fixing the bug.
