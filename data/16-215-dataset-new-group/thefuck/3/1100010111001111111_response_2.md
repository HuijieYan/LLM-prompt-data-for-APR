Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue with the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is related to the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version and how it's causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the Fish Shell version using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the expected input/output values in the failing test suggest that the correct command should be `['fish', '--version']`. This discrepancy is likely causing the function to return the incorrect version string and leading to the failing test case.

To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` call should be updated to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub. Additionally, the function can be modified to use the correct command and format the version string accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number from "fish, version x.x.x"
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now return the correct Fish Shell version and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
