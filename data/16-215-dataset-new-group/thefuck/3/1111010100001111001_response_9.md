The buggy function has an issue where it is not reading the correct output from the process. This is likely due to not waiting for the process to finish before reading its output.

To fix this, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to finish and then return the output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should now properly capture the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and return the expected result.
