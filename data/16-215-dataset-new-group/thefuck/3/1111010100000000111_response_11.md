Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function is within the `Fish` class and is called `info`. It is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the fish shell and capturing the version number from the output. However, the reported issue on GitHub indicates that using the plugin with the `-v` flag triggers a recursive loop, which suggests that the function is not handling the `-v` flag properly.

Identified Potential Error Locations:
The potential error location within the buggy function is the command execution using Popen and how the output is handled.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing a recursive loop because the function is not handling the '-v' flag properly. When the plugin uses the `-v` flag to check for the regeneration of functions, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way the `info` function is implemented.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to handle the `-v` flag properly. This may involve checking if the `-v` flag is present and responding accordingly.

Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if '-v' in sys.argv:
            return "Fish Shell"
        else:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
