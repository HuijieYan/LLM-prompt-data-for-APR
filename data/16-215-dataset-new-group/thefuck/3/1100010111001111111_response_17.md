Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the original buggy function, the command to retrieve the fish shell version was incorrect. The function was using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` to get the version information. This caused the function to return incorrect values, leading to failed tests.

The corrected version uses the proper command `fish --version` to retrieve the version information, which aligns with the expected input/output values from the failing test case. This will fix the issue reported in GitHub and make the function return the expected values.

With the corrected version, the function should return the expected output:
```python
'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
```
