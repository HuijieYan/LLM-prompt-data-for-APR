The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then reading the output. However, this approach causes a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, as reported in the GitHub issue. The recursive loop occurs because the `info` function is called by the TheFuck plugin, causing it to hang during Fish Shell initialization.

To fix this bug, one potential strategy is to directly access the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable instead of running a command to retrieve it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By directly accessing the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, we avoid the recursive loop issue and ensure that the function returns the correct version of the Fish shell.
