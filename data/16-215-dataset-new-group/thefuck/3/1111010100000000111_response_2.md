The bug in the code is caused by a recursive loop when the function info() is called with the -v flag, which triggers the regeneration of functions and leads to an infinite loop.

To fix this bug, we can modify the info() function to check for the -v flag and return the shell name and version without triggering the regeneration of functions in the shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv:
        return "Fish Shell"
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we check if the -v flag is present in the command line arguments using sys.argv. If it is present, we return the shell name without triggering any functions regeneration. Otherwise, we proceed with retrieving the version of the Fish shell and returning it. This should resolve the infinite loop issue as reported in the GitHub issue.
