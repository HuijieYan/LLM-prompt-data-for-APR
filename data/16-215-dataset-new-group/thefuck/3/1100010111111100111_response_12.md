The issue with the buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is that it tries to get the version of Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the failing test expects the command `fish --version` to be used.

The failing test `test_info` in `test_fish.py` provides a mock response for the command `fish --version` as `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which the `info` function tries to process using the incorrect command.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` function to use the correct command and handle the response accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', version ')[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected version, we are using the correct command `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell and then extracting the version number from the output using `split` method. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
