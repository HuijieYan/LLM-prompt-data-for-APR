The potential error in the buggy function is the use of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command in the Popen function. This may be causing the recursive loop and hanging issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The bug is likely caused by the use of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' in the Popen call, which could be triggering a recursive loop and causing the hanging issue.

To fix the bug, we can directly access the FISH_VERSION environment variable without using the Popen call.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION', 'unknown')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By directly accessing the FISH_VERSION environment variable and using the os module, we avoid potential recursive loops and the hanging issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue.
