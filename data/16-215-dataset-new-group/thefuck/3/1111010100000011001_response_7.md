## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc_stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = proc_stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it does not properly handle the output from the `Popen` process. The `stdout` of the `Popen` process is read directly without properly communicating with the process, which can lead to incomplete or incorrect output being read.

To fix the bug, the corrected function uses `proc.communicate()` to properly handle the output of the `Popen` process and then decodes and strips the output to get the version of the Fish shell.

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`, we ensure that the entire output of the process is captured and processed correctly.

This fix satisfies the expected input/output values and ensures that the function returns the correct version of the Fish shell.
