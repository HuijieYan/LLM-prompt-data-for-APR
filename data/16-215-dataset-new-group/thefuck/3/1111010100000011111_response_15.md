## Analysis
The buggy function `Fish.info` is designed to return the name and version of the current shell by calling the Fish shell and extracting the version information using Popen. The expected output is the Fish shell version appended to the string "Fish Shell".

The GitHub issue indicates that when the `thefuck` plugin with the `-v` option is used in the Fish shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, it causes a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info` function. This suggests that the function may be incorrectly extracting the version information or causing an infinite loop.

## Error location
The potential error location is the line where the version information is being extracted from the process output.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is causing a recursive loop due to incorrect extraction of version information or due to improper handling of Popen process.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the process is handled correctly using `Popen` and that the version information is correctly extracted without causing a recursive loop.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `communicate` method is used to obtain the output and error streams. This ensures that the process is properly handled and the version information is extracted without causing a recursive loop.
