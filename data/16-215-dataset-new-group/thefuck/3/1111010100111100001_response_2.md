The bug in the given function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the output. The function is returning a string with the prefix "fish, version" instead of just the version number. This is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the command and then format it as "Fish Shell <version>.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now return the version number without the prefix, and the failing test should pass.
