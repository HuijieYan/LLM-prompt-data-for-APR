## Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs because the `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using `Popen`. However, the function is not properly handling the output of the command, which causes it to hang in certain scenarios, such as when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

In the GitHub issue, it is mentioned that the fix is on its way, so we can use this information to guide us in finding a solution.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output of the `Popen` command is properly handled, and that the function does not hang when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. We can also make use of the information provided in the GitHub issue to guide us in finding a solution.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            return 'Failed to get Fish shell version'
        else:
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to properly handle the output of the command. We also check the `returncode` of the process and return an error message if it is non-zero, indicating a failure to get the Fish shell version. This should resolve the hanging issue and ensure that the function works as expected, as guided by the information from the GitHub issue.
