The bug in the provided function is that the `proc.stdout.read()` method is being called before waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to an incomplete or empty result being read from the process.

To fix this bug, the Popen object needs to wait for the process to finish before reading the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
