## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function occurs because the command to get the fish version is incorrect. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This causes the Popen call to not capture the correct version of fish shell, leading to a failure in the test case.

The corrected version of the function uses the correct command to get the fish version 'fish --version' and returns the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test case.
