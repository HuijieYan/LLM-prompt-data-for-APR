The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect extraction of the version from the output of the 'fish' command. The error message shows that the output includes the string "fish, version" which is not being handled correctly by the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly extract the version from the output of the 'fish' command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version from the output
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly extract the version from the output of the 'fish' command and return the correct result. It should pass the failing test case as well.
