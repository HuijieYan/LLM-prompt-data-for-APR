Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of variables, the issue seems to be with the output of the `info` function. The function is returning `Fish Shell some_version_number` instead of `Fish Shell version_number`.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The version number is being extracted as `"fish, version 3.5.9"` instead of just `"3.5.9"`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version number from the command output and return the expected result. This should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
