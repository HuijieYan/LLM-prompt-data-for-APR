## The potential error location:
The potential error is likely in the `info` function's handling of the output from the `Popen` process.

## The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the 'info' function not properly handling the output from the 'Popen' process. It reads the output from the process using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` without considering that the output includes the words "fish, version". This results in the assertion error when comparing the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' with the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly parse the output of the 'Popen' process to extract only the version number that follows "fish, version".

## The corrected version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
