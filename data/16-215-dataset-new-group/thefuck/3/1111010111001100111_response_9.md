The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is causing issues when trying to get the version of the Fish shell. The problem seems to be with the command used to retrieve the version information and how it's processed.

The failing test is indicating that the expected version is '3.5.9', but the actual result from the `info` function is failing to match this expectation.

Analysis:
- The `Popen` call is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the shell version.
- The `stdout.read` method is used to read the output from the process, but it seems to be causing issues.

The GitHub issue further explains that the use of the `-v` flag with `thefuck` plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to adjust the command being used to retrieve the version and process the output properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').split()[2]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `['fish', '--version']` as the command, the version information can be obtained directly without the need for additional processing. The output is split to extract the version number, and then formatted as the expected return.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub link.
