## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the `Popen` method. It then reads the output of the process and formats it to return the version of the shell. The GitHub issue suggests that using the `-v` option with the `thefuck` plugin causes a recursive loop due to the `info` function.

The potential error locations in the function could be the way the `Popen` method is used and the method of reading the output of the process. 

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` method is not being properly closed after use, causing a recursive loop when the `-v` option is used with the `thefuck` plugin.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` method should be used with the `communicate` method, and the process should be properly closed after use.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to collect the output and error streams and wait for the process to complete.
2. Close the process after reading its output to prevent any recursive loop or resource leak.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.wait()
    proc.terminate()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function uses the `communicate` method to collect the output and error streams of the process and properly closes the process after reading its output. This should resolve the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
