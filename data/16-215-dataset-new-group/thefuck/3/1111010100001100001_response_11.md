The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function is not handling the scenario where the `proc` fails to execute or return a valid result.
2. The function is not handling the scenario where the `proc.stdout.read()` fails to return a valid result.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling potential errors that may occur during the execution of the `Popen` process and the reading of the process output.

To fix the bug, we can use a try-except block to catch any potential errors that may occur during the execution of the `Popen` process and the reading of the process output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                    stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception, e.g., return a default value or log the error
        return "Failed to retrieve Fish shell version"
```
