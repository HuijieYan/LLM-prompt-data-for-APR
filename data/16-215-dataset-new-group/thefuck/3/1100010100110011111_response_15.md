## The fixed version of the buggy function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function was not correctly parsing the version string returned from the command. This caused the version to include unnecessary text which led to the failing test.

To fix this, the version string is now split by the comma and the second part is selected to get only the version number without other unnecessary text.

This fix ensures that the function correctly returns the expected version number and passes the failing test.
