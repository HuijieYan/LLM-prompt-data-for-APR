The problem is that the `info` function is returning the entire output from the shell command, including "fish, version" which is causing the assertion to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to only extract the version number from the output of the shell command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version.split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

With this fix, the function will only return the version number without the "fish, version" prefix, and the failing test should pass.
