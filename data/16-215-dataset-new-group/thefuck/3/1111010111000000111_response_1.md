The potential error location within the buggy function:
1. The command used in Popen is missing the argument '--version' which is causing the infinite loop.
2. The decoding of the stdout of the subprocess might not be handled properly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the missing '--version' argument in the Popen command, resulting in the recursive loop. This is mentioned in the GitHub issue where the plugin uses 'thefuck -v' to decide when to regenerate functions, which triggers the recursive loop.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add the '--version' argument to the Popen command. Additionally, the stdout decoding should be handled properly to read the version information accurately.

The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
