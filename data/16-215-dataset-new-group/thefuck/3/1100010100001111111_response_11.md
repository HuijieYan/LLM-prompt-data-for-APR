## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is running into an issue in the context of the Fish shell. The problem arises from the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to extract the version, which causes a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to find an alternative approach to extracting the Fish shell version that does not trigger a recursive loop with the TheFuck plugin. One potential solution is to directly read the Fish shell configuration file to extract the version information.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'cat ~/.config/fish/config.fish | grep -w "version"'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, we use `cat ~/.config/fish/config.fish | grep -w "version"` to extract the version information from the Fish shell configuration file without triggering a recursive loop. This approach should resolve the issue with the TheFuck plugin and provide the expected version output.
