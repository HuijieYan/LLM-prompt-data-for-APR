The bug in the provided function is that the returned string includes the name of the shell ("fish") along with the version number, causing the assertion error in the test. The buggy function concatenates the "Fish Shell" prefix with the version number, resulting in the error.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to only extract the version number from the output of the command and return it with the "Fish Shell" prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this correction, the function will extract only the version number from the output of the command and return it with the "Fish Shell" prefix.

This fix should make the failing test pass, as the corrected function will return the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9".
