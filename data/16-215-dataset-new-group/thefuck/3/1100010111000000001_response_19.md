The potential error location within the `info` function is at the line that reads the output from the process: `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This line is trying to read the output from the `fish` process command, but it's not reading the correct message. The failing test indicates that the expected version is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the current logic is reading `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed is `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` as expected by the test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the Popen to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
