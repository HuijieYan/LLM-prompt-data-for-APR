The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the fact that the Popen command is returning the entire string "fish, version 3.5.9\n" instead of just the version number "3.5.9". This incorrect return value causes the assertion in the failing test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract only the version number from the returned string and format it correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we split the returned string by the ',' character and take the second part using `split(',')[1]`. Then, we strip any leading or trailing whitespace to get the version number.

With this change, the `info` function will correctly extract and format the version number from the output of the Popen command, and the failing test should pass.
