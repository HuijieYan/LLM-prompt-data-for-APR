The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the current shell by executing a command using the `Popen` function. However, the function is not handling the subprocess properly, leading to incorrect or unexpected values being returned.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of the subprocess `Popen` and its stdout.
2. The command used to retrieve the shell version may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the subprocess. The `stdout.read()` method is not being called after the subprocess is executed, and the command to retrieve the shell version might not be accurate. This results in the incorrect version being returned.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the subprocess by waiting for it to complete and then reading the output from stdout. Additionally, the command used to retrieve the shell version should be validated to ensure it returns the expected version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command to retrieve the shell version has been changed to `['fish', '--version']` and the `wait()` method has been added to ensure the subprocess has completed before reading the output from stdout. This should address the issues with the original buggy function and ensure that the correct version of the shell is returned.
