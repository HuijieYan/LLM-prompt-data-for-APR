The buggy function `info` in the file `fish.py` fails to provide the correct version of the Fish shell. It attempts to retrieve the Fish version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` module from the `subprocess` library, but it doesn't match the expected values.

The potential error location is within the command passed to `Popen` and the way the output is processed.

The cause of the bug is that the command passed to `Popen` does not match the actual command used to retrieve the Fish version. Additionally, the function is expecting a different output format than what is actually being received.

To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`, and the processing of the output should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should correctly retrieve the Fish shell version when tested and should align with the expected values. Additionally, this fix should resolve the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the erroneous behavior of the `info` function.
