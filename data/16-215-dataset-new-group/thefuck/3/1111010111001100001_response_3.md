The buggy function fails because it is not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell. The call to Popen is using the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version' which is causing the version to be incorrectly captured.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. Additionally, the assertion in the test function should be modified to check for the correct call_args.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the test function should pass successfully.
