## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. However, when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish, it triggers a recursive loop, causing the shell initialization to hang.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to avoid triggering the recursive loop when using the `thefuck` plugin with Oh-My-Fish.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return u'Fish Shell (version not available)'
```
