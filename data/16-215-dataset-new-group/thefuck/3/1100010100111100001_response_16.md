The bug in the `info` function is causing the incorrect version string to be returned, resulting in a failing test. The current implementation is not correctly capturing the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

The issue is that the result of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not returning the expected version string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly retrieve the version string from the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8')  # Decode the bytes to a string
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By decoding the bytes to a string separately, we ensure that the version string is obtained correctly from the command output. This should resolve the failing test case.
