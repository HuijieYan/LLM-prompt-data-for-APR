## Analysis
The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. It uses the `Popen` function to execute a command and capture the output, but there seem to be issues with how the output is handled, which might be causing the reported problem on GitHub.

## Identified Bug
The bug seems to be in the way the output from the `Popen` command is handled. It appears that the `read()` method is being called directly on `proc.stdout` which can lead to a potential hang, especially when used with the `-v` flag, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should capture the output of the `Popen` command properly and handle it without causing any hangs or recursive loops. We can modify the code to use the `communicate()` method of the `proc` object, which will allow us to capture the process output without causing any hangs.

## The corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected function, we are capturing the output of the `Popen` command using the `communicate()` method, which should prevent any hangs or recursive loops. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function returns the expected output without causing any problems.
