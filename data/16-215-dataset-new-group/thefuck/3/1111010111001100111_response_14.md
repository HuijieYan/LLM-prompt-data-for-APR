## Correction

Based on the given information, the issue in the `info` function of the `Fish` class seems to be caused by the incorrect command being used to get the version of the Fish shell. The test functions are expecting the version to be obtained using `fish --version`, but the function is actually using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This mismatch is causing the tests to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to update the command used to obtain the Fish shell version to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(" ")[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will use the correct command to obtain the Fish shell version, and the tests should pass as expected.
