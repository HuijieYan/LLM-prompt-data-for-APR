## The potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The Popen function is called with the incorrect command and arguments.
2. The method for retrieving the version of the Fish shell is incorrect.

## The cause of the bug:
The `info` function in the `Fish` class attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `Popen` function with an incorrect command and arguments. This leads to the incorrect version being retrieved, which causes the failing test and triggers a recursive loop, resulting in a hang during the initialization of the Fish shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command and arguments passed to the `Popen` function to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.
2. Modify the method for retrieving the version of the Fish shell to address the recursive loop issue.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```
