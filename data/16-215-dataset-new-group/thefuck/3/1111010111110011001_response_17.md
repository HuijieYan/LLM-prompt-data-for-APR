The cause of the bug is that the function is not capturing the correct shell version due to an incorrect command being used to retrieve it.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct command to retrieve the shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

This fix involves using the correct command to retrieve the shell version (using `--version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`). Additionally, the extracted version is cleaned up using `replace` to remove the unnecessary prefix.

With this fix, the function should now return the correct shell version, and the failing test case should pass.
