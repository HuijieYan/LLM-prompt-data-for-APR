Based on the analysis of the provided information, the potential error in the buggy function `info()` is the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` to extract the fish version. This is causing an incorrect version string to be returned and failing the test.

The error message clearly shows that the expected version string is different from the actual result, indicating that the version extraction logic in the `info()` function is incorrect.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the command used in the `Popen` call to `fish --version` to correctly extract the fish version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

This corrected version uses `fish --version` to retrieve the version string and then extracts the version number from the output. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct version string, passing the failing test and resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
