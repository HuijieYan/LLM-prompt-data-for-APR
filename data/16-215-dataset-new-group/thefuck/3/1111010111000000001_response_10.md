The cause of the bug is that the call to Popen is using the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version', and the assertion in the failing test is checking for the latter.

The fix for the bug is to change the command passed to Popen from 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' to 'fish --version'.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the test function should now pass without any errors.
