## Analysis
The `info` function within the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using `Popen` but the result is not being parsed correctly. The error message indicates that the function is returning the version in an unexpected format.

## Identified Potential Error Location
The potential error location is in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, where the output from the command is read and decoded into a string.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not correctly parsing the output of the command executed by `Popen`. This results in the version being returned in an unexpected format, leading to the assertion error in the test.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The output from the command needs to be correctly parsed to retrieve the version number. This can be done by splitting the output string and extracting the version number from it.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the `info` function correctly extracts the version number from the output of the command executed by `Popen`. This should allow the function to return the correct version and pass the failing test.
