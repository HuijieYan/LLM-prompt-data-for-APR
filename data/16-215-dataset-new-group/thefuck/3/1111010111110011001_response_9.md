The issue in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command used is `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is not the correct way to get the Fish shell version.

To fix this issue, we need to update the command to `fish --version` to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command, and the failing test case should pass.
