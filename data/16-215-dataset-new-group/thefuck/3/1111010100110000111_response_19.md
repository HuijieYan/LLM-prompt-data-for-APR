Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class of `shells/fish.py` is not correctly parsing the version of the Fish shell. The issue on GitHub also suggests that this causes a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin and triggers a hang.

The potential error location is the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved and then formatted.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the version of the Fish shell, leading to an incorrect output and potentially causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to correctly parse the version of the Fish shell and then format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'. Additionally, the potential recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin needs to be addressed.

Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(",")[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number from the output of 'fish -v'
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By using `['fish', '-v']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, we retrieve the version of the Fish shell directly. Then, by splitting the output and extracting the version number, we can correctly format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
