The issue is that the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is not using the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being used, but it should be `fish --version`. This is causing the test to fail and causing a recursive loop when the plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version. We also need to update the test to reflect the correct command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1])
```

And the corrected version of the test:

```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
