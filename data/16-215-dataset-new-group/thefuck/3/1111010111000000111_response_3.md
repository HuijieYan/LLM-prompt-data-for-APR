## Analysis
The buggy function is part of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess and reading the output. However, the test case provided expects the version to be obtained by executing `fish --version`, which is not currently being done in the buggy `info` function.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect command to retrieve Fish shell version
2. Incorrect use of subprocess

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not fetching the Fish shell version using the correct command (`fish --version`). This leads to a failing test case and triggers a recursive loop, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to execute the `fish --version` command and read the output to obtain the correct version of the Fish shell.

## Buggy Function - Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function uses the correct `fish --version` command to obtain the version of the Fish shell. It then processes the output to extract the version number and returns it in the specified format.

With this correction, the failing test case should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
