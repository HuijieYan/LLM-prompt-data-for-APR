The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly retrieving the version of the Fish shell. It is trying to read the standard output of the process using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` but it is not producing the correct version string.

The error message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This suggests that the version string is not being correctly extracted from the process output.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the version string along with additional text, and the function is not correctly parsing this output to retrieve the version number.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way in which the version string is retrieved from the process output. We can use string manipulation to extract the version number from the returned string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to correctly extract the version number from the process output and return the expected result.
