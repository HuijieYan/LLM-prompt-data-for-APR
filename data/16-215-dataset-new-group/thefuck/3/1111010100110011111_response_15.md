## Correction

The issue with the original function is that it calls `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` without waiting for the process to finish, which causes the assertion error in the failing test. This can be fixed by using `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and capture its output.

### Corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):



    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function will wait for the process to finish before reading its output, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
