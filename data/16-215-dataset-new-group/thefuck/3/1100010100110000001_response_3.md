The buggy function `info` has a couple of issues:

1. The assertion error comes from comparing 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' with 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This indicates that the prefix 'fish, version' is not correctly removed from the output, leading to an incorrect comparison.

2. The other issue is that the `Popen` instance is not correctly mocked in the test. The test assigns a side_effect to `Popen.return_value.stdout.read`, but the function does not actually use `Popen.return_value` to read the output from the process.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly read and format the output from the `Popen` command.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(", version ")[1])
```
By using `proc.communicate()[0]` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the output is read correctly. Then we use `version.split(", version ")[1]` to extract the version number and format it accordingly.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
