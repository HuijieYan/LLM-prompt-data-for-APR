The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without properly waiting for the process to finish. This can result in the function trying to read from the process before it has actually executed and produced output.

To fix the bug, we can add a call to `proc.wait()` after the `Popen` call to ensure that the process has finished before we attempt to read its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the `proc.wait()` call, we ensure that the process has finished before trying to read its output, which should fix the bug.
