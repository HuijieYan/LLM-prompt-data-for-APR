## Analysis
The buggy function uses the Popen class from the subprocess module to execute a command in the Fish shell and retrieve the version. However, it's not handling the output correctly, leading to the version output being incorrect.

The expected input to the function is the command to retrieve the Fish shell version, and the output is the string "Fish Shell" followed by the version number.

The GitHub issue indicates that the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to the buggy function.

## Bug Cause
The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line is not correctly capturing the version output from the command. This results in the version being extracted with additional characters (such as "fish, version") which causes the assertion to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix involves capturing and parsing the output of the command to retrieve the correct version string. This can be done by using `check_output` instead of `Popen` to easily capture the output of the command.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
By using `check_output`, we directly capture the output of the command and decode it to get the version string. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
