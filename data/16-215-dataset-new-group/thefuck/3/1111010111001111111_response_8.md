To fix the bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class, we need to update the command used to obtain the version of the Fish shell and handle the output correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, and the way the output is processed is leading to an incorrect version value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and handle the output properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the command to get the version of the Fish shell by using `['fish', '--version']`, and then we extract the version number from the output. This will ensure that the correct version is retrieved and returned.

With this correction, the `info` method should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix should resolve the GitHub issue related to triggering a recursive loop in the Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
