### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `info` function is caused by not waiting for the subprocess to finish before reading from its stdout. This can lead to reading an empty string if the subprocess has not finished running or has not yet written to its stdout.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish before reading from its stdout.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the subprocess to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
