The issue with the current buggy function is that it is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, due to the Fish.info() function. This is leading to a hanging of the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

The cause of this bug is due to the call to the `thefuck -v` command in the buggy function `info`. This triggers a recursive loop, as mentioned in the GitHub issue, leading to the hanging of the initialization. The expected output of the function is also incorrect as it does not match the expected version string format.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `info` function to avoid triggering the recursive loop caused by the `thefuck -v` command. We can directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without using the `thefuck -v` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we replaced the `thefuck -v` command with `fish -v` to directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without triggering the recursive loop. Now the function should return the expected version string format and avoid the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
