The bug in the `info` function is that it is not capturing the correct output for the Fish Shell version. The function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but the expected output format is different. 

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the expected output format.

To fix the bug, we can update the command to `fish -c 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'`. This will ensure that the output includes the correct version format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'{}'.format(version)
```
