## The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The Popen command might not be executing properly or returning the correct output.
2. The decoding of the output using utf-8 might be causing issues with the string comparison.

## The cause of the bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of the output of the Popen command that retrieves the version of the Fish shell. The decoding of the output and comparison with the expected version is not handled correctly.

## A strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output of the Popen command is correctly handled and decoded before comparison. Additionally, we need to compare the version retrieved from the shell with the expected version in a way that accounts for any formatting differences or extra characters in the output.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected version of the function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_parts = version.split(', version ')
        if len(version_parts) == 2:
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_parts[1])
        else:
            return "Fish Shell version not found"
```

By splitting the retrieved version string and only returning the version number part, we ensure that the comparison with the expected version is accurate. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
