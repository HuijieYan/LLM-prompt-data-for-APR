The bug in the `info` function is likely caused by a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin triggers a call to `thefuck -v`. This recursive loop is likely causing the function to hang during the initialization of the Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `info` function to avoid the recursive loop by checking if the command being executed is `thefuck -v`. If it is, we can return a different value without making the subprocess call.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv:
        return 'Fish Shell (version information skipped for thefuck -v)'
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we check if the '-v' argument is in the `sys.argv` list, which indicates that `thefuck -v` is being called. If it is, we return a different message without making the subprocess call. This should prevent the recursive loop and resolve the hanging issue during the shell initialization.
