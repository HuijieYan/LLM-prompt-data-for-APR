## Analysis
The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. However, it is not handling the return value correctly, as it is trying to read the output directly from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to finish. This is causing the assertion error as the expected value is `'fish, version 3.5.9'` but the actual value is just `'3.5.9'`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not waiting for the `Popen` process to finish and not handling the output correctly.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish and then read the output. We also need to modify the expected return value to match the actual version string.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
