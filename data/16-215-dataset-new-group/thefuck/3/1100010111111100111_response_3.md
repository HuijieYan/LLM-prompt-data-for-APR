Based on the error message from the failing test, the main issue in the `info` function is that it's returning a string containing the unexpected initial part of the Fish shell version. The returned string includes the word "fish," which is not expected. This results in an assertion error in the failing test.

The cause of this bug is that the call to `Popen` with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is not capturing the right output. Instead, it should capture the output of the command `['fish', '--version']`.

To fix the bug, update the `Popen` command to capture the correct output. Then format the version string as per the test's expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the Popen command to use `['fish', '--version']` the correct version information is obtained, and the output is formatted as per the test's expected value.
