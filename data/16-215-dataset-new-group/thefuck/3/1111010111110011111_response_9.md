The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is attempting to read the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This causes the returned version to be in an unexpected format, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated to `fish --version`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub about the recursive loop triggered by the use of `thefuck -v` command.
