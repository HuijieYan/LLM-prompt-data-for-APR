## Fixing the bug

The issue appears to be related to a recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This recursion is caused by the `Fish.info()` function in the `fish.py` file.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info()` function to prevent the recursion caused by the `thefuck -v` command.

## Revised code for the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the revised function
    @cache
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        if version:
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return u'Fish Shell'
    
```

In the revised code, I've added a caching mechanism to the `info()` function to prevent recursive loops. The `@cache` decorator used in the function memoizes the result and returns it if the function is called with the same arguments, preventing unnecessary re-execution of the command.

This fix should prevent the recursive loop caused by the `thefuck -v` command when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
