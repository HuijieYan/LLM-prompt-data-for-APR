The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output. The potential error locations in this buggy function include:
1. Reading from the `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to complete, which could lead to an incomplete or empty output.
2. Not handling any potential exceptions that may arise during the `Popen` process.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not wait for the process to finish, and it also doesn't handle any exceptions that may occur during the process, leading to potential incomplete or missing output.

To fix the bug, we should wait for the process to complete and handle any exceptions that may occur. One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to complete and capture the output, and add exception handling to gracefully handle any errors that may arise during the process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return "Fish Shell version could not be retrieved"
```
