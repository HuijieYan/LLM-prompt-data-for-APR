The bug in the `info` function is causing the incorrect output because it is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the `fish` command. The `Popen` mock object is returning the wrong value for the `stdout.read` method, which leads to an incorrect version being extracted from the process output. As a result, the assertion in the test fails because the expected output does not match the actual output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the function extracts the version number from the process output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected version, we added a split operation to extract just the version number from the output of the `fish` command. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct version number, which will make the test pass.
