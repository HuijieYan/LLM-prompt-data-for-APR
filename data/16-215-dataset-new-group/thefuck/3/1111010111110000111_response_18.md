The potential error in the `Fish.info()` function is the command used to fetch the version of Fish shell. The `Popen` function is not properly capturing the version and is leading to the wrong output of `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

The test is expecting the version of Fish shell to be captured and returned correctly, which is not happening due to the incorrect command in the `Popen` call.

To fix the bug, the command used in the `Popen` call needs to be updated to correctly fetch the Fish shell version.

In the provided corrected version, the command used in the `Popen` call is updated to capture the Fish shell version correctly.

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

With this corrected version, the `Popen` call is updated to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version, and the `info()` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, resolving the bug.
