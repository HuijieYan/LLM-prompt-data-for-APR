## Plan for fixing the bug
The error message indicates that the output of the `info` function is not correctly returning the version of the Fish shell. The `assert` statement in the test is comparing the expected version with the actual version retrieved from the shell, and there is a mismatch.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell from the output of the Popen command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly process the output of the Popen command and extract the version of the Fish shell.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output string by the delimiter ", version ", we can correctly extract the version number of the Fish shell. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
