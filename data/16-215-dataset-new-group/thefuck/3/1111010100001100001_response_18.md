The bug in the given function seems to be related to how the output of the subprocess is being handled. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` part seems to be causing the issue.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by not waiting for the subprocess to finish before reading its output. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect output being captured, causing the function to return incorrect information about the shell version.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should wait for the subprocess to finish before reading its output. This can be achieved by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to finish and captures its output.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
