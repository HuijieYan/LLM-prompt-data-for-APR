The bug in the provided function "info" is causing the failing test. The function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" and returning it as a string. However, the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command, resulting in the incorrect version being returned.

The failing test is asserting that the version returned by the function should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it is actually returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This indicates that the function is not correctly parsing the version string from the command output.

The given runtime values show that the Popen call is being mocked and is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual command output. This indicates that the issue is likely related to how the function is handling the command output.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly parse the version string from the output of the command and return it in the format 'Fish Shell <version>'. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly parse the version from the command output and return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected by the failing test.
