The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, it should use `fish --version`.

The incorrect command is causing the `Popen` call to return unexpected output, which leads to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the `Popen` call to `fish --version` to correctly obtain the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected Fish shell version.
