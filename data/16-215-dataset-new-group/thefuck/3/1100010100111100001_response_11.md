Based on the provided error message and runtime values, it seems that the `info` function is returning the string `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy is due to the incorrect formatting of the version string retrieved from the `fish` shell.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is returning a string that includes the word "fish" and contains an extra comma, which is not expected in the output.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `info` function to extract only the version number from the output of the `fish` shell command. We can achieve this by splitting the output on the comma and replacing any whitespace before and after the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
