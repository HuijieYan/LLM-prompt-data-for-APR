## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The way the version is being retrieved from the subprocess call may not be correct, leading to the unexpected output "fish, version 3.5.9".

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the output from the subprocess call. The function is currently returning the entire output from the command, including "fish, version" which is not expected.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to parse the output of the subprocess call correctly and extract only the version number without the extra information.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
