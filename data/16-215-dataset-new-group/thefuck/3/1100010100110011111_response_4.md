## Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function is the `info` method in the `shells/fish.py` file. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it fails to do so based on the error message.

The error message indicates an assertion error in the test case for the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the function is not correctly parsing the version information from the shell.

The GitHub issue indicates that the bug causes a recursive loop due to the use of the `thefuck -v` command in the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The fix is in progress to resolve the issue.

## Identifying potential error locations

The potential error location in the buggy function is the parsing of the version information from the shell command output. It seems that the parsing is not correctly extracting the version number, leading to the incorrect output.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the version information obtained from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. This results in the incorrect formation of the return string, causing the assertion error in the test case.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the parsing of the version information from the command output needs to be improved. This may involve using regular expressions or string manipulation to extract the version number and format it correctly in the return string.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `info` function parses the version information from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command output using the `split` method to extract the version number. This ensures that the correct version number is obtained and formatted correctly in the return string.
