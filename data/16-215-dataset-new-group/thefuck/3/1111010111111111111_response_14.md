The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is that it is attempting to get the Fish shell version using `echo $FISH_VERSION` but it should actually use `fish --version` instead.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the command used to get the version of the Fish shell.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `info` uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell, but the correct command should be `fish --version`. This is causing the test to fail because the expected version is 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual version is just '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be updated to execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and format it correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the command in the `info` function to use `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell and then format the output string accordingly.

### Updated and Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
