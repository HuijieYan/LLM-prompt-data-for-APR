The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The function is trying to read the version from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`. This mismatch between the command used in the function and the expected command in the test is causing the bug.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command `fish --version` to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test and return the expected value `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
