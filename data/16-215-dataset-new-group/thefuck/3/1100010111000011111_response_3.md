## Correction to the bug

The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command being used to get the Fish shell version, which leads to unexpected behavior and fails the test. The `Popen` call should use the `--version` argument instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Additionally, the test case is utilizing the wrong value to be returned by the `stdout.read` side effect. The correct value should be `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` as mentioned in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test case. This should also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
