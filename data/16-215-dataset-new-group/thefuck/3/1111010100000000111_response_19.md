## Analysis:
The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class. It is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell. The bug is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations are the `Popen` call and the `proc.stdout.read()` call. These are the areas where the recursive loop could be occurring.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing a recursive loop because the `thefuck -v` command is triggering the `Fish.info()` function, which in turn triggers the `thefuck -v` command again, creating an infinite loop.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to identify a way to prevent the recursive loop from occurring when the `thefuck -v` command is used. This can be done by checking the context in which the `info` function is being called and adding a conditional check to prevent the recursive loop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if 'THEFUCK_SHELL_INFO' in os.environ:
            return os.environ['THEFUCK_SHELL_INFO']
        else:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to see if the `THEFUCK_SHELL_INFO` environment variable is present. If it is, we return its value to prevent the recursive loop. Otherwise, we proceed with the original functionality of the function. This change will prevent the recursive loop from occurring when the `info` function is called within the context of the `thefuck -v` command.
