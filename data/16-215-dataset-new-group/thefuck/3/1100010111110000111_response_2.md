The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in `thefuck/shells/fish.py` is causing the test to fail. The `info` function is calling the `Popen` function with `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which retrieves the Fish shell version. However, the test is expecting to receive `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` and convert it into 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', while the actual output received is different. This results in an assertion error.

To fix this bug, the `info` function should be modified to call `['fish', '--version']` rather than `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to match the expected output from the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', version ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
