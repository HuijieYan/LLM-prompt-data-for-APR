The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command should use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This results in the incorrect version being retrieved and compared in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be updated to use `fish --version` to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `fish --version` command, and the failing test should now pass.
