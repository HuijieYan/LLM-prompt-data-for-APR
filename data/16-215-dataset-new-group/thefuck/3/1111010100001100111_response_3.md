The issue with the `Fish.info` function is that it causes a recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command within Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin. This is due to the way the function retrieves the Fish shell version, potentially causing an infinite loop.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to use a different method to retrieve the Fish shell version that does not trigger the infinite loop within the plugin.

Here is the corrected version of the `Fish.info` function:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL).communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `Popen.communicate()` method to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, which avoids triggering the infinite loop issue. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
