Based on the provided information, it appears that the current implementation of the `info` method in the `Fish` class is not properly handling the output from the `Popen` command. This leads to an incorrect version string being returned, causing the failing test.

The error message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This suggests that the version string is being prefixed with 'fish, version' due to an issue in the `info` method.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the way the result of the `Popen` command is processed and returned as the version string. The `Popen` call is used to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capture the output, but the method for extracting the version from the command output is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `info` method needs to properly parse the output of the `Popen` command to extract just the version number without any additional text. This can be achieved by using the `communicate` method on the `Popen` object to retrieve the output and then extract the version from it.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract just the version number
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the method should properly extract the version number from the output of the `Popen` command and return it in the expected format. This should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
