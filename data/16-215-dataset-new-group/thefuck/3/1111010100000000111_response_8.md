## Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function is the info() method within the Fish class in the file fish.py. The function is used to return the name and version of the current shell, but it causes a recursive loop when the oh-my-fish plugin uses the thefuck -v command. This results in the Fish shell's initialization hanging.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location is in the `Popen` call, which executes the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop due to the incorrect execution of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command within the info() function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the info() function to not cause a recursive loop when the oh-my-fish plugin uses the thefuck -v command. This likely involves changing how the shell version is retrieved.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].strip().decode('utf-8')
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command to retrieve the Fish shell version has been changed to 'fish --version' and the way the output is captured has been modified to avoid the recursive loop issue.
