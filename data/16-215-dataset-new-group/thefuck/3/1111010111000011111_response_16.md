## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
- The original function is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it should be using 'fish --version' instead.
- The failing test is expecting the output of the command 'fish --version' to be parsed and displayed as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', so the function needs to be updated to return the correct format.
- The GitHub issue mentions that the plugin is triggering a recursive loop due to the incorrect behavior of the function.
- The corrected version of the function uses the correct command to retrieve the shell version and formats the output as expected by the failing test. This should resolve the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values while also addressing the issue posted on GitHub.
