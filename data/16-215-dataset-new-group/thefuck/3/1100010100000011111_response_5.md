## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to get the version of the Fish shell. This can lead to hanging if the command execution does not complete properly.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the expected input/output variable values, the GitHub Issue information.
The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` executed in the Fish shell might not complete properly, leading to a hanging situation. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which mentions that the use of the plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the hanging of the function.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
A strategy for fixing the bug would be to use a more robust method for getting the Fish shell version that does not result in potential hanging. This could involve using a different command execution method or handling potential errors and timeouts.

## Provide a corrected version of the function
A corrected version of the function can use the `subprocess.run` method with a timeout to execute the command and retrieve the version. This can help prevent hanging and handle potential errors.

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        completed_process = run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                check=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, timeout=5, text=True)
        version = completed_process.stdout.strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except (CalledProcessError, TimeoutExpired):
        return u'Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version'
```
In the corrected version, `subprocess.run` is used with `timeout` parameter to prevent hanging, and potential errors are handled with a try-except block. This should help resolve the hanging issue and provide a more robust way to retrieve the Fish Shell version.
