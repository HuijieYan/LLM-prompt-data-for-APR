The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version from the `Popen` command. The function is currently returning the entire string "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just the version "3.5.9". This is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to only return the version number by splitting the string and extracting the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_number = version.split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly return the version number and pass the failing test. It also addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version parsing.
