The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The `Popen` call is using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which does not return the shell version in the expected format. This is causing the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be changed to use `fish --version` to retrieve the shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_str.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version uses the `fish --version` command to retrieve the version information and then parses the result to extract the version number.

With this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue in the GitHub repository should be resolved.
