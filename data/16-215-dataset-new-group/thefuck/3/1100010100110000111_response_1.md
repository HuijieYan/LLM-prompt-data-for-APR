1. The error message indicates an assertion error when comparing the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' with the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the subprocess call using Popen and the decoding of the output.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, which results in additional text ('fish, version') being included in the version string. This is related to the GitHub issue as it describes a recursive loop triggered by the info() function in fish.py.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version string is parsed from the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command to correctly extract just the version number.
5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if version.startswith('fish, version'):
        version = version.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, after decoding the output, we check if the version starts with 'fish, version' and then extract just the version number by splitting the string and taking the last element. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct version string.
