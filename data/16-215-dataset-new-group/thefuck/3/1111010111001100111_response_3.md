## The cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is trying to get the Fish shell version by executing `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` but it should be using `fish --version`. This causes a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, leading to a hang.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to `fish --version` instead of `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

## The corrected version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
