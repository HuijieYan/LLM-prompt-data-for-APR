The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is due to the incorrect reading of the version information from the subprocess output. The `stdout.read()` method returns the entire output at once, causing the actual version string to include the initial "fish, version" prefix. This leads to a mismatch when formatting the output in the return statement, resulting in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the version string needs to be parsed to remove the "fish, version" prefix before formatting it in the return statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', '').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will accurately strip the "fish, version" prefix from the version string before returning the formatted output. This should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
