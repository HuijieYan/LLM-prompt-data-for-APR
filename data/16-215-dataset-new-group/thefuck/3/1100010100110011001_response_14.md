The buggy function `info` calls the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command and retrieve the version of the shell. The error message indicates that the function is returning the entire string "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just "3.5.9".

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly stripping the unnecessary text from the output of the executed command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to only extract the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # extract the last word as the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output and extracting the last word, we ensure that only the version number is returned. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output.

With the corrected function, it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
