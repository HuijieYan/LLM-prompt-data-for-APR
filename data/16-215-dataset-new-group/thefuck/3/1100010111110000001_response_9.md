The bug in the `info` function is that it uses the wrong command to get the version of the Fish shell. It uses `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` but it should use `'fish --version'`.

To fix the bug, simply replace `echo $FISH_VERSION` with `fish --version` in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version.split(",")[1].strip()}'
```

With this fix, the `info` function should correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and the failing test should pass.
