The `info` function is expected to return the name and version of the current shell, using the `Popen` function to execute a command and capture the output.

The test is failing with the error message:
```
AssertionError: assert 'Fish Shell f...version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
```
This shows that the actual output contains "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of the expected "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed in the `Popen` function is not correct, and it's not capturing the version information properly.

To fix this bug, the command being passed to the `Popen` function needs to be corrected to capture the actual version information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the command being executed in `Popen` is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to capture the version information correctly.
