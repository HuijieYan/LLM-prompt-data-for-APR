The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being used, but it should be `fish --version` to get the correct version string.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
