## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function was using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This was causing the test to fail because the expected version string was not being fetched correctly.

The corrected version of the function uses the correct command ('fish --version') to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and it will now pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values.
