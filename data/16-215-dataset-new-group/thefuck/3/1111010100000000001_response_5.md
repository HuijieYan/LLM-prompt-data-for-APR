Corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)  # Added shell=True to run the command through the shell
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()  # Replaced proc.stdout.read() with proc.communicate()[0]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Removed unnecessary 'u' prefix
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function `info` is caused by not using `shell=True` when invoking the `Popen` function, and by using `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output of the process instead of `proc.communicate()[0]`. This can lead to the function not working as intended and not returning the correct version of the Fish shell.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add `shell=True` when invoking the `Popen` function to ensure that the command is run through the shell.
2. Replace `proc.stdout.read()` with `proc.communicate()[0]` to properly read the output of the process.

The corrected version of the function `info` has been provided above.
