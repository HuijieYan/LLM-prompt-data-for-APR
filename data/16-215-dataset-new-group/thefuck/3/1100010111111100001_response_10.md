Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function is that the command used to get the Fish shell version is incorrect, resulting in the wrong version being returned. This is evident from the failing test, where the expected version ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') does not match the actual version ('Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9').

To fix the bug, the command being executed by Popen needs to be corrected to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command `['fish', '--version']` is used instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to correctly obtain the Fish shell version. This change should ensure that the correct version is retrieved and the failing test passes.

After making this change, the corrected function should return the expected version ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') as per the failing test.
