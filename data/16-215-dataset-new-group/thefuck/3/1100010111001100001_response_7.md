The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the fish shell version is incorrect. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the version number of the fish shell, causing the function to return an incorrect value.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the fish shell version should be changed to `fish --version`, which is the correct command to get the version number of the fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
