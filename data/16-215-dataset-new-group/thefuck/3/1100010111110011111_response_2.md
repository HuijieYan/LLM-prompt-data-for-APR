Based on the failing test and the given error message, it's evident that the issue lies in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file under the `thefuck.shells` package. The expected output of the function is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but it is currently returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. It's including the word "fish" and a comma as part of the version string. This results in an assertion error when compared with the expected output of the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly parse the output and construct the version string as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[0].split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly parse the output of the `fish --version` command and return the expected version string.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and also pass the failing test case.
