To fix the bug in the `info` function, we need to update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell and also fix the way the process output is read. The current implementation doesn't match the test expectations because it uses a different command to retrieve the version and does not properly handle the process output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Use readline to read the output line by line
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Explanation of the changes:
1. Updated the command to retrieve the version by using `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
2. Used `proc.stdout.readline()` to read the output line by line and decode it to get the version.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
