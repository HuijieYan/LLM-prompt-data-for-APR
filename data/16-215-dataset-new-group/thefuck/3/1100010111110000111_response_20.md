The buggy function is the `info()` function in the `fish.py` file which is part of the `thefuck` project. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.

The potential error location is in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, where the output of the `Popen` command is being processed to extract the version.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `Popen` command is executed with the argument `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is expecting the version to be extracted from the output of `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be executed with the argument `['fish', '--version']` in order to match the expectation of the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

With this modification, the `info()` function will return the correct version of the Fish Shell, and the failing test will pass. This should also resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the plugin.
