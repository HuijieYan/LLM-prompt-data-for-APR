## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        if version.startswith('fish, version'):
            version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the `info` function checks if the version string starts with "fish, version" and removes it before returning the shell name and version. This addresses the issue where the version string contains "fish, version" in addition to the version number.

With this correction, the function will return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as required by the failing test case. This will also resolve the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the `info` function.
