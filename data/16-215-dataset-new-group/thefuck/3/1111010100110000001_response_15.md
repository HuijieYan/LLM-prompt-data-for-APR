The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and reading the output, then formatting it into a string. The bug is due to the incorrect formatting of the version string because of:
1. The extra word "fish" in the output before the version number.
2. Incorrect comparison of the expected and the actual output.

To fix the bug, the extra word "fish," needs to be removed from the version string. Additionally, the comparison of the expected and actual output should be properly done to ensure the correct format is used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string and extracting the last element and comparing it properly, the bug should be fixed. This change should make the comparison of the expected and actual output to pass the test successfully.
