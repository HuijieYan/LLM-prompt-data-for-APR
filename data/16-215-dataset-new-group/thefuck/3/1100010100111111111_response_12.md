The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect way the `version` variable is being obtained from the output of the `Popen` process. The `version` is expected to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but it is actually '3.5.9'.

To fix this bug, the correct command needs to be used to obtain the Fish version. The command `fish -v` will provide the correct version information.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also addresses the issue posted in GitHub.
