To fix the buggy function, it is clear that the issue lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and the parsing of the version from the output. The Popen call should use the command ['fish', '--version'] instead of ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] to get the Fish shell version. Additionally, the version parsing from the output should be adjusted to match the format 'fish, version x.x.x'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected function, it should successfully retrieve the Fish shell version and return the expected output, passing the failing test case and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
