## Analysis
The `info` function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. However, the function is not correctly retrieving the version and returning the string in the correct format.

## Bug
The bug in the code is that `proc.stdout.read()` is not returning the expected output.

## Fix
We can fix the bug by using `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly retrieve the output.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
