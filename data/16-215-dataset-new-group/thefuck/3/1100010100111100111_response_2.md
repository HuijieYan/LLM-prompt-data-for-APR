Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of variables, it appears that there is an issue with the way the version of the Fish shell is being extracted. The Popen object is being mocked and the stdout.read() method is also being mocked, but the value returned is not being properly formatted.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the version output from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and is returning it in an incorrect format.

To fix the bug, the function should properly parse the output of the command and return it in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This version of the function will properly extract the version number from the command output and return it in the correct format, which should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
