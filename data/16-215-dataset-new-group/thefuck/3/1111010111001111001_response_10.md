Based on the failing test and the runtime values, it seems that the `Popen` call is being made with the wrong arguments, which causes the test to fail. The expected input to the `Popen` call should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `Popen` call in the `info` function to use the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected `Popen` call, the test should now pass and the function should return the expected output.
