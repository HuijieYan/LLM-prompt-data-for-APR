The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using the `Popen` function. The expected output of this command is `fish, version 3.5.9`, which needs to be captured and returned in the format `Fish Shell 3.5.9`. However, the current implementation does not handle the command output correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the expected output `fish, version 3.5.9` is not being captured properly from the `Popen` process.

To fix the bug, we need to capture the output of the `Popen` process correctly and format it to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. We then capture the output, extract the version from it, and format it to match the expected output.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
