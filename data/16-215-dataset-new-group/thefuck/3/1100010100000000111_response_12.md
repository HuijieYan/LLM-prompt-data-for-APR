## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is used to get the name and version of the current shell. The issue on GitHub indicates that when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin with the `thefuck` command, it triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `Popen` call may be causing a recursive loop.
2. The `thefuck` command trigger may be causing the recursive loop.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug appears to be caused by the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop in the `Fish.info()` function provided in the `fish.py` file. It may be due to the way the `Popen` call is being used with `thefuck`.

## Suggested Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we can try using a different approach to retrieve the shell version and avoid any recursive loops. It may involve changing the way the `thefuck` command is used or modifying the `Fish.info()` function to handle the command differently.

## Corrected Version
```python
import os

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    # Use os.popen to retrieve the shell version
    version = os.popen('echo $FISH_VERSION').read().strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
