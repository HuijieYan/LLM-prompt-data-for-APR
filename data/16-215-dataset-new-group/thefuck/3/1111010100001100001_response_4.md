The issue with the buggy function is that it is not waiting for the process to finish before trying to read the stdout. This can lead to inconsistent results, especially if the process takes some time to complete.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to read from the stdout of the process before the process has finished executing, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to finish and then read the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `communicate()` method, we ensure that the process has finished before trying to read the stdout, thus fixing the bug.
