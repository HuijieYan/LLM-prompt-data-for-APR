The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class. The function tries to get the version of Fish shell using the `Popen` call to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, it should actually be calling `fish --version`. The failing test is `test_info` that expects the version of Fish shell to be fetched in a specific format. The error message from the failing test highlights that the function returns a version in an unexpected format. The GitHub issue also indicates that the version of Fish shell is being fetched incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call in the `info` function is using the incorrect command to fetch the version of Fish shell. It should be using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This results in the version being fetched in an unexpected format, causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to call `fish --version` using the `Popen` call, and then parse the output to extract the version in the required format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
