## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The cause of the bug is that the original function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the shell command. The error message shows that the actual result contains the string "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just the version number "3.5.9".

To fix the bug, we can split the version string using the `split(', ')` method and extract the second part, which is the version number.

The corrected function should return "Fish Shell 3.5.9" by properly extracting the version number from the shell command output.
