The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call in the `info` function is using the wrong command (`echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`), and the `stdout.read()` call is producing an incorrect version string, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `Popen` call to use the correct command (`fish --version`) and then parse the output to extract the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test case.
