## Analysis
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the current implementation uses `Popen` to execute a command to get the Fish shell version, but it does not handle the process correctly and is causing a hang.

## Identified Error
The `info` function is not handling the `Popen` process correctly, which is causing it to hang and create a recursive loop.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the recursive loop because the `Popen` process is not being handled properly. This is causing the function to hang and not return the expected shell version.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Popen` process is correctly handled. This includes waiting for the process to finish and capturing the standard output to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
