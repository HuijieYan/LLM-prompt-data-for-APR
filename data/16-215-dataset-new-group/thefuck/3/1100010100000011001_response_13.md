## Analysis
The bug in the `info` function lies in the way it tries to read the output of the `Popen` command. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is not being used correctly, which is causing the function to return the wrong value.

## Bug
The bug in the `info` function is that it is not using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to read the output of the command. This results in the incorrect version being returned.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to correctly read the output of the command.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
