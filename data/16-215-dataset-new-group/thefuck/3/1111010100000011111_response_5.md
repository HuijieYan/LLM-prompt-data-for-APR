## Analysis
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. However, it seems to be causing a recursive loop issue when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin `thefuck -v`.

## Error Location
The error is likely occurring because the `info` function is not handling the case where `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to a call to `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `info` function being called in a way that triggers a recursive loop, leading to a hanging state.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `info` function gets the version of the Fish shell to avoid triggering a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin `thefuck -v`.

## Correction
```python
# The correction to the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
