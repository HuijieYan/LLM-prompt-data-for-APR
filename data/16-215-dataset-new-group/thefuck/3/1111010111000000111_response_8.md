## Analysis:
The buggy function "info" in the Fish class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess. However, the command used to retrieve the version is incorrect, which causes the function to fail.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The command used in Popen to retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. The decoding and formatting of the retrieved version.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the command used in Popen to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect. It should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This discrepancy causes the test to fail and leads to the recursive loop described in the GitHub issue.

## Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, the command in Popen needs to be changed to 'fish --version' to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version. Additionally, the decoding of the retrieved version and the formatting should be handled appropriately.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```
