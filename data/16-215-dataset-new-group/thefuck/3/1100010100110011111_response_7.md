## The buggy function analysis
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` function to execute a command that retrieves the fish version, but it fails to parse the version correctly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual version.

The error message indicates that the function returns the version with the word "fish, version" included, leading to a failed assertion.

The GitHub issue indicates that the plugin is causing a recursive loop due to the `info` function.

## Potential error locations
The potential error is likely in the way the version is being extracted from the output of the `Popen` command. There might be an issue with the command itself or the parsing of the output.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the subprocess command not correctly parsing the fish version and including the string "fish, version" in the output. This is likely due to the command not being constructed properly or the output not being parsed correctly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the subprocess command to correctly retrieve the fish version and ensuring that the output is parsed correctly to remove any unnecessary text.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extracting only the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
