The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
- The use of `fish` with the `-c` flag, which may not return the correct version of the Fish shell.
- The incorrect assignment of the version value after extracting it from the subprocess.

The root cause of the bug is the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and the incorrect handling of subprocess output. The failing test specifically points to the incorrect output and how it's obtained.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be revised to use the proper command, and the subprocess output handling should be corrected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[2])
```

The corrected version of the function uses the correct command `fish --version` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. It also properly retrieves and formats the version from the subprocess output. This should resolve the issue and allow the test to pass.
