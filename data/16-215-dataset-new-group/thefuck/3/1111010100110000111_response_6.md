## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation:
The cause of the bug is that the original `info` function was attempting to parse the value of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, but it should have been using `fish --version` instead. This resulted in a mismatch between the expected and actual shell version strings, leading to the assertion failure in the test.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function uses `fish --version` to obtain the shell version and constructs the return value accordingly. This ensures that the correct version string is retrieved and compared to the expected value in the test.

By making this change, the corrected function now correctly retrieves the Fish Shell version and formats it as "Fish Shell {version}", resolving the initial bug and enabling the test to pass.

This fix also addresses the GitHub issue by correctly retrieving the Fish Shell version, resolving the recursive loop and potential hang caused by the original `info` function.
