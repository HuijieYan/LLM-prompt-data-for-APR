The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect extraction of the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The error message shows that the actual output includes the text "fish, version" followed by the version number, but the function is incorrectly extracting only the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly extract the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(', version ')[-1]  # Extract version number correctly
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version number from the command output and return the expected result.
