The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the incorrect command to get the version of the fish shell. The command should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to use the correct command to get the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case.
