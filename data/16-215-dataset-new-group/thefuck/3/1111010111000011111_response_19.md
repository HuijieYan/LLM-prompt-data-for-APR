The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect command being executed using Popen. The expected command to retrieve the version of fish shell is 'fish --version' but the current command is 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

The cause of the bug is that the info() function is not returning the correct version of the fish shell. This is causing a hang in the initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin due to a recursive loop as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the command executed by Popen should be changed to 'fish --version' to correctly retrieve the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this update, the info() function will correctly retrieve the version of the fish shell as expected. This will resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
