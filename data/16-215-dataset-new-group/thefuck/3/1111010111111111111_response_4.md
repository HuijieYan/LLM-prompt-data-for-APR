To fix the buggy function, we need to update the command that is run to retrieve the Fish shell version. The issue seems to be that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the wrong value, which causes the `info` function to return the incorrect version.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to change the command to `fish --version` which should provide the correct version of the Fish shell.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())  # Extracting only the version number
```
