The buggy function `info` in the class `Fish` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is currently not returning the expected output based on the failing test case and the GitHub issue. The issue is related to a recursive loop when using Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the `info` function in the `Fish` class does not properly capture the version information from the shell. This is evident from the failing test output, where the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. 

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly capture the version information from the shell and format it as `'Fish Shell <version>'`. 

To resolve the issue, we can update the `info` function in the `Fish` class to use a different command to capture the Fish shell version. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', version ')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `fish --version` command, we can correctly capture the version of the Fish shell without including the unnecessary text. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue with the recursive loop when using Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.
