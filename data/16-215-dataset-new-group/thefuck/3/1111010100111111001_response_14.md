The issue in the buggy function is that it's not correctly reading the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The expected output should be "fish, version 3.5.9" but the actual output is just "3.5.9", which doesn't match the expected value.

This is causing the `assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly read the output of the command and format it with the correct version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and format it as "Fish Shell 3.5.9", satisfying the expected output values.

The corrected function will pass the failing test case provided.
