The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Instead of simply using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to get the version, the function is returning the entire output of the command.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to correctly parse the version from the command output and then return the formatted string with the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the output of the command
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should correctly parse the version from the command output and return the formatted string with the version number. This should pass the failing test.
