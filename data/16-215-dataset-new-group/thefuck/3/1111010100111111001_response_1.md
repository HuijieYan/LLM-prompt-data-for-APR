The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly reading the version output from the shell command and formatting it into the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly reading the output of the shell command and using it to format the expected output. The test case is failing because the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" when it should be "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly read the version from the shell command and format it into the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version from "fish, version 3.5.9"
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This modified function reads the version output, splits it by the comma, and takes the second part which contains the version number. It then formats the output as "Fish Shell <version>".

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
