The issue with the `info` function in the `shells/fish.py` file is that it triggers a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This is because the `info` function attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess, which in turn triggers the `thefuck -v` command and causes a recursive loop.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `info` function to directly return the name and version of the shell without using a subprocess. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    return u'Fish Shell'
```

By returning a fixed string with the shell name and not attempting to invoke any subprocess, we avoid triggering the recursive loop issue when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

This change should resolve the recursive loop issue as reported in the GitHub issue.
