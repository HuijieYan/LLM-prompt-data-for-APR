To correct the buggy function, we need to fix the following issues:
1. The command used to get the fish version is incorrect. It should be `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `--version`.
2. The call to `Popen` should specify to use the shell to execute the command.

The corrected version of the `info` function is as follows:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen('echo $FISH_VERSION', shell=True,
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
