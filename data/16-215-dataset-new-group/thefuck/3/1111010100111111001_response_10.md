The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is not correctly extracting the version of the Fish shell. This is indicated by the error message, where the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to extract the version number. This is due to the incorrect formatting in the `info` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly parse the version number from the output of the command and format it into the correct string.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the 'info' function should correctly extract the version number from the output of the command and format it into the correct string. This should resolve the failing test case and provide the expected output.
