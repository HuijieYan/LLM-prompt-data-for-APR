The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command to get the version number. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the way the version number is extracted from the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2].replace(',', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command passed to Popen has been changed to `['fish', '--version']` to ensure the version number is explicitly returned. Additionally, we split the output by spaces, and then take the third element which corresponds to the version number. Finally, we remove any commas in the version number using the `replace` method.

This corrected version should now return the correct version number and pass the failing test.
