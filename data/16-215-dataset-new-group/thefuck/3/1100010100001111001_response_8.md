The bug in the provided function is that it is not capturing the entire version string from the shell command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is only capturing the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' without including the text 'fish, version'. This causes the version variable to only contain '3.5.9' instead of the expected value 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being run by Popen to include the 'fish_version' text. Additionally, we should use the communicate() method of the subprocess.Popen object to avoid potential deadlocks associated with the use of stdout.read().

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly capture the version string and return the expected output.
