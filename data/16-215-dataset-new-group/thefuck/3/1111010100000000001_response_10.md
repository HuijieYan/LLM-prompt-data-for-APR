## Analysis of the Buggy Function

The provided function `info` is a method of the `Fish` class. It is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module. The output of the command is then decoded and formatted to return the name and version of the fish shell.


## Potential Error Locations

1. The use of `Popen` without proper error handling.
2. Reading the output from the process without checking for potential errors.
3. Decoding the output without error handling.


## Cause of the Bug

The potential causes of the bug are:
- The `Popen` process may fail, but there is no error handling to capture the failure.
- The output may not be read correctly from the process, resulting in an empty output, causing an error during decoding.


## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

1. We need to implement error handling for the `Popen` process to capture any failure.
2. We should use a context manager to ensure the proper handling of the subprocess and its resources.
3. Error handling is necessary when reading and decoding the output from the subprocess.


## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            with Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL) as proc:
                output, _ = proc.communicate()
                if proc.returncode == 0:
                    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
                    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
                else:
                    raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(proc.returncode, proc.args)
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Error retrieving fish shell version: {e}'
```

In the corrected version, we use a `try-except` block to capture any exception that may occur during the subprocess execution. We also use a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure the proper handling of the subprocess and its resources. The output from the process is captured using `proc.communicate()` and error handling is implemented to check for the return code and decode the output. If any exception occurs during the process, an error message is returned.
