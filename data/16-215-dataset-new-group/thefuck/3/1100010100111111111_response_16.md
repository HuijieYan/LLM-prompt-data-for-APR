## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting the output to include the version number in the return string. The failing test reveals that the output is not being formatted as expected and is causing the assertion error.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output includes the string "fish, version 3.5.9" when it should only contain the version number "3.5.9".

The provided runtime and expected input/output values also confirm that the returned version string is incorrect.

The GitHub issue suggests that this buggy function is causing a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

## Bug Location
The cause of the bug is likely related to parsing the output of the command executed to retrieve the version of the fish shell. The function should only extract the version number from the output.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not correctly parsing the version number from the output of the command, which results in the incorrect formatting of the returned version string.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly extract and format the version number from the command output. This can be achieved by parsing the output, extracting just the version number, and then formatting it into the desired string format.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split()[-1]  # Extract the version number
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version, the output of the command is split based on spaces, and the last item (which should be the version number) is used to format the return string. This approach ensures that only the version number is included in the final output.
