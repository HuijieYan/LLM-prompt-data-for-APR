## Analysis
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a subprocess to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the function is not correctly capturing the output of the subprocess and formatting it to return the expected value.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The way the subprocess output is being captured and read.
2. The formatting of the returned value.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect reading of the subprocess output and the incorrect format of the returned value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly capture and read the output of the subprocess and then format it correctly to return the expected value.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function should now properly capture and read the output of the subprocess and format it to return the expected value.
