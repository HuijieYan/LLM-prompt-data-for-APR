# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
from typing import Generic
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code was caused by the incorrect command used to obtain the Fish shell version. The original code used `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, while the correct command should be `fish --version`. 

By making this change to the command, the corrected version of the `info` function can successfully obtain the Fish shell version and return it in the correct format.
