The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by using Popen to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the error message indicates that the version string includes the text "fish, version" which is not expected. This is causing the assertion error during the test.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the version string along with the text "fish, version" and the function is not correctly stripping this extra text from the version.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly parse the version string by removing the unwanted "fish, version" text.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function properly strips the unwanted text "fish, version" from the version string, and returns the expected result.
