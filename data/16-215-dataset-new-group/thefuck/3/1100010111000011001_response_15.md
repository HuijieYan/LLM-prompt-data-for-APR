The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it seems to be using the wrong command to fetch the version of the fish shell. The test is designed to pass the version "3.5.9" to the `info` function and expects it to return "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

The bug in the `info` function is in the Popen line where it uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to fetch the version of fish shell. This command is incorrect and should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to get the correct version of the fish shell.

Here is a corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the `info` function should pass the failing test and return "Fish Shell 3.5.9" as expected.
