The problem with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command used in the `Popen` call is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the correct command to get the Fish shell version is `fish --version`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test and return the expected Fish shell version.
