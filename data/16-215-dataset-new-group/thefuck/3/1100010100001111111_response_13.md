The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to get the Fish shell version using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' and then formatting the output. However, the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not providing the expected output and causing issues with the plugin.

To fix this, we will modify the command to simply 'fish --version' and then retrieve the version information from the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[2]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will execute 'fish --version' to retrieve the version information from the Fish shell and return it in the expected format. This fix should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
