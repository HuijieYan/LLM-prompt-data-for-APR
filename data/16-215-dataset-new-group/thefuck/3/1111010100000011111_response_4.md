## A fixed version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['/usr/bin/env', 'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used in the Popen call. The original command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` does not provide the full path to the fish shell, which causes a recursive loop as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to provide the full path to the fish shell in the Popen command. The fixed version of the function uses `/usr/bin/env fish` to get the full path to the fish shell.

This fix resolves the issue and provides the correct path to the fish shell for the Popen command.
