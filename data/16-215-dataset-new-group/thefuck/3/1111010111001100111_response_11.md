The buggy function `info` in the class `Fish` is failing because it is attempting to get the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it should be running the command `fish --version` instead.

The failing test `test_info` is not passing because the `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` is being set to a string that does not match the expected output of the `info` function.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and return the formatted string with the version.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the function will correctly fetch the Fish shell version and return the expected result. This should also resolve the GitHub issue related to oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11.
