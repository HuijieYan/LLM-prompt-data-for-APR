The issue with the `info` function is that it is not correctly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` when attempting to get the version of the Fish shell. The returned version includes the string "fish, version" which is not being handled properly, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly parse the version from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The modification involves splitting the output by ", " and extracting the second part, which contains the version number. This version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub reference.
