## The cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not correctly reading the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. This is resulting in an incorrect version string being returned, leading to the failing test.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `info` function correctly reads the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and formats it into the expected string.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With the corrected version of the function, the `info` method will correctly extract the version from the output of the command and format it into the expected string. This should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
