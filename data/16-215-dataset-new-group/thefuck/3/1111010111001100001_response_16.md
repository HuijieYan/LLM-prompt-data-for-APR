The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using the subprocess `Popen`. However, the test is failing because the command that is being run is not returning the expected version string.

The cause of the bug is that the command being run in the subprocess is `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version`. This discrepancy in the command being run is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being run in the subprocess to `['fish', '--version']` so that it matches the expected command in the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
