## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect command being passed to the `Popen` process, leading to the `proc.stdout.read()` not returning the expected version information. To fix the bug, we need to update the command being passed to the `Popen` process to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
