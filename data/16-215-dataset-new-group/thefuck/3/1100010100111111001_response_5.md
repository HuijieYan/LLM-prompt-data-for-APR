The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. However, the current implementation is not capturing the correct output, which is causing the failing test.

### Bug
The bug in the function `info` is that it is not capturing the correct output from the `Popen` command and is not formatting the output string properly.

The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly read and format the version string obtained from the `Popen` command.

### The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should properly capture the version and return the expected output.
