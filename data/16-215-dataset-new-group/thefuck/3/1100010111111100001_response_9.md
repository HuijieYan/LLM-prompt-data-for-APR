The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the fish shell version. This is causing the `info` function to return the wrong version of the fish shell, leading to the failing test.

The bug is caused by the use of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish shell version. This command does not provide the correct version format, which is why the test is failing.

To fix the bug, the command to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated to `fish --version`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
