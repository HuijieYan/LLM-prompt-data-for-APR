## Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin due to the use of `thefuck -v`. The `info` function calls `Popen` to run a command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error lies in the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop using the `info` function. The recursive loop is caused by the `proc` variable which may be responsible for the hang.

## Explanation of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information

The bug is causing a recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This recursive loop is triggered by the `info` function in the `fish.py` file due to the way it runs the command to determine the version of the Fish shell. This issue has been identified and a fix is on the way according to the GitHub issue reference.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `info` function in the `fish.py` file to avoid triggering the recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command. This may involve using a different approach to retrieve the version of the Fish shell or adding a condition to prevent the recursive loop.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    version, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `stderr` parameter of `Popen` has been set to `PIPE` to capture any error output. Additionally, the `communicate` method is used to capture the output and error streams from the process. This should prevent the recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
