The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' using the Popen function. However, it is not retrieving the correct version and is failing the test.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version'. This is causing the returned version to be incorrect, resulting in a failing test.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be updated to use the correct command 'fish --version' to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
