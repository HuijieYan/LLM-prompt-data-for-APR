The buggy function "info" in the file thefuck/shells/fish.py has a couple of issues that need to be fixed. The main issue is that it is not correctly parsing the version from the output of the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'. Additionally, the test case is expecting a specific format for the version number.

The cause of the bug is that the function "info" is not parsing the correct version from the output of the command. The failing test is expecting the version number without any additional text, and the function is returning the entire output of the command.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly parse the version number from the output of the command and return it in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the "info" function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should parse the version number correctly and return it in the expected format. This will fix the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
