The bug in the `info` function is that it is trying to read the version of the Fish shell using the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version'` as expected in the test.

Additionally, the test is setting the side effect for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the function is trying to read from `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This means that the side effect is not correctly simulating the behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell and match the test's expectations.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fixed version of the function, it should pass the failing test.
