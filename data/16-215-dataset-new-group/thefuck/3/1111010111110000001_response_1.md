The buggy function fails the test because it is not properly extracting the version number from the output of the `fish --version` command. The test expects the version number to be extracted correctly and formatted as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the current implementation does not satisfy this requirement.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version number is extracted from the output. The version number is currently extracted using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is incorrect. It should be extracted using the `fish --version` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command executed by Popen to `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the correct version number is extracted from the command output. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
