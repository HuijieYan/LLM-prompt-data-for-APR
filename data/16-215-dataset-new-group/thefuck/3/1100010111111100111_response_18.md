Based on the given information, the bug in the `info` function is related to the incorrect command used to retrieve the version from the Fish shell and the inaccurate formatting of the output.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the version from the Fish shell. The test case includes a sample output that shows the correct format as "fish, version 3.5.9\n". However, the command being executed in the `info` function is "echo $FISH_VERSION", which does not match the expected output format. This leads to the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the version from the Fish shell needs to be used, and the output format should match the expected format in the test case.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the correct command "fish --version" to retrieve the version information from the Fish shell. Then, we extract the version from the output by splitting the string at the comma and taking the second part, which represents the version number.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub context.
