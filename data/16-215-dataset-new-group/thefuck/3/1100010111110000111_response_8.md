The problem with the `info` function is that it retrieves the Fish shell version with the wrong command and does not handle the version output correctly.

The `Popen` call in the `info` function uses the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to retrieve the Fish shell version, but the test expects the command to be `fish --version`. This explains why the test provides a version string with "fish, version" included, as opposed to just the version number.

To fix this bug, the `Popen` call in the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command to retrieve the version and then parse it to extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', ')[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this fix, the `info` function retrieves the Fish shell version using the correct command (`fish --version`), and then extracts and returns only the version number. This should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported in GitHub.
