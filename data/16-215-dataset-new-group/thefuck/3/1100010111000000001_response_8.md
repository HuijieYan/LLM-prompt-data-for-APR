The potential error in the `info` function seems to be the command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` call is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the actual version of the Fish shell. Instead, the correct command to get the version is `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, update the `Popen` call to use the correct command `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
