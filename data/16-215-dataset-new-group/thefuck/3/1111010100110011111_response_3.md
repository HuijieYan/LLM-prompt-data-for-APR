The cause of the bug in the `info` function is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the output along with the string "Fish, version" which is not expected. This is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual output, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the command to remove the string "Fish, version" from the output. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip())
```

By replacing 'fish, version' with an empty string in the `version` variable, we ensure that the output only contains the version number, which aligns with the expected output. This fix will resolve the failing test and correct the behavior of the `info` function.
