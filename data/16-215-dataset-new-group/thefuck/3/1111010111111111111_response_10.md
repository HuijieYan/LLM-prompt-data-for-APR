The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it's trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the correct command to get the Fish shell version is `fish --version`. This is causing the function to return an incorrect version and fail the test.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the `info` function to run the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
