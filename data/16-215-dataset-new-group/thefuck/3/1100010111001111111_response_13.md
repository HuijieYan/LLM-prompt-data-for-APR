## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
- The original function was using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version number, which was causing the recursive loop issue.
- The corrected version now uses `fish --version` to get the version number instead of relying on the environmental variable, resolving the recursive loop issue.
- The `--version` flag is the standard way to get the version information for most command-line tools, so using it is a more robust approach.
- Additionally, the correction aligns the function with the expected input/output values from the failing test case, ensuring that it will pass the test.
