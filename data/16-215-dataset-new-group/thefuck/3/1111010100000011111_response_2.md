The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the fish shell by executing a command and reading the output. However, it is not properly handling the Popen process and is not returning the correct version information.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Improper handling of the Popen process and its output.
2. Incorrect formatting of the returned version information.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly capturing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and is not properly decoding the output to obtain the version information. This results in an incorrect version string being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Popen process is properly handled, the stdout is read correctly, and the version information is decoded and formatted accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use the `communicate` method of the `proc` object to read the stdout and stderr streams, which ensures that the process is properly handled and the output is captured.
2. We then decode the stdout to obtain the version information and return it in the correct format.

This correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the function returns the correct version information for the fish shell.
