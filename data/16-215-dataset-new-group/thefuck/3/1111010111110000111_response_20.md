Potential Error Locations:
- The `Popen` call with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` may not be returning the expected version of Fish Shell.

Cause of the Bug:
The failing test is due to the fact that when the `shell.info()` function is called, it returns 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This is likely due to the incorrect parsing of the version from the `Popen` call in the `info` function.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `Popen` call to ensure that the correct version is being captured from the shell environment.
2. Update the decoding and stripping process to ensure that the version is correctly extracted.
3. Return the version string in the correct format containing 'Fish Shell' followed by the captured version.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, we have modified the `Popen` call to use `['fish', '--version']` instead of the previous command. We also split the result at the comma and strip any leading or trailing spaces to ensure that the correct version is captured. Finally, we return the version in the format 'Fish Shell <version>'.
