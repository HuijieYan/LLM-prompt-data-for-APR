The bug in the `info` function is causing the unexpected assertion error in the test. The function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in a specific format, but it is not correctly handling the output from the `Popen` call and formatting the version.

The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` call is returning a bytes object with the shell name and the version, and the function is not correctly extracting just the version from it.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly handle the output of the `Popen` call and extract just the version from it. We can use string manipulation to achieve this.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(", version ")[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function correctly extracts the version number from the output of the `Popen` call and returns it in the expected format. The test should now pass without any assertion errors.
