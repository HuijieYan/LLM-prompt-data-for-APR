### The cause of the bug
The bug in the `info` function arises from incorrectly parsing the version of the Fish shell from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, leading to a mismatch when compared with the expected version in the test.

The expected version from the command should be `'3.5.9'`, but due to the incorrect command being used to get the version, the actual version becomes `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. This mismatch causes the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the command being used to extract the Fish shell version needs to be corrected. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, the `--version` flag should be used, as this will return the correct version format. Additionally, the decoding and stripping should be adjusted for the new command.

### The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test with the correct version format and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
