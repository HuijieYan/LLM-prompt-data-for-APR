The issue with the current code is that it is not correctly capturing the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' in the fish shell. The output of the command includes the word "fish" which is missing in the current implementation. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the string format to include the word "fish" before the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```
