The cause of the bug is that the `info()` function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The version number extracted includes the string "fish, version" which is not expected.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the command executed by Popen to extract only the version number without the prefix "fish, version".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly extract the version number and return "Fish Shell 3.5.9" as expected.
