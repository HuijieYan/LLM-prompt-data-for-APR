## The fixed version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The buggy function was using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the fish shell version, which was not returning the expected output. This was causing the `shell.info()` method to fail the test. The expected version number was not matching the actual version number, resulting in an assertion error.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the fish shell version was changed to `['fish', '--version']` which ensures that the correct version information is obtained. This change also aligns with the expected call arguments in the failing test.

With the fixed function, the test will pass as the expected and actual version numbers will match, resolving the assertion error.
