The issue with the buggy function is that it's not correctly reading the version of the Fish shell. The expected value of the version is "fish, version 3.5.9" but the buggy function is returning just the version number "3.5.9". This discrepancy is causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly parse the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we replaced the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` with `fish --version` to correctly retrieve the shell version information. This change should resolve the failing test and match the expected input/output values.
