The issue with the buggy function is that it is not returning the expected version string for the Fish shell. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, it should use `fish --version` to get the correct version string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
