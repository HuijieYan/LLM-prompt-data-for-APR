The issue with the buggy function `info` in `shells/fish.py` is that it is trying to extract the Fish version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This causes the `info` function to return an unexpected version string, leading to a failing test.

To fix this bug, the `Popen` call should be modified to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This will return the correct version string, aligning with the expected value in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the expected version string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', and the failing test should pass. This fix also aligns with the issue reported in GitHub, addressing the problem with the Fish Shell initialization while using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
