# The cause of the bug
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the file `fish.py` causes the function to return the incorrect version string which leads to the failing test. The cause of the bug is due to the use of the incorrect command in the `Popen` call, which results in the wrong version string being retrieved and compared with the expected version string. The use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the `Popen` call is incorrect as it returns only the major version, and the expected version contains both 'fish' and the actual version.

# Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the command passed to the `Popen` call needs to be updated to `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the complete version string including 'fish' and the actual version. This will ensure that the correct version string is compared with the expected version string and the failing test is passed. 

# The corrected function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(" ")[2])
```

The updated `Popen` command retrieves the complete version string including 'fish' and the actual version. The returned version is then split to extract the actual version and format it into the correct version string before it is returned.
