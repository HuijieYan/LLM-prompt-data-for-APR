The cause of the bug is that the command being executed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is different from the one being checked against in the test. This is evidenced by the error message, which shows that the output of the command includes the text "fish, version" which causes the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version needs to be changed to align with the command being checked in the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the command to retrieve the version of Fish shell has been updated to match the one being checked in the test, resolving the bug.
