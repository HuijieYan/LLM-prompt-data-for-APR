## Fixing the bug
The issue is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The failing test indicates that the command used is `fish --version` while the buggy function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The correct command to retrieve the version of Fish shell is `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
