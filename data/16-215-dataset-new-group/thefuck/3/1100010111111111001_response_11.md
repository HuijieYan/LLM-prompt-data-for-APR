The issue in the `info` function seems to be related to the command being passed to Popen and the extraction of the version. 

The failing test indicates that the function is not returning 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected, and the error message suggests that the actual output includes the text "fish, version" which is not expected.

To fix this, the command passed to Popen should be changed to get the fish version using `fish --version` command.

Also, the way the version is being extracted from the output of the command needs to be modified.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split()[-1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
