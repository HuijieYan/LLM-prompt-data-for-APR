## The cause of the bug

The `info` function in `Fish` class is currently using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version. However, the actual version output includes additional text `fish, version`, and this leads to a discrepancy between the expected and actual version.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to get the Fish shell version to `fish --version`, which will return the version information in the expected format. Then, we can parse the output to retrieve only the version number.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split()[-1]  # Get only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
