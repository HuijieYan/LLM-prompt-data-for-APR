The bug in the provided function is that it is not handling the subprocess properly and is not waiting for the process to finish before reading the output.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` where it is trying to read the output of the subprocess directly without waiting for it to finish.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to read the output from the subprocess before it has completed.

To fix the bug, we should wait for the subprocess to finish before reading the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, we have added `proc.communicate()` to wait for the subprocess to finish before reading the output. This should fix the bug.
