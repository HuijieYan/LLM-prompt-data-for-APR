The bug in the given function is that it is not properly reading the output of the Popen process. It is trying to read from `proc.stdout`, but it is actually a MagicMock object and not the actual output of the command.

To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to finish and then read the output. We can do this using the `communicate` method of the Popen object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly wait for the process to finish and then read the output from `proc.communicate()` instead of directly accessing `proc.stdout`. This should fix the bug and provide the correct version of the Fish shell.
