The bug in the provided function is that it is using the `Popen` process to capture the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it does not properly wait for the process to finish before reading the output. This can lead to the `proc.stdout.read()` reading an empty string if the process has not finished executing.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will properly wait for the process to finish before reading the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout`, we ensure that the process has finished and the output is properly captured before decoding and returning the version string. This should fix the bug and prevent the function from returning an empty string or incorrect version.
