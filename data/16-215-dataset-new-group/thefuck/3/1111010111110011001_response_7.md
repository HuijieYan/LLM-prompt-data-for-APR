The bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell. The `Popen` command should use `['fish', '--version']` to get the version information, but instead it is currently using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This results in the version being retrieved in an incorrect format, causing the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be updated to `['fish', '--version']` to properly retrieve the version of the fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` method should now pass the failing test and return the expected version of the fish shell.
