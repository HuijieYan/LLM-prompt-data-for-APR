### Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting the output to return the shell's name and version. The failing test is expecting the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but instead receiving 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This indicates that the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is returning additional information along with the version number.

### Potential error locations:
1. The command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` may not be returning the version number in the expected format.
2. The parsing of the command output to extract the version number for formatting might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just the version number. This causes the formatting of the version to include the additional 'fish' and ', version' from the command output.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Modify the command to retrieve only the version number without any additional information.
2. Update the parsing of the command output to correctly extract the version number.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(" ")[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the updated code, the corrected function retrieves the version number using the command `fish --version` and extracts only the version number for formatting. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
