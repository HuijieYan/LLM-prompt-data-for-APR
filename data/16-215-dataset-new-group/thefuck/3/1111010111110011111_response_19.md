The potential error locations within the buggy function are the Popen call and the handling of the output from the subprocess.

The cause of the bug is that the function 'info' does not correctly parse the output of the subprocess to obtain the version of the Fish shell, leading to an incorrect result when compared to the expected value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen call to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and correctly parse the output to retrieve the version string.

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# Update the imports to include StringIO
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
from io import StringIO

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version of the 'info' function, the subprocess is called with the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell, and the output is parsed to extract the version string. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
