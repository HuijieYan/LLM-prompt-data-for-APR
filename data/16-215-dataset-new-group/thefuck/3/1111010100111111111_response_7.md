The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then formatting the output as "Fish Shell {version}". However, the function is not handling the actual shell version string correctly, leading to an assertion error in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly reading the version string from the command output. The actual output from the command is "fish, version 3.5.9" which is not being handled properly by the function.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse the output of the command and extract the version string before formatting it as "Fish Shell {version}".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[-1]  # Extract version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly extract the version from the command output and format it as "Fish Shell {version}". This will resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it will address the issue posted on GitHub by correctly handling the Fish shell version retrieval.
