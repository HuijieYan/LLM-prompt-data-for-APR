To fix the bug in the `info` function, we need to make sure that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is correct and that the reading and decoding of the stdout are done properly. 

It seems like the command used in the Popen call is incorrect, as it should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
