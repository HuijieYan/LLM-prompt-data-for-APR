The buggy function `info` is not handling the subprocess `Popen` correctly. It is not waiting for the process to finish and directly reads from the stdout, which may result in an incomplete or empty output.

To fix the bug, the function should wait for the process to finish and then read the output from stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we added the `proc.wait()` line to ensure that the function waits for the subprocess to finish before reading the output from `stdout`. This should fix the bug and ensure the correct output is returned.
