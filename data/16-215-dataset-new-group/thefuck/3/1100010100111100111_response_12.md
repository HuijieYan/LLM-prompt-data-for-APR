## Correction

The bug within the provided function is caused by the read value containing the entire string "fish, version 3.5.9\n" instead of just the version number "3.5.9".

Below is the corrected version of the function, computing the value of 'version' using a split operation on the output of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` and selecting the second item of the resultant list.

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By utilizing the split operation, we can extract the version number from the entire string. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
