## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the use of `proc.stdout.read()` is causing the function to hang and create a recursive loop in certain situations, such as when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Bug
The bug is caused by using `proc.stdout.read()` which can cause the function to hang and trigger a recursive loop.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the `proc.communicate()` method should be used instead of `proc.stdout.read()` to avoid hanging and potential recursive loops.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
