The issue with the current function is that it is causing a recursive loop in Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin when using the command `thefuck -v`. This is due to the `info` function in the file `shells/fish.py` causing a hang during Fish Shell initialization.

The cause of this bug is that the `info` function is executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess and reading the output, which triggers a recursive loop when used with `thefuck -v`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `info` function to check if it's being called from the `thefuck -v` command and bypass the subprocess call in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self, check_thefuck=False):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if check_thefuck:
        return "Fish Shell"  # Return a dummy value when called from thefuck -v
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we added a new parameter `check_thefuck` to the `info` function, which defaults to `False`. When set to `True`, it returns a dummy value "Fish Shell" instead of executing the subprocess. This allows the function to bypass the problematic subprocess call when called from `thefuck -v`, resolving the recursive loop issue.
