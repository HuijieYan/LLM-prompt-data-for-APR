Based on the given buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue is with the Popen call in the info function. The failing test indicates that 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' is being returned instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', and the runtime values also show that the version string is not being correctly extracted from the Popen call.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Popen call is not correct, and it should be `fish --version` to get the correct version information.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the correct version information. Also, the decoding and stripping of the version string from the stdout should be updated to match the returning string format.

Here's the corrected version of the info function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the returned string
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the info function should now correctly return the version of the Fish shell, and the failing test case should pass.
