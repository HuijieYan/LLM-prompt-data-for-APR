The buggy function fails to return the correct version of the fish shell. The `Popen` call uses the incorrect command to retrieve the version (`echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`). As a result, the function returns the incorrect shell version which leads to a failing test. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the `Popen` call to use the correct command for retrieving the shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

This corrected version uses the correct command (`fish --version`) to retrieve the version of the fish shell. It also processes the version string to extract the version number and returns the expected output. This will allow the function to pass the failing test with the correct shell version.
