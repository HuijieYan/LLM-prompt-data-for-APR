The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` method to run a command in the fish shell and extract the version. However, the error message and the runtime values show that the returned version string includes the "fish, version" prefix, which is not expected.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` returns the version along with the "fish, version" prefix, which is not handled properly in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract the version without the prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", ")[1]  # Extracting the version without the prefix
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string and extracting the second part (after the comma and space), we can ensure that the returned version does not contain the "fish, version" prefix.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
