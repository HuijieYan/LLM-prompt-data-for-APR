The bug in the `info` function is causing the failing test because the function is not correctly parsing the FISH_VERSION environment variable to get the version of the Fish shell. Instead, it is trying to run the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and parse the output, which is not consistent with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can directly access the FISH_VERSION environment variable and return the version from there.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
