The bug in the provided function is that it is not capturing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command correctly. The function then tries to decode the output of `proc.stdout.read()` as UTF-8 and return it as the version of the Fish shell.

The issue here is that `proc.stdout.read()` returns a bytes object, not a string, so decoding it as UTF-8 may result in an incorrect version string.

To fix this bug, we should first decode the output of `proc.stdout.read()` as UTF-8 and then convert it to a string before returning.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
        version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly capture and return the version of the Fish shell.
