The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` method. The bug seems to be in the command being passed to `Popen` and in processing its output. The failing test is expecting the version string '3.5.9' to be returned, but currently it is not being formatted correctly.

The bug seems to be in the command being passed to `Popen`. In the test function, the call to `Popen` with `['fish', '--version']` is not matching the call that is made in the `info` function, which is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. Additionally, the `stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not handling the output of the command correctly, as it is expecting to read 'fish, version 3.5.9\n' and extract the version number.

To fix the bug, the command sent to `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to match the test, and the way the output is processed should be updated to correctly extract the version number from the output and format it as 'Fish Shell version_number'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version of the code, it should pass the failing test.
