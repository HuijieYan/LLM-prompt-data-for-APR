Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is the incorrect command being executed to get the Fish shell version. The `Popen` call is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is checking for the command `['fish', '--version']`. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expected command in the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected function, the provided failing test should pass.
