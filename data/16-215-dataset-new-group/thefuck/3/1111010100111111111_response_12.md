The issue with the buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is that it is not returning the expected version of Fish shell. The `info()` function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it does not handle the output correctly, resulting in an incorrect version being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the `info()` function does not properly handle the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Instead of directly using `Popen().stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, the function should capture the standard output of the process using `communicate()`.

To fix the bug, the `info()` function should be modified to handle the output of the command correctly by using `communicate()` to obtain the process output. 

Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info()` function will properly obtain the version of the Fish shell and return the expected output.

This fix will resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin with the thefuck plugin.
