The issue here is that the returned version from the subprocess is not being handled correctly. The code is simply taking the output of the subprocess and formatting it into the phrase "Fish Shell {}".format(version). This doesn't handle the case where the version string includes the "fish, version" prefix.

To fix this, we can modify the code to extract the version number from the output of the subprocess and then format it into the desired string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly extract the version number from the subprocess output and format it into the desired string.

This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
