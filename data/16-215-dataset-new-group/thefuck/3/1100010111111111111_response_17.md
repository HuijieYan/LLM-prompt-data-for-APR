The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file is due to the incorrect command used to extract the Fish shell version and its incorrect formatting.

The function currently uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell. However, the correct command to get the version is `fish --version`. Additionally, the version string extracted from the command output is not formatted correctly to match the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command and format the version string accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Extract version string
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extract and format the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract and format the Fish shell version, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values. This fix should also resolve the GitHub issue related to handling the Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
