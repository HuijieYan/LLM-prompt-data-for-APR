The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in a specific format. However, the Popen command is not properly constructed to get the version information, causing the function to fail the test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The Popen command is using the wrong argument to retrieve the version.
2. There might be an issue with decoding the version information.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command is not correctly fetching the version information from the Fish shell. It is also failing to decode the retrieved information properly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the Popen command to accurately fetch the version of the Fish shell and ensure that the retrieved information is decoded correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the Popen command now uses `--version` as the argument to retrieve the version, and the retrieved version is properly decoded and formatted before being returned. This version should pass the failing test.
