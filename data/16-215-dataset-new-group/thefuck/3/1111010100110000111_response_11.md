## The potential error location
The potential error in the function lies in the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved. The function is currently reading the entire string 'fish, version 3.5.9\n', instead of just the version number.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the version number from the output of the command. The function is returning the entire string 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the function to parse the version number from the output of the command, instead of returning the entire string. This can be achieved by applying string manipulation or regular expressions to extract the version number.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(', version ')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the function, the version number is extracted using the `split` method on the `version_output` string, which splits the string at ', version ' and returns the version number. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
