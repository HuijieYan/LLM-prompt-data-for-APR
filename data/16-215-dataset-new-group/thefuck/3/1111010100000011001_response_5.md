The bug in the `info` function is that it is not correctly fetching the version of the Fish shell. The Popen process is not being handled properly, leading to incorrect reading of the version.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` object is not being used correctly to capture the output of the command. Instead of directly calling `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output, we should use `communicate()` or `proc.stdout.read()` function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `info` function to use `communicate()` to read the output of the command and decode it properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
