The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to get the fish shell version. The function is currently using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is not the correct way to get the fish shell version. Additionally, the function is reading the output of the process using `proc.stdout.read()` instead of `communicate()`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the fish shell version, and to read the output of the process using `communicate()`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should now correctly return the version of the fish shell and pass the failing test.
