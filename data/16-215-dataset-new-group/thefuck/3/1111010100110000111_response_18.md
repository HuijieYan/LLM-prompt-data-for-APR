The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class arises from the way the version string is extracted. The error message shows that the extracted version string includes the text "fish, version" which is not expected. This indicates that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not returning the expected output format.

To fix the bug, the command used to extract the version string must be modified so that it returns only the version number without any additional text. Additionally, the output from the command needs to be decoded properly before it is used.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This version of the function splits the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command by the comma and takes the last part, which should be just the version number. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the correct version string.
