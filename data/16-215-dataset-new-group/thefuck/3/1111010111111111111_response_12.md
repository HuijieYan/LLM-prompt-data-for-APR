The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `thefuck/shells/fish.py` file is caused by the incorrect command being passed to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `Popen` call should use the command `['fish', '-v']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` as mentioned in the failing test. This means the current implementation is not correctly retrieving the Fish shell version.

To fix the bug, update the `info` function to use the correct command for retrieving the Fish shell version. This will ensure that the function retrieves the version and formats it correctly, producing the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With the correction, the `info` function retrieves the Fish shell version using the correct command `['fish', '--version']`, resulting in the expected output.
