The potential error in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the subprocess Popen object and its stdout. This could lead to the function returning unexpected values or errors.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the Popen object and its stdout. The read() method is not being called on the stdout attribute, which means that the version variable is not getting the expected value.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the Popen object and its stdout attribute to retrieve the version value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the communicate() method of the Popen object, the function can properly retrieve the stdout value and decode it to get the version information. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
