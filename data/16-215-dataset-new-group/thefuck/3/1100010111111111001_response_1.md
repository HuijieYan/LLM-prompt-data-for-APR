The bug in the function `info` is caused by the incorrect command passed to the `Popen` function, which is `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This causes the incorrect version to be extracted from the output.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command passed to `Popen` so that it matches the command that the test is expecting, which is `['fish', '--version']`. This will ensure that the correct version is extracted from the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```
