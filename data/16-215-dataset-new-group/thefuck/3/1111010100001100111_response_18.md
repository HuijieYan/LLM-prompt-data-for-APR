The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The use of Popen without handling the process wait and potential errors.
2. Reading the stdout of the process without checking for potential errors or closing the process.

The cause of the bug is that the function `info` is not handling the Popen process correctly, leading to potential issues with hanging processes and recursive loops.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the Popen process by waiting for the process to finish and handling any potential errors. Additionally, it should close the process after reading the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            raise RuntimeError(f'Error running command: {stderr.decode("utf-8")}')

        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        proc.terminate()  # Terminate the process
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we have used `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and capture the stdout and stderr. Then, we check the return code for any errors and raise an exception if necessary. Finally, we close the process using `proc.terminate()` to prevent any hanging processes.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
