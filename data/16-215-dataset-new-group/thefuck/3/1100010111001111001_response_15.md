The buggy function has a few issues that need to be fixed:

1. The command passed to Popen is incorrect, it should be ['fish', '--version'] instead of ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'].
2. The function is not handling the case when the Popen subprocess fails to execute properly.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen needs to be corrected and error handling needs to be added to handle subprocess failures.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        return u'Fish Shell version could not be determined'
```

With this correction, the function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and handle any errors that may occur during the subprocess execution. This should make the function pass the failing test.
