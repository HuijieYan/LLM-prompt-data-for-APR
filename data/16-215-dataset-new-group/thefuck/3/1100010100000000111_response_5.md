## Analysis
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is used to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the GitHub issue indicates that when using the `thefuck -v` command with Oh-My-Fish plugin, it triggers a recursive loop because of the `Fish.info()` function. This suggests that the `info` function is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `info` function are the use of Popen without properly waiting for the process to complete, and the command that is being executed.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `info` function triggering a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used with Oh-My-Fish plugin. This is likely due to the way the Popen command is being used, and the command being executed might also be contributing to the issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to use subprocess.run to properly wait for the process to complete, and we may also need to change the command being executed to avoid the recursive loop. Additionally, we should consider the specific issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin and how it interacts with the `thefuck -v` command.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to complete
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have added `proc.wait()` after the `Popen` command to properly wait for the process to complete. Additionally, we may need to further investigate the specific issues related to the Oh-My-Fish plugin and the `thefuck -v` command that triggers the recursive loop, as these interactions may require more specific changes or workarounds.
