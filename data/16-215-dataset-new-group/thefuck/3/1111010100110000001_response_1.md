To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the output of the Popen command is parsed correctly to extract the version number of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the output is being processed incorrectly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual version numbers.

We can fix this by modifying the `info` function to correctly parse the version number from the output of the Popen command. We will use regular expressions to extract the version number and then format it as the required output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
import re

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_match = re.search(r'version (\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', output)
        if version_match:
            version = version_match.group(1)
            return f'Fish Shell {version}'
        else:
            return 'Fish Shell'  # Default in case version is not found
```

With this modification, the `info` function will correctly extract the version number from the output of the Popen command and format it as the expected output. This should fix the bug and make the test pass.
