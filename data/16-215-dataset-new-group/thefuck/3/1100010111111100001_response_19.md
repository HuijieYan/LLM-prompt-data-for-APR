The problem in the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version.

The cause of the bug:
The function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version, but it should be using the command `fish --version`. This is why the test is failing, as it expects the version number retrieved using the correct command.

To fix the bug:
Change the command from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version` in the Popen call.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
