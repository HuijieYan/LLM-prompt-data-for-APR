The issue in the `info` function is with the command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell. The `Popen` command is running `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is not the correct command to get the version. This is causing the discrepancy in the expected and actual values.

To fix this bug, we need to change the command used to retrieve the fish shell version in the `info` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the `Popen` command now runs `fish --version` to accurately fetch the fish shell version. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
