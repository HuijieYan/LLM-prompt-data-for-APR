## Analysis
The function is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. Based on the error message, it seems that the output of the command is not being correctly retrieved from the process and is leading to an extra text being included in the version string.

## Identified Bug
The bug is likely in the way that the function is reading the output of the command. It seems that it is reading the additional 'fish, version' in the output, which is not expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the output from the Popen process. The function is not correctly extracting just the version number from the output.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the output of the Popen process is read to only capture the version number and not the entire output.

## The corrected function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
