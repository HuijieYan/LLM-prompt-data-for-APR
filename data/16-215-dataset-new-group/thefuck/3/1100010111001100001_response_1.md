The buggy function has a few issues. First, it is executing the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version' to get the version of the shell. Additionally, the test is mocking the wrong command, as it is mocking 'fish, version 3.5.9\n' instead of 'fish --version'.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not fetching the correct version of the Fish shell, and the test is also asserting against the wrong command result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' and also update the assertion in the test to match the correct command result.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell.
