## The cause of the bug
The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing its output. The issue on GitHub suggests that running `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop because of the `Fish.info()` function. This implies that the current implementation of `Fish.info()` is causing the recursive loop, potentially due to the way it is fetching the version of the shell.

The `Popen` function is used to run the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capture its output. However, the usage of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to read the output from the process may be the cause of the recursive loop.

## Strategy to fix the bug
To fix the bug, we should refactor the `info` function to properly handle the subprocess and capture the version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop. A potential solution would be to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read the output and also handle any potential errors that may arise from the subprocess.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
