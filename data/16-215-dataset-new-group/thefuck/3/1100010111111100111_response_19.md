### Bug fix strategy
The issue is caused by the fact that the buggy function `info` is invoking the `fish` command with the `-c` flag and the `echo` command, which is causing it to return the output including the command name. To fix this, the command being run needs to be changed to `fish --version`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
