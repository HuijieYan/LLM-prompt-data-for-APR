The issue in the buggy function lies in how it retrieves the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The error message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output includes the string 'fish, version' which is not expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` object is being mocked in the test, and the `stdout.read` attribute is returning the unexpected value 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract the version number correctly from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` by `,` and grabbing the second part, we can correctly extract the version number '3.5.9' from the output 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

With this change, the `info` function should now return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected and pass the failing test.
