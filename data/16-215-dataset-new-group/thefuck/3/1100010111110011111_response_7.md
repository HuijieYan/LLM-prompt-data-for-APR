The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not fetching the Fish version correctly, resulting in the incorrect return value.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the Fish shell is not correctly fetching the Fish version, which leads to the failing test and the assertion error. The expected input values are the Popen object and the expected version, which is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to fetch the Fish version and ensure that the correct version is extracted from the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[2])
```

This corrected version uses the '--version' flag to fetch the Fish version, and then extracts the version number from the output and returns the expected result.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
