Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The command being executed in the Popen call is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is checking for `['fish', '--version']`, which seems to be a mismatch.
2. There may be issues with the reading of the stdout from the Popen object.

Cause of the bug:
The bug appears to be caused by the mismatch between the command being executed in the Popen call and the command being checked in the test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to execute the correct command, and the reading of stdout from the Popen object should be handled correctly.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function uses the correct command `['fish', '--version']` in the Popen call to get the shell version. This should pass the failing test.
