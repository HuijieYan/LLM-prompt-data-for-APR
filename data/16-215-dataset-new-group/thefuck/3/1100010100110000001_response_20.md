## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `info` function is returning the version of the shell in a slightly different format than expected, leading to the assertion error.

## Identified Bug
The bug is likely due to the way the output of the process is being read and decoded, resulting in the unexpected format of the version string.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that `proc.stdout.read()` returns `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` instead of just `3.5.9`. This causes the assertion error in the test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly extract and format the version string from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

## The corrected version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version from the output using a simple split operation
    version = version.split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
