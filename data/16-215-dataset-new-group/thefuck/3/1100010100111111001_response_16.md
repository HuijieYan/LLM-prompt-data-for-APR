The bug in the `info` function is that it is not correctly capturing the version string from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Instead, it captures the version string from the output of `Popen` which is not the desired behavior. This causes the function to return the incorrect version string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to capture the version string from the correct output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

The modification involves splitting the version string using the comma as the delimiter and returning the second part of the split string, which is the actual version number.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and return the expected output.
