## Buggy Function Analysis
1. The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell).
2. It uses the `Popen` function to run the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capture the output.
3. The test case `test_info` mocks the `Popen` function and expects the output to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
4. The error message shows that the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' which doesn't match the expected output.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` may not be correctly capturing the Fish shell version.
2. The processing of the captured output from `Popen` may be incorrect, leading to the wrong output.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect processing of the captured output from the `Popen` function. The function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output, leading to an unexpected format for the shell version.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by correctly extracting and formatting the version number from the output of the `Popen` function.

## Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')
    version_line = output.splitlines()[0]  # Get the first line of the output
    version = version_line.split()[-1]  # Extract the version number from the line
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly capture the Fish shell version and format it as 'Fish Shell {version}'. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test case.
