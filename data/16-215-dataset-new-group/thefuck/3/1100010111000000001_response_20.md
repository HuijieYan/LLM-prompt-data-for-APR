The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Using the wrong command to retrieve the fish version.
2. Using the wrong command to call the Popen object.

The cause of the bug is that the function is using the wrong command to retrieve the fish version, and it's not reading the correct output.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct command to retrieve the fish version, and read the output from the Popen object correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", ")[1]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should be able to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
