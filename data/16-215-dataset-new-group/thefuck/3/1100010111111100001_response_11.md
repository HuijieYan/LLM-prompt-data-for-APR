The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then parsing the result. However, the test is failing because the returned version is prefixed with "fish, version".

The potential error location is the line that retrieves the version from the stdout of the process:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the version with an extra prefix "fish, version".

To fix the bug, we can modify the command being executed to just `fish --version`, which will give us the version of the fish shell without any additional prefixes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
