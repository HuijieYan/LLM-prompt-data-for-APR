The bug in the `info` function lies in the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version, as well as the incorrect decoding of the output.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, as it should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, the decoding of the output using `.decode('utf-8')` is unnecessary as the output is already in the correct format.

To fix the bug, the command to retrieve the Fish shell version should be changed to `fish --version` and the decoding of the output should be removed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().strip().decode('utf-8')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
