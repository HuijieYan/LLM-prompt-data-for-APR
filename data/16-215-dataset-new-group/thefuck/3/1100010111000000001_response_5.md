The potential error in the `info` function is that it is using the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version'`, which is what the test is expecting. This causes the `Popen` call in the `info` function to return an incorrect version of the shell.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be modified to use `'fish --version'` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, the decoding and stripping of the version should be handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish Shell, and the failing test should pass successfully.
