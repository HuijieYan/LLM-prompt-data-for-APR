## The analysis of the bug and its relationship with the test code, error message, expected input/output values, and GitHub issue

Based on the provided information:
1. The `info` function in `fish.py` is designed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command on the Fish shell and retrieving the version.
2. The failing test sets up a mock `Popen` object to simulate the output of the `fish` command and then asserts that the `info` function returns the expected version and further inspects the call to `Popen`.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails because the actual output contains extra text (`'fish, version'`) that is not present in the expected output (`'3.5.9'`).
4. The issue on GitHub indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop in the `info` function due to the way it retrieves the version.

## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function

The issue likely lies within the `info` function where the command output is not being processed correctly, resulting in extra text being included in the version string.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function retrieves the entire output of the `fish` command without filtering out the unnecessary text, leading to the extra text being included in the version string, causing the assertion to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to extract only the version number from the command output, ensuring that it matches the expected format.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the function, it now correctly retrieves and formats the version number from the output of the `fish --version` command, ensuring that it matches the expected format and resolves the issue described on GitHub.
