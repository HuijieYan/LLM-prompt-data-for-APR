The issue with the buggy function is that it's trying to get the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting it to use the command `fish --version`. This causes the test to fail as the actual command being used does not match the expected command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version, which is `fish --version`. Additionally, the function should handle the command execution properly to avoid any potential issues.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and should pass the failing test.
