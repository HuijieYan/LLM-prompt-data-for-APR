There are a few potential issues with the provided function:

1. The function uses MagicMock objects, which are used for mocking and testing, but not for actual subprocess handling.

2. The command used to retrieve the fish version may not be correct.

3. The format of the returned string seems to be incorrect based on the expected values.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version uses the correct command to retrieve the fish version, stores the output in the `version` variable, and formats the return string according to the expected values.
