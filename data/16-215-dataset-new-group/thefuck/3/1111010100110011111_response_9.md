## The bug
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is not correctly extracting the version of the Fish shell. It's resulting in an assertion error because the returned value includes the text "fish, version" instead of just the version number.

## Potential error location
The issue seems to be with how the version string is being extracted from the output of the command. It appears that the entire line "fish, version 3.5.9" is being returned instead of just the version number.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is likely due to the extraction of the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The function is returning the entire output line instead of extracting just the version number.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly extract only the version number from the output of the command. This can be done using string manipulation, regular expressions, or by modifying the command to only return the version number.

## The corrected version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version of the `info` function properly extracts the version number from the command output by splitting the string at the comma and returning the second part. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output.
