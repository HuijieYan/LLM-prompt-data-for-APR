The bug in the function `info` is that it uses the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command used is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the correct command should be `fish --version`.

The `test_info` function in the test file sets up the `Popen` mock so that it returns the output of the `fish --version` command. However, the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is using the incorrect command to retrieve the version, leading to the mismatch in expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` function to use the correct command to get the version of Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
