The issue with the buggy function is that it is returning the version information along with the "Fish Shell" prefix, causing the assertion to fail. 

To fix this, we need to modify the return statement to remove the "fish, version" prefix and only return the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return version
```

With this corrected version, the function will only return the version number without the "Fish Shell" prefix, and the failing test case should pass.
