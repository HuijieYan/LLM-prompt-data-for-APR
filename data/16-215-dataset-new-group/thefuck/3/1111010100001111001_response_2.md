The bug in the provided code is that the `proc` object is not being fully consumed before trying to read from it. This can result in an empty or incomplete `version` value being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the process has completed before reading the output. We can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to do this.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version ensures that the process has completed before reading the output, preventing any issues with incomplete or empty values being returned.
