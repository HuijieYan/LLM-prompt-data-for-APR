The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is causing the failing test. The bug occurs because the function is extracting the version string from the command output incorrectly, which leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

The bug is caused by the following code:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
This code is extracting the version string from the output of the `fish` command, but it is not handling the prefix "fish, version" in the string properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the prefix "fish, version" correctly and extract only the version number from the output string. Once the version number is extracted, it should be formatted into the desired output format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(", version ")[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
In this corrected version, the `version_output` is split to extract only the version number, which is then used to format the output string correctly.

This should resolve the bug and make the `info` function produce the expected output.
