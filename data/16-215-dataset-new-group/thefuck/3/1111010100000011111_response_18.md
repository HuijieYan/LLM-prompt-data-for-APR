## The bug in the function

The bug occurs in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a subprocess to retrieve the version. However, there are multiple potential error locations:
1. The function is not handling any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.
2. The function is not using the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to read the output from the subprocess.
3. The function is not considering the possibility of an empty output from the subprocess.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation reads the output of the subprocess directly without waiting for the process to finish. Additionally, it does not handle any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution, leading to unexpected behavior and potential hanging.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug in the `info` function, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read the output from the subprocess and wait for the process to finish.
2. Handle any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution to prevent unexpected behavior and hanging.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            if version:
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
            else:
                return "Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version"
        except Exception as e:
            return "Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version: " + str(e)

```
