Based on the given information, it seems that the issue is with the way the version is being extracted from the output of the shell command. The expected output for the version includes the string "fish, version" while the buggy function is only extracting the version number.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to properly extract the version string that includes "fish, version".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly extract the version string "fish, version 3.5.9" and return "Fish Shell 3.5.9", which aligns with the expected output values. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
