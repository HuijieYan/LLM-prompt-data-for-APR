The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is not correctly retrieving the Fish shell's version, causing a failing test. This is evident from the failing test, which expects the function to return the string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but instead, it returns a string with the version number followed by the text 'fish' and a comma.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command in the `info` function is not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version. Instead of using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', the correct command should be 'fish --version'.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(",")[0].replace('fish', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the test should now pass, and the issue raised on GitHub related to the buggy function should also be resolved.
