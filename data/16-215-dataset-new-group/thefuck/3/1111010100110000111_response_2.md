Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it appears that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not returning the correct version of the Fish shell. It is also causing a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` returns the result with the string "fish, version" prefixed to the actual version number, which is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to remove the "fish, version" prefix from the version output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    
    # Remove the "fish, version" prefix from the version output
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. Additionally, it should resolve the recursive loop issue reported in the GitHub issue.
