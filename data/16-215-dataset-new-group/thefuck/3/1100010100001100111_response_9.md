The issue seems to be related to the plugin-thefuck triggering a recursive loop because of the 'info' function in the fish.py file. The function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell, but it seems to be causing a loop when used with the plugin. 

The potential error in the function is that it is trying to get the Fish version using Popen without waiting for the process to finish, which can cause issues with the recursion when used with the plugin.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to wait for the process to finish and then get the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and get the output. This should prevent the recursive loop issue when used with the plugin.
