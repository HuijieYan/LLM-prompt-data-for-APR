The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the name and version of the current shell using the `fish` command. It then reads the output from the command and formats it into a string to be returned. 

The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
1. Using `Popen` without waiting for the process to finish.
2. Reading from the process output without checking for errors.
3. Not handling potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the `Popen` command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not waiting for the process to finish before reading from its output, and it does not handle potential exceptions.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to wait for the process to finish before reading from its output, handle exceptions, and ensure that the process output is properly decoded and stripped before formatting it into a string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        if version:
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return "Fish Shell version not found"
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```
This corrected version of the function uses a try-except block to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the `Popen` command. It also waits for the process to finish before reading from its output, and it checks for and handles the case where the version may not be found.
