Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

The bug in the original function was caused by using the wrong command ('echo $FISH_VERSION') to retrieve the fish shell version. This caused the test to fail, as the expected version did not match the actual version returned by the function.

In the corrected version, I've changed the command to ['fish', '--version'] to correctly get the version of the fish shell. I've also modified the return statement to extract the version number from the output and format it as 'Fish Shell version_number'.

This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
