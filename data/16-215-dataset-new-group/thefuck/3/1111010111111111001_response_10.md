The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is being used to get the Fish shell version, but the expected output is not being received. The function then formats the received version in an incorrect way and returns it, leading to a failed test.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` function is not being used correctly to execute the command and capture the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly capture the Fish shell version and format it according to the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

With this corrected version, the function should now return the correct format for the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
