The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class appears to be in the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`, but the function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This mismatch causes the test to fail and produces the error message.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be updated to `fish --version`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected version, the test case provided should pass successfully.
