The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is passing `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but this is incorrect.

The correct command to get the Fish shell version is `fish --version`. 

To fix the bug, you should update the `Popen` command in the `info` function to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]  # Extracting the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
