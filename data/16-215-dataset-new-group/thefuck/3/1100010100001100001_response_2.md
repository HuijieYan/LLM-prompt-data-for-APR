The bug in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the output of the Popen process and retrieving the version information.

The potential error location is in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, where it is trying to directly read from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to finish or handling any potential errors.

The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` call is likely not returning the expected version information. This is evident from the type of `proc.stdout` being `MagicMock`, which indicates that it is a mock object used for testing, and not the actual output of the `Popen` process.

To fix the bug, we should wait for the `Popen` process to finish and handle any potential errors that may occur during the process. We can achieve this by using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, we use the `communicate` method to wait for the process to finish and retrieve the stdout and stderr streams. Then, we decode the stdout to get the version information. This should properly handle the output of the `Popen` process and fix the bug.
