The bug in the `info` function is that it is not returning the expected version of the Fish shell. It's expected to return the version with the string "fish, version" prefixed to it.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not capturing the correct output from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command and is not formatting it properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly capture the version and format it as per the expected value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version captures the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command using `proc.communicate()[0]` and then formats it as per the expected output. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
