Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of variables, it appears that the issue is with the output of the `info` function. The `version` variable is being extracted from the `proc` using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, but it is not being extracted correctly.

The bug is likely due to the incorrect extraction of the version from the stdout of the `proc`. It seems that the output includes the text "fish, version" which is not being handled properly, leading to the incorrect version being returned by the `info` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the extraction of the version from the `proc` output to handle the text "fish, version" correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version')[-1].strip() # Extract the version number after the comma
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This modification splits the output of the `proc` using the text "version" and selects the last part to get the correct version number.

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
