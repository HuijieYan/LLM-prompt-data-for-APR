## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `info` method is returning a version string that includes the command `fish, version` instead of just the version number. This is causing the assertion to fail.

### Identify potential error locations:
The error could be located in the command being run by Popen or in the way the output is being processed.

### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the command being run by Popen is returning more than just the version number, including the string `fish, version`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being run by Popen so that it only returns the version number and doesn't include the extra string `fish, version`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

This version of the function splits the version string by spaces and returns the last element, which should be the version number. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the test passes.
