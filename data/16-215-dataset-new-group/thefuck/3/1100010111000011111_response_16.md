## The buggy function
The buggy function `info` in `fish.py` is trying to get the version of the Fish Shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, the command being executed is not correct, leading to incorrect output.

## Potential error locations
1. The command being passed to `Popen` may be incorrect.
2. The way the output is being read and processed may be incorrect.

## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect command being executed to retrieve the Fish Shell version, as well as how the output is being handled. This results in incorrect version information being returned, causing the failing test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` should be changed to correctly retrieve the Fish Shell version. Additionally, the way the output is processed needs to be corrected to capture and return the correct version information.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The command passed to `Popen` has been changed to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the version information.
2. The output is processed to capture the version information correctly using `split()[-1]`.
3. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and return the correct Fish Shell version information.
