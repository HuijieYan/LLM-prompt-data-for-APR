The buggy function `info` in the file `fish.py` of the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is currently not extracting the correct version from the output of the subprocess.

The cause of the bug is that the subprocess Popen command is using the wrong argument to obtain the version of Fish shell. The correct argument to obtain the version is `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct argument to obtain the version of Fish shell before returning the version in the specified format.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function `info` in the `fish.py` file should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
