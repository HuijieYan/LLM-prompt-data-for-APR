The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. The issue is that the function is not correctly processing the output from the `Popen` subprocess call, resulting in an incorrect version being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly decoding and formatting the output from the subprocess call. The expected version of the Fish shell is '3.5.9', but the function is returning 'fish, version 3.5.9', which is incorrect. This is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly process the output from the subprocess call and return the expected version string.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].split()[1]  # Extracting the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly extract the version from the output of the subprocess call and return the expected 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' string.
