## Analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function "info" in the "Fish" class is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses the "thefuck -v" command, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way the version information is being retrieved. This causes the Fish shell initialization to hang, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the function is the use of the "thefuck -v" command triggering a recursive loop due to the way the version of the Fish shell is being retrieved.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub issue information

The bug is caused by the recursive loop triggered when the Oh-My-Fish plugin uses the "thefuck -v" command, which calls the "info" function to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This recursive loop causes the initialization of the Fish shell to hang, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved in the "info" function to prevent it from being called recursively when the "thefuck -v" command is used. This can be achieved by checking if the function is being called as a result of the "thefuck -v" command and bypassing the version retrieval in that case.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    @cache('.config/fish/config.fish')
    def _generate_alias_completion(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'complete -c thefuck -n "__fish_use_subcommand" -xa "(__fish_print_host_names)"'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.communicate()

    def info(self, is_thefuck_version=False):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if not is_thefuck_version:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return "Fish Shell"
```

In the corrected version, the "info" function takes an additional parameter `is_thefuck_version` which defaults to `False`. This parameter is used to check if the function is being called as a result of the "thefuck -v" command. If it is, the function returns a fixed string "Fish Shell" without actually retrieving the version of the Fish shell. This prevents the recursive loop and resolves the hanging issue during the initialization of the Fish shell.
