The potential error location within the buggy function is the usage of the '-c' argument in the Popen call, which might be causing the recursive loop.

The cause of the bug is that the '-c' argument in the Popen call triggers the recursive loop when the plugin-thefuck uses the thefuck -v command, causing the Fish shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin to hang.

To fix the bug, we can modify the info function to use a more direct method to obtain the Fish shell version without triggering the recursive loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the Popen call now uses the argument '--version' instead of '-c' and 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which should directly return the version of the Fish shell without causing the recursive loop.
