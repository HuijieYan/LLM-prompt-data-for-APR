The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the subprocess Popen object to retrieve the output. Instead of directly reading the stdout, it should use the communicate method to wait for the process to finish and then retrieve the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the communicate method, we ensure that the process has completed and then retrieve the output from stdout. This should fix the issue with the original buggy function.
