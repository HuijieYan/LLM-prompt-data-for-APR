The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is causing the failing test, which results in an AssertionError. The `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` is set to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` and the expected output of `shell.info()` is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The cause of the bug is that the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is being used to retrieve the version, but it is not providing the output in the expected format.

To fix the bug, we should modify the command to `fish --version` to get the version in the expected format. Additionally, we should update the call in the test to reflect this change.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `fish --version` in the command, we ensure that the version is retrieved in the correct format. This change should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
