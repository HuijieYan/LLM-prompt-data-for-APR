### Explanation
The issue seems to be caused by the fact that the `info` function is returning the entire output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, including the "fish, version" part. This causes the assertion error because the expected output is just the version number.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to only extract and return the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

### The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split()[2]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
