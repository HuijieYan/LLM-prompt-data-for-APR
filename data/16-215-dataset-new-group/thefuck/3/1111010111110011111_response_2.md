The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is reading the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is expecting a specific version number as the output of the function. The error message and the expected result indicate that the function is not returning the expected output.

The root cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the output "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just the version number "3.5.9". This causes the assertion to fail because the expected output does not match the actual output.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to extract only the version number from the output and then return the expected string "Fish Shell <version>".

Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info()` function will extract the version number from the command output and return the expected string "Fish Shell <version>".

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the test pass with the expected output.
