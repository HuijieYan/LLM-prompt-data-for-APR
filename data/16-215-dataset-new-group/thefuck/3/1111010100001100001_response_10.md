The bug in the function is that it is not properly waiting for the subprocess to finish before trying to read the output. This can result in an empty or incomplete output being read.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` class, which waits for the process to terminate and then returns a tuple containing the stdout and stderr output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will properly wait for the subprocess to finish and then read the output, ensuring that the correct version is returned.
