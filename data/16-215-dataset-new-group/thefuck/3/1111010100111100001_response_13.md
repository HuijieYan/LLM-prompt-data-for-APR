The bug in the provided function is that the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not being correctly parsed and formatted to obtain the version number of the Fish shell.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly decoding the output of the subprocess and is not correctly extracting the version number from the output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output of the subprocess is decoded correctly and the version number is extracted from it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_bytes = proc.stdout.read()
        version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
        return f"Fish Shell {version}"
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract and format the version number from the output of the subprocess. This should fix the failing test case.
