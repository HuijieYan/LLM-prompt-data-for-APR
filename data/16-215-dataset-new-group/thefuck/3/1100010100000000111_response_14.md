Potential error locations:
- The `Popen` function that is used to run the fish command and retrieve the version
- The `proc.stdout.read()` that reads the output of the command

Cause of the bug:
The bug is causing a recursive loop because the `info` function is calling `thefuck -v` which triggers the `Fish.info()` function to run again, creating a loop.

Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to avoid running `thefuck -v` within the `Fish.info` function, as this is what triggers the recursive loop.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    return u'Fish Shell'
```

This corrected version of the function avoids triggering the recursive loop by returning a static string for the shell name and removing the version retrieval process, which was causing the issue.
