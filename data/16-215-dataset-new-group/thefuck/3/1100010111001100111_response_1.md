## Fixing the bug
The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version, which leads to a recursive loop when using the `-v` option. The `Popen` command is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which does not match the expected command `['fish', '--version']` as pointed out in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command used with `Popen` should be updated to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
