## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By correcting the command used in the Popen function from 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to '--version', we can retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell. This change will ensure that the function returns the expected output and resolves the issue described in the GitHub context.
