## Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, universal_newlines=True) # Added universal_newlines=True to decode output
    version = proc.communicate()[0].strip()  # Used communicate() instead of proc.stdout.read() to prevent deadlock
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Removed unnecessary 'u' prefix
```

## Analysis
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it has a few potential errors:
1. The `decode` method is used directly on `proc.stdout.read()`, which could lead to a UnicodeDecodeError.
2. The function doesn't handle the output reading process properly, which might lead to a deadlock.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the decoding process and potential deadlock due to improperly reading the output from the subprocess.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is important to use `universal_newlines=True` while opening the subprocess to make sure the output is decoded properly. Additionally, using `communicate()` instead of directly reading from `proc.stdout` will prevent any potential deadlock.

After applying the bug fix strategy, the corrected version of the function is provided above.
