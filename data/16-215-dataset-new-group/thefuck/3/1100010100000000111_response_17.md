The potential error location within the buggy function is the use of `Popen` without waiting for the process to finish, which can lead to a recursive loop in certain cases.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function runs the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Fish shell, but in the context of Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, this triggers a recursive loop that hangs the initialization of the Fish shell.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the process to finish before reading the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and then reading the output, we can avoid the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
