## Bug Explanation
The current implementation of the `info` function in `fish.py` is reading the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and expecting it to be in the format `fish, version x.x.x`, but the actual output is in the format `x.x.x`. This mismatch in the format of the output is causing the assertion error in the test case.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to handle the version output correctly. It should read the version without the "fish, version" prefix and then format it according to the expected output format.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    actual_version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = actual_version.split(', version ')[-1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Formatting the output according to expected format
```
