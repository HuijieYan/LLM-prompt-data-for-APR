## The bug in the provided function

The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version of the Fish shell, but in the test case, it is expecting the command `fish --version`. This discrepancy in the expected and actual command leads to the failing test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be updated to use the command `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell. This will align with the expectations of the test case and resolve the failing test.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will execute the correct command to obtain the version of the Fish shell, resolving the failing test and fixing the bug.
