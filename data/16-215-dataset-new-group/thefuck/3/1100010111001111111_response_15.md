## The bug analysis
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version of Fish Shell. However, the test function is expecting the command `fish --version` instead. This inconsistency causes the test to fail.

The GitHub issue further indicates that using `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop because of the wrong command being used in the `info` function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command `fish --version` to retrieve the version of Fish Shell. This will align the function with the expectations of the test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
