The bug in the given function is that it is not properly reading the version of the Fish shell. The test case is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output of the function. The error message shows that the actual output includes additional unnecessary text.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the version of the Fish shell along with the string "fish, version". This additional text is causing the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command to only return the version number without any additional text.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Remove unwanted text
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the unnecessary text "fish, version" is removed from the version string before returning it. This will ensure that only the version number is returned, which should make the function pass the failing test.
