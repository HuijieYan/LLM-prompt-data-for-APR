### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' and capturing the output. However, in the failing test, the expected version is '3.5.9' but the actual version returned by the function is 'fish, version 3.5.9', causing a failed assertion.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error is likely in the method of capturing the version string from the output of the process.

### Explanation of the Bug
The function is not capturing the correct version string from the output of the command, resulting in the extra 'fish, version' prefix being included in the returned version.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The method for capturing the version needs to be fixed by ensuring that unnecessary strings such as 'fish, version' are properly removed from the version string returned by the command.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the command used to get the version is changed to 'fish --version' and the unnecessary 'fish, version' prefix is removed from the returned version string.
