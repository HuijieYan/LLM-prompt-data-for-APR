## Fix for the buggy function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function was trying to retrieve the Fish Shell version by using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which was causing a recursive loop due to a plugin in Oh-My-Fish. The fix involves using the command '--version' instead of the environment variable, and modifying the output parsing to correctly extract the version number.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should resolve the recursive loop problem.

The fixed function should now pass the failing test and prevent the recursive loop issue.
