The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` command is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version, but the test is expecting the version to be obtained using `['fish', '--version']`. 

To fix this bug, the command used in the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
