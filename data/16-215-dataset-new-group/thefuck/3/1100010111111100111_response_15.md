# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the provided buggy function, the issue seems to be with the command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The test is failing because the actual version obtained from the command doesn't match the expected version.

The call to Popen should use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. After making this change, the output of `proc.stdout.read()` needs to be split to extract only the version number.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and should now return the correct version of the Fish shell.

```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
