## Correction

### Error location:
The error lies in the `info` function in the `fish.py` file. The function is not fetching the correct version from the output of the Popen command.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused because the Popen command is not using the correct arguments to fetch the Fish shell version, leading to an incorrect version being returned by the `info` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `Popen` command should be modified to use the correct arguments to fetch the Fish shell version and ensure the correct version is returned by the `info` function.

### Corrected code

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `Popen` command now uses the correct arguments to fetch the Fish shell version, and the `info` function processes the output to extract the correct version. This should resolve the issue and ensure the correct version is returned.
