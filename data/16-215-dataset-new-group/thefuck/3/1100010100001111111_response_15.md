The buggy function is `info` in the file `fish.py` from the `thefuck` project.

The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, the Fish shell. It does so by executing a command to fetch the version and then formatting it to include the name of the shell.

The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the usage of the `thefuck -v` command is causing a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.

Looking at the runtime and expected values, it seems that the incorrect version format is being returned. The expected version should include "fish, version" before the actual version number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the formatting of the version string to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly return the name and version of the Fish shell. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and align with the expected output values.
