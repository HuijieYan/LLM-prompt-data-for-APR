The issue with the buggy function is that it is using `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output of the `Popen` command, but it is not waiting for the process to complete before attempting to read the output. This can result in an empty or incomplete output being read.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to complete and then returns a tuple of stdout and stderr output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
