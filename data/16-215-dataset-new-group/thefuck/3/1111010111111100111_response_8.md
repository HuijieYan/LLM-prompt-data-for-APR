#### The cause of the bug:
The buggy function `info` attempts to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, it should be running `fish --version` to get the version. This is evident in the failing test `test_info` where the correct version string is `fish, version 3.5.9`, but the function is returning a different version string `'3.5.9'`.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` function to run the correct command `fish --version` and parse the output to extract the version number.

#### The corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_info.split(',')[1].strip().split()[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
