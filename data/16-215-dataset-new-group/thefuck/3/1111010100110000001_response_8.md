## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` from a subprocess. However, the issue arises from the incorrect handling of the command's output. Additionally, there is a mismatch of the expected output string due to the way the command's result is formatted.

## Bug Location
The potential error is located within the `info` function where the command's output is not properly processed and the formatting of the version string is incorrect. This results in a mismatch of the expected and actual output.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the command output is not handled properly. The decoded string from process stdout includes the additional text "fish, version" which is not expected in the output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the code to extract the version number from the command's output while removing the unnecessary text. Also, the formatting of the version string should be corrected to match the expected output.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_text = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    # Extract the version number from the text
    version = version_text.replace('fish, version', '').strip()

    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
