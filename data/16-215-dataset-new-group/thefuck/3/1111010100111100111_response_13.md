The issue is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is returning the version value along with the string "Fish Shell". This is causing the assertion error in the unit test because the expected value is "Fish Shell 3.5.9" but the actual return value is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly format the version value with the string "Fish Shell".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

With this modification, the function will only return the version number without the extra text "fish, version", and it will match the expected value "Fish Shell 3.5.9" in the failing test.
