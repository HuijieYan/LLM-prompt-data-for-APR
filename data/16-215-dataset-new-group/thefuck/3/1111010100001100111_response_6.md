## Updated and corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function `info` is caused by directly calling `proc.stdout.read()` to get the output of the command. This can lead to hanging or not getting the output as expected, causing the mentioned issue with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

The corrected version uses `proc.communicate()` to properly retrieve the output from the subprocess and decode it to a string. This method ensures that the process is properly closed and that all output is captured.

The corrected version should resolve the recursive loop issue when using the TheFuck plugin with Fish shell and Oh-My-Fish.
