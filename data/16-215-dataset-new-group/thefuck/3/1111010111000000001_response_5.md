The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. The main issue in the function is that it is calling `Popen` with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` but the test is expecting the command `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the handling of the stdout data from the process is incorrect, leading to incorrect version retrieval and comparison.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command needs to be updated to `['fish', '--version']` and the way to extract the version from stdout data should be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
