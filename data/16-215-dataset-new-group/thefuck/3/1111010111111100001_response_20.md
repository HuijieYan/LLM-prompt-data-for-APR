The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the incorrect command to get the fish shell version, and it is not handling the output format correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the test case is expecting the command '--version' to be used. Additionally, the format of the shell version output is not being handled correctly, causing the mismatch in the assert statement.

To fix the bug, we need to use the correct command to get the shell version and then properly format the output to match the expected value in the test case.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fixed version, the function should return the shell version in the expected format, and the failing test should pass.
