The cause of the bug in the `info` function is that it is not properly extracting the version number from the output of the `fish --version` command. It is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which does not return the correct version number format.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to get the version number from the shell. We should use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to correctly extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly extract the version number and pass the failing test.
