The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not waiting for the `Popen` process to finish before trying to read from its stdout. This could cause the function to return incorrect output or raise errors.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` class to wait for the process to finish and to read from its stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
