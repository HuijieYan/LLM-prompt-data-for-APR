To fix the bug in the `info` function, we need to ensure that the version string returned includes the text "fish, version" before the actual version number. Additionally, we need to properly handle the Popen object and its stdout attribute to retrieve the correct version value.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish ', 'fish, version ')
    return u'{}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `--version` flag to directly retrieve the version information from the fish shell. Then, we manipulate the version string to include the text "fish, version" before the actual version number. Finally, we return the modified version string.

With this corrected version, the `info` function should now return the expected version string "fish, version 3.5.9" when the input parameters match the expected values and types specified in the test case.
