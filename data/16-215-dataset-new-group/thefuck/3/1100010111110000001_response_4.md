The issue with the `info` function is that it is not using the correct command to get the fish version. The `Popen` command is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` whereas the test function is expecting the command `fish --version`. This causes the failing test, which results in an assertion error as the expected and actual output strings are different.

To fix this issue, we need to update the command in the `Popen` call in the `info` function to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the fish version using the `fish --version` command, and the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
