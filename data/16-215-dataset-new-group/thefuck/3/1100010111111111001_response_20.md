The buggy function is the 'info' method in the 'fish.py' file. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the subprocess Popen to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the shell version.

However, in the failing test, the error message shows that the function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This indicates that the Popen command is not fetching the correct version output.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command is executing the wrong command. It should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

To fix the bug, we should modify the Popen command to execute 'fish --version' to get the correct shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
