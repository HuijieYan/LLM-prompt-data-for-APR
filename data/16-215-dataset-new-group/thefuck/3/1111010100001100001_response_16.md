## Strategy for fixing the bug
The issue appears to be with how the output of the Popen process is being handled. It seems that the Popen object is being mocked, which may be leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the Popen process is properly executed and the output is captured accurately.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
