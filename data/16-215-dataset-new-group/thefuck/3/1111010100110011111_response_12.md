## Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the `Popen` function to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that the returned version includes more data than just the version number, leading to the assertion failure.

## Potential error locations
1. The `Popen` command might be returning additional information along with the version number.
2. The decoding of the output from `Popen` might not be handling the data correctly.
3. The format string used to return the version might be incorrect.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `Popen` command returning additional information along with the version number, leading to the incorrect assertion failure.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly extract only the version number from the output of the `Popen` command and return it in the correct format.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
