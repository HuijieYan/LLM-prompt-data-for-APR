## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function is using Popen without handling the return code or waiting for the process to finish, which could cause it to hang.
2. The function is fetching the version of Fish shell using 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which may not work in all environments.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the GitHub Issue information:
The buggy function `info` attempts to fetch the version of the Fish shell using an environment variable `$FISH_VERSION` and the `echo` command. This approach may lead to a recursive loop, triggering hangs, especially when invoked by the Oh-My-Fish plugin, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the method to use a more reliable and standard way to fetch the version of the Fish shell.
2. Add error handling to the Popen call and ensure that the process is correctly closed.

## Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode == 0:
            version = stderr.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return "Fish shell version retrieval failed"
    except Exception as e:
        return "An error occurred while retrieving the Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```
