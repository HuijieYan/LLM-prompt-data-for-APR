## Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The buggy function is a method named `info` within the `Fish` class. It is used to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` subprocess to execute a command and capture the output, then formats the output to include the version information.

The GitHub issue states that the `-v` option in the `thefuck` plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` method. This suggests that the `info` function is not handling the command execution and output retrieval correctly, causing unexpected behavior with the `thefuck` plugin in Fish Shell.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations include:
1. Incorrect usage of the `Popen` subprocess.
2. Improper handling of the command output.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the provided information

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not properly executing the command to retrieve the Fish Shell version. This leads to unexpected behavior when the `thefuck` plugin uses the `-v` option, causing a recursive loop.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Popen` subprocess is executed correctly to retrieve the Fish Shell version, and the command output is captured and handled properly to avoid any unexpected behavior.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function:
1. The `Popen` subprocess is now set to `shell=True` to correctly execute the shell command.
2. The `communicate()` method is used to capture the output of the command.
3. The output is then decoded and stripped to obtain the version information.

This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `info` function retrieves the Fish Shell version correctly.
