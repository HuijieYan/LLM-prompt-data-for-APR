## Correction

The buggy function has a few issues that need to be addressed in order to fix the bug. The function `info` is currently fetching the Fish Shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the failing test indicates that the version it receives is in the format `fish, version 3.5.9` which does not match the expected output format. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to fetch the version, and then format the output accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, I've changed the command from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version` to fetch the version directly. Then I extracted the version number from the output and used it to format the return value.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue reported in GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the plugin.
