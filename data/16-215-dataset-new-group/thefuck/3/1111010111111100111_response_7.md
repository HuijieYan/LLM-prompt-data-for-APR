To fix the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class, we need to update the command used to get the Fish shell version and also correct the comparison in the failing test. Additionally, the function should return the correct formatted version of the Fish shell.

### Steps to fix the bug:
1. Update the command to retrieve the Fish shell version to `'fish --version'` instead of `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.
2. Modify the failing test to assert the correct value of `Popen.call_args[0][0]`.
3. Return the correctly formatted Fish shell version from the `info` function.

### Corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Updated failing test:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue in GitHub.
