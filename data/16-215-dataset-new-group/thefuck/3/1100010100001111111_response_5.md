## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the fact that the `info` function is not returning the expected output, causing a recursive loop and hanging the initialization of the Fish shell when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This is due to the incorrect way of retrieving the version of the Fish shell.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly capture the version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop and ensure that the function returns the expected output.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
