The bug in the given code is that the Popen command is using the incorrect command to get the Fish version.

#### Analysis:
The `info` function is using the `Popen` command to execute `echo $FISH_VERSION` and retrieve the Fish version. However, this command is incorrect and will not provide the desired result. The failing test is asserting the output to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, which indicates that the output should include the phrase "Fish Shell" followed by the version number.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the function to return a different output from the expected one. This is because the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not providing the correct version format, resulting in an output that does not match the expected value.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the Popen command should be updated to use `fish --version` to retrieve the Fish version in the expected format.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this correction, the `info` function will use the correct command to retrieve the Fish version, and the output will match the expected value, thereby passing the failing test.
