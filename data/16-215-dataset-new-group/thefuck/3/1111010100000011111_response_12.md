## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the function is not handling the `Popen` subprocess properly, leading to a potential hang during shell initialization when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.

## Identified potential error locations
1. Improper handling of the `Popen` subprocess object and its output.
2. Potential infinite loop due to the interaction with the `thefuck` plugin.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the improper handling of the `Popen` subprocess object and its output. Specifically, the function doesn't properly handle the subprocess output, which can lead to a hang during shell initialization when used with the `thefuck` plugin.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess is properly handled and its output is read and decoded correctly. Additionally, we need to consider the interaction with the `thefuck` plugin and avoid potential recursive loops during shell initialization.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        proc.terminate()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to read the output of the subprocess. Additionally, we make sure to terminate the subprocess after reading its output to prevent potential hangs. This should resolve the issue with the `thefuck` plugin in Oh-My-Fish.
