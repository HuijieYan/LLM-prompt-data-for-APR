The bug in the provided function `info` is caused by the incorrect command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` command is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version, whereas the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the command used in `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This will ensure that the correct version is retrieved and compared in the test function.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and the failing test for the `info` function will pass. This fix also addresses the reported issue on GitHub related to the recursive loop in the `thefuck -v` command triggering the Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The fix should resolve the issue and prevent the recursive loop.
