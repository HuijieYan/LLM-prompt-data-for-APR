## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The Popen command might not be properly capturing the output from the fish shell command.
2. The decoding of the output from proc.stdout might not be handled correctly.
3. There could be a potential issue with the version of the Fish shell causing a recursive loop.


## Explanation of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information:
The bug seems to be related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command used by the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This command calls the `info` function in the `Fish` class, which in turn triggers a recursive loop due to the way the version information is obtained from the Fish shell.


## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function in the `Fish` class to properly capture the version information from the Fish shell without triggering a recursive loop. This may involve changing the way the version information is retrieved and handling it in a way that avoids the recursive call when using the `thefuck -v` command.


## The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        if version.startswith('Fish'):
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return 'Unknown version'
```
