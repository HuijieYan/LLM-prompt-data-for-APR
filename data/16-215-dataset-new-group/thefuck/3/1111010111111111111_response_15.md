The issue with the current implementation of the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is attempting to fetch the Fish shell version using an incorrect command. The `info` function is currently using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to fetch the Fish shell version, but it should be using `fish --version`. Additionally, the return format `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` is not appropriate, it should be 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version).

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version', '').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected function will use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and format the output appropriately. This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
