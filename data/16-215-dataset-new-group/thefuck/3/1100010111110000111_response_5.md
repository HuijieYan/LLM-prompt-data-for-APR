The potential error in the buggy function lies in the command used in Popen to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The command passed to Popen is ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], but in the test, Popen.call_args[0][0] is compared with ['fish', '--version']. This indicates that the command being executed is incorrect, leading to a mismatch in the expected version and the actual version retrieved from the command.

The cause of the bug is that the command passed to Popen to retrieve the version of Fish shell is different from what is being compared in the test. This causes the test to fail due to a mismatch in the expected and actual versions.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be updated to reflect the correct way to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, the test comparison should be updated to match the command being used to retrieve the version in the Popen call.

Given the buggy function and the identified issue, here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```
