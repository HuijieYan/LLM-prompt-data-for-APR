The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the fish shell, but it's not doing it correctly. The test is failing because the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

It seems that the command being executed in the subprocess is incorrect, causing the function to return the wrong version of the shell.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command being executed in the subprocess to retrieve the correct version of the fish shell. The correct command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version[len('fish, version '):])
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the fish shell, which will pass the failing test.
