The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to get the Fish version, and the expected value is not being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command passed to Popen to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. We also need to update the decoding to strip the "fish, version " text from the version output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()[13:]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
