## Buggy Function Analysis

The buggy function is part of the `Fish` class and it is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell) when invoked. The function uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command in the Fish shell and capture its output.

## Potential Error Locations

1. Incorrect command execution using `Popen`.
2. Improper handling of the output from the subprocess.

## Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the improper handling of subprocess output. The function uses `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output from the subprocess, which may result in a blocking call and an incomplete or empty output.

## Suggested Bug-Fixing Strategy

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the subprocess output by waiting for the process to finish and then reading the output. This can be achieved using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object.

## Corrected Version

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `communicate()` method is used to wait for the process to finish and retrieve the output. The output is then decoded to a string and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace before being returned as the shell name and version.
