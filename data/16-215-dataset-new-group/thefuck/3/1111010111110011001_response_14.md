The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it's using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. It's currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is not the correct command to get the version information.

To fix this bug, the `info` function should be modified to retrieve the version information using the correct command and then format it properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will now retrieve the correct version information using the `--version` command and format it properly.

This should address the bug and the failing test, and the new version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values.
