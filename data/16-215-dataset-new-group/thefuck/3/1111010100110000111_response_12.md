The bug in the `Fish.info` function is caused by `Popen.return_value.stdout.read()` returning `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which includes the string "fish, version" as part of the version output. The `info` function then appends `u'Fish Shell '` to the beginning of the version string, resulting in the assertion failure in the test.

To fix this bug, the `info` function should be modified to remove the extra "fish, version" part from the version string before appending "Fish Shell" to it.

Here's the corrected version of the `Fish.info` function with the bug fixed:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Remove 'fish, version' from the version string
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

With this fix, the `info` function will properly extract the version number and remove any unnecessary text before returning the correct version string.
