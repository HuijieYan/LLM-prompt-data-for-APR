The issue with the current `info` function in the `fish.py` file is that it is using the wrong command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) to fetch the version of the Fish shell and not handling the output correctly. This is causing issues with the test case `test_info` as it expects the correct version of the Fish shell to be returned.

Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test case, the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version is `fish --version`, and the returned output should be parsed to extract the version number.

To fix the bug, the `info` function in the `fish.py` file should be updated to use the correct command to fetch the version and properly parse the output to extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the `info` function, it should now pass the failing test case and return the correct version of the Fish shell as expected.
