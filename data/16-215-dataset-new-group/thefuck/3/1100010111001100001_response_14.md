The bug in the provided function lies in the command used to fetch the fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' does not actually return the version of the fish shell. Additionally, the test is expecting the command 'fish --version' to be used.

To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the fish shell version should be updated to 'fish --version'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass.
