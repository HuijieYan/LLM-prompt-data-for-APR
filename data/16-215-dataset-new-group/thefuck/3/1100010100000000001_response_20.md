## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, encoding='utf-8')
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.strip()
    return f"Fish Shell {version}"
```

## Explanation
The buggy function has a potential error in reading the output from the subprocess. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` can cause issues if the subprocess output is too large or if there are any encoding errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it's better to use the `proc.communicate()` method to read the output of the subprocess. Also, passing the `encoding` parameter with value `'utf-8'` ensures that the output is decoded correctly.

By using the `proc.communicate()` method, we can avoid potential issues related to reading large or complex output from the subprocess.

The corrected version of the function provides the necessary bug fix by using `proc.communicate()` and including the `encoding='utf-8'` parameter.
