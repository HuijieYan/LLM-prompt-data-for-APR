## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The potential error locations within the original buggy function were:

1. The command being passed to Popen was incorrect, as it should have been `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
2. The usage of `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect` in the failing test was incorrect and not aligned with the command used in the original buggy function.
3. The call_args verification in the failing test was also incorrect and not aligned with the correct command.

The fix involves updating the command for Popen to use `['fish', '--version']` and updating the failing test to reflect the corrected command.

The corrected version of the buggy function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.

With the corrected version of the buggy function as shown above, it will now properly return the name and version of the current shell and resolve the issue related to the use of the `thefuck` plugin with Fish Shell.
