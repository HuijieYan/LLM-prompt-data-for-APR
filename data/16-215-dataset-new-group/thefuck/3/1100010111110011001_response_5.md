The problem with the `info` function is that it is trying to extract the Fish version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the version is actually obtained by running `fish --version`, which is a different command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command used to get the Fish version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass the failing test and return the expected values.
