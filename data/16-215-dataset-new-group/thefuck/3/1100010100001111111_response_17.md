Based on the runtime and expected values, it appears that the issue is with the `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package. The function tries to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess and then formats it as the name and version of the shell.

The bug seems to be related to how the version information is retrieved, leading to the hanging of the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The function should return the correct name and version of the shell without causing any recursive loop.

The fix for the bug would involve modifying the way the version information is retrieved from the Fish shell and ensuring that it does not cause a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `--version` flag to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and then formatting it as the name and version of the shell. This should resolve the hanging issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin and correctly return the name and version of the Fish shell.
