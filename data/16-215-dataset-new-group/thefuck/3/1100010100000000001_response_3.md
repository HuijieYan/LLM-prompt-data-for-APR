The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. The use of `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` - this syntax is not compatible with Python 3.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to use the old style Unicode string syntax (u'...') which is not compatible with Python 3.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove the `u` prefix before the string and use the f-string format for better readability.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
