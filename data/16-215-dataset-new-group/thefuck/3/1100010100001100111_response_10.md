### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location in the buggy function is the Popen call that executes the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell. The issue on GitHub also suggests that this function is causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug is caused by the Popen call not capturing the standard output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command correctly. This causes the function to hang and triggers a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the standard output of the Popen call is properly captured and read.

### The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is replaced with `proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()`, which correctly captures the standard output of the command and resolves the hanging issue.
