The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by using an incorrect command in the Popen call. The command being used currently is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the correct command should be `fish --version`. This results in the function returning an incorrect value. To fix the bug, we need to update this command in the `Popen` call.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version, and the failing test should pass without any issues.
