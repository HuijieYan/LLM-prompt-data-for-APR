## Correction
The issue with the buggy function is that it is not waiting for the `Popen` process to finish before attempting to read from its output. This can lead to the function returning incorrect or unexpected values.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to finish and then read its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction ensures that the function waits for the `Popen` process to finish before attempting to read from its output, thereby returning the expected version of the Fish shell.
