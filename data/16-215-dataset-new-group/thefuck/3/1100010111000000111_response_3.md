## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

The cause of the bug:
- The original function reads the output of the shell command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the Fish version, but the test expects the version to be retrieved using the '--version' flag.
- This discrepancy causes the test to fail and leads to the issue reported on GitHub.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the function to use the correct command ('fish --version') and format the output to match the expectations of the test.

The corrected version of the function:
- The function has been modified to use Popen(['fish', '--version']) to retrieve the version, and it formats the output to match the expected result of the test.
