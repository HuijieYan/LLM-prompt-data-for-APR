## The bug

The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the version string retrieved from the `fish` shell. The function expects the version string to be in the format "fish, version X.X.X", but it actually receives "X.X.X" without the "fish, version" prefix. This causes the assertion error when comparing the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9" with the actual output "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to extract the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and format it as "Fish Shell X.X.X" before returning.

## The corrected version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```
