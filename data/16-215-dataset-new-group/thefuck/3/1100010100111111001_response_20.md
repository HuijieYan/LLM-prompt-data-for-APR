The issue with the code lies in how the version of the Fish shell is being retrieved. The code is currently expecting the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to be just the version number, but it is getting the string "fish, version 3.5.9" instead.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to extract just the version number from the returned string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This version of the function uses the `fish -v` command to retrieve the Fish shell version, and then strips away the unnecessary part of the returned string to obtain just the version number. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected value.
