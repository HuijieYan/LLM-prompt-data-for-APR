The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is causing the failing test due to an incorrect command to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The expected version value is not being obtained in the correct manner, leading to a mismatch with the test assertion.

The cause of the bug is that the command being used to retrieve the Fish Shell version is incorrect, and this is leading to the wrong version information being returned. The failing test is comparing the expected version with the actual version obtained using the incorrect command, resulting in an assertion error.

To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version should be used. Additionally, the decoding and stripping operations on the obtained version should be handled properly to ensure the expected version is returned.

Given the analysis, the corrected version of the `info` function is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version modifies the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version to `['fish', '--version']`, which is the correct command. It also ensures that the version obtained from the process output is decoded properly and stripped of whitespace, providing the expected version value.
