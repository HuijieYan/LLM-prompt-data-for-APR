The issue with the buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is that it uses the `Popen` object to call the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and then tries to read the output directly from `proc.stdout`. 
This is causing the test to fail as it does not return the expected version value in the desired format.

The potential error location is the line:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
This is where the function tries to read the output directly from `proc.stdout`, which could be causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` object's `stdout.read` method is configured incorrectly, and it does not return the expected version value.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to read the correct version output format and handle the command execution.

Below is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
By modifying the command to `fish --version` and handling the output correctly, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell.

This should fix the failing test that expects the version to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
