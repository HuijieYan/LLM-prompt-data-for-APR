The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is returning the entire output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, which includes the "fish, version" text. This is causing the assertion to fail because the expected output is just "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract only the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(", version")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the `info` function should now return the correct version number extracted from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
