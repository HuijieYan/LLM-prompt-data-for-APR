The potential error location within the buggy function is the `version` variable, which seems to include the word "fish, version" in the output.

The cause of the bug is that the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` includes the string "fish, version". This string is not expected and causes the mismatch in the comparison.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the processing of the output from the `Popen` command to remove the unwanted part of the string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version processes the output from the `Popen` command to remove the unwanted "fish, version" part of the string. This should resolve the comparison mismatch and fix the bug.
