## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell. However, the Popen call with stdout=PIPE and stderr=DEVNULL doesn't handle the process output correctly, resulting in the process hanging and causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The Popen call may not be handling the process output correctly.
2. The stdout.read() may not be capturing the output as expected.
3. The decoding of the output may be causing issues.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the Popen call not handling the process output correctly, leading to the process hanging and causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Popen call correctly captures the output of the command and that the output is then decoded as expected. Additionally, we need to handle any potential errors or hanging processes to prevent the recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to capture the output and any potential errors. Then, we decode the output as expected and return the shell name and version. This should prevent the hanging and recursive loop issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
