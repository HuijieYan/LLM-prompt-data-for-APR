The buggy function is the `info` function within the `Fish` class in the file `thefuck/shells/fish.py`. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it incorrectly gathers the version of the Fish shell, resulting in a failing test.

### Error Identification
The error is likely due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to retrieve the full version string of the Fish shell instead of just the version number, leading to a mismatch when compared to the expected value in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the command to retrieve the Fish shell version needs to be modified to only capture the version number and exclude additional text in the output.

### Corrected Function
Here's the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the command to retrieve the Fish shell version has been updated to capture the version number only. This should resolve the bug and ensure the function returns the expected version of the Fish shell.

This correction should satisfy the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command in Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.
