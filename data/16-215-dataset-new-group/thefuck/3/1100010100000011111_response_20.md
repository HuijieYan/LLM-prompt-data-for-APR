The bug in the provided function `info` is likely caused by the use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` without waiting for the process to complete. This can lead to a race condition where the function tries to read from the process before it has completed, resulting in an empty string being returned as the version.

To fix the bug, we can use the `proc.communicate()` method to wait for the process to complete and then retrieve the output. Additionally, we can handle any potential errors that may occur during the process execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to complete and retrieve the output
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error retrieving shell information: {}".format(str(e))
```

With these changes, the function will properly wait for the process to complete and handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function returns the expected version information for the Fish Shell.
