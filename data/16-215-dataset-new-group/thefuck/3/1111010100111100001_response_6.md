The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The returned version is not stripped of the extra text, resulting in the wrong comparison during the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly parse the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to retrieve only the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
