The bug in the `info` function is that it is not correctly capturing the version value from the output of the shell command.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the shell command to extract the version information. At the moment, it is directly using the output without any parsing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly parse the version information from the output of the shell command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version part from the output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version of the function should correctly parse the version information from the output of the shell command and return the expected result.

Now, when the failing test is executed, it should pass without any assertion errors.
