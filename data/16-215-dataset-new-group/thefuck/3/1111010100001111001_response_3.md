The bug in the provided function is that the 'info' function is not returning the expected version string from the Fish shell. The version string is being extracted from the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, but it is not being formatted correctly in the return statement.

The cause of the bug is that the return statement is using the wrong format to build the version string.

To fix the bug, the return statement should use the correct format to build the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```
