The issue with the buggy function is that it is using a MagicMock object instead of an actual Popen object to execute the command and retrieve the shell version. This is likely causing the function to return incorrect values.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the Popen object is correctly instantiated and the stdout is read to retrieve the shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `communicate` method of the Popen object to retrieve the output of the command. This will ensure that we get the correct shell version and return it as the output of the function.
