Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be the incorrect output format of the `info` function in the `fish.py` file. The `info` function is expected to return "Fish Shell 3.5.9" but it is returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not properly parsing the version string from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `info` function to parse the version string correctly from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This version of the function will correctly parse the version string from the output of the command and return the expected format "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This should resolve the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
