## Analysis
1. The buggy function is a method named `info` within the `Fish` class. It is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output.
2. The potential error locations are in the handling of the Popen process and reading the output from the process.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not wait for the Popen process to complete, and directly reads from its output, which can cause the function to hang in certain cases, leading to a recursive loop. This behavior is in line with the GitHub issue that mentions the plugin causing the shell initialization to hang due to the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Popen process completes before reading its output, and handle any potential issues with the process to prevent hanging and recursive loops.

## Bug Fix 
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()  # Wait for the process to complete and get the output
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, we use the `communicate` method of the process to wait for it to complete and return the output. This ensures that the function does not hang and the process is handled properly.
