Buggy Function Analysis:
The function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell in this case). The function attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing a command using `Popen`, capturing the output, and formatting it into a string.

Potential Error Locations:
1. The `Popen` call may not execute successfully due to incorrect parameters or environment setup.
2. Reading the process output using `proc.stdout.read()` may cause a delay in reading the output.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current function is that the output of the command executed by `Popen` is not being read correctly. This can cause the function to return an incorrect or empty value.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the `Popen` call executes successfully and that the output is correctly captured and read.

Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle exception, e.g., log the error
        return "Error retrieving Fish shell version"
```

In the corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to retrieve the output of the command and handle any exceptions that may occur during the process execution. This ensures that the function returns the correct shell version or handles errors gracefully.
