The buggy function `info` is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, the test fails due to an unexpected format discrepancy in the version string returned by the `fish` command. This happens because the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` returns "fish, version 3.5.9" which differs from the expected format "3.5.9". Thus, the return value of the `info` function also contains an unexpected format.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `info` function to extract only the version part from the output of the `fish` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the `info` function should now return the expected version string, and the test should pass successfully.
