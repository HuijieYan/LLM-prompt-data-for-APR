The buggy function has an issue with the command it is using to retrieve the Fish Shell version and the way it processes the result. The Popen command is using 'fish -c' with 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version. However, the test case is expecting a different version format, 'fish, version 3.5.9\n', which causes the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command does not output the version in the format expected by the test case. This results in a mismatch between the actual and expected values.

To fix the bug, the Popen command should be modified to use 'fish --version' to retrieve the version in the expected format. Additionally, the processing of the version string needs to be adjusted to extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function will retrieve the Fish Shell version using the correct command and process the output to extract the version number. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It will also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
