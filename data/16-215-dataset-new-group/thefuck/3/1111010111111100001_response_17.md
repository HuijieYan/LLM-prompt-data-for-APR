The buggy function `info` in the class `Fish` is attempting to extract the version of the fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output. However, the test is failing because the function is not extracting the correct version format.

The potential error in the function is with this line:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
It seems that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the string "fish, version 3.5.9" and the function is not correctly parsing this output to extract the version.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the command `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This will ensure that the correct version format is captured.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read()
    version = version_output.split(b' ')[2].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
