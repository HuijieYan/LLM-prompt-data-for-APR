The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is not correctly fetching the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` call is using the wrong command to get the version, and it is not handling the output correctly. This leads to incorrect version retrieval and causes the failing test `test_info` to fail.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect command used in the `Popen` call and the mishandling of the output variable `version`. The command used in the `Popen` call is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which is not the command to fetch the version. The correct command to get the version is `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the `version` variable is incorrectly assigned the output of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be modified to use the correct command to fetch the version, and the `version` variable should be correctly assigned the output of the command.

Based on the explanation, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will return the correct version of the Fish shell and satisfy the expected input/output values.
