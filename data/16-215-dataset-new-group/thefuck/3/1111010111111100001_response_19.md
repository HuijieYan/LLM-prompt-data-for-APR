The bug in the provided function lies in the inconsistency between the command being executed and the command that is expected to be executed.

The function 'info' is expected to return the version of the fish shell. However, the command being executed is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which does not match the expected command of 'fish --version'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed to 'fish --version' in order to correctly retrieve the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the test case should pass as the function will now correctly execute the 'fish --version' command to retrieve the version of the fish shell.
