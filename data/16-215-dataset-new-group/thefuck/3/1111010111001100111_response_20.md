### Bug Fix Strategy
The issue seems to be related to the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and is causing a recursive loop. To fix this bug, we need to update the command being used to retrieve the version and ensure that it does not cause a recursive loop.

### Updated Buggy Function 
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the updated function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The updated `info` function within the `Fish` class now uses the command `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the Fish shell version, preventing the recursive loop issue.
