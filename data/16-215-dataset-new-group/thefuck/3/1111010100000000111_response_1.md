## Potential Error Locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is where the proc object is created using the Popen function, as this is where the recursive loop is triggered when the plugin uses the `thefuck -v` command.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that when the `thefuck -v` command is used, it triggers a recursive loop in the `Fish.info()` function. This is due to the way the `Popen` function is used to execute the command using the Fish shell.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `thefuck -v` command is executed in the `Fish.info()` function to avoid the recursive loop. This may involve changing the command or altering the way it is executed to prevent the recursive behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['echo $FISH_VERSION'], shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `Popen` function is modified to use the `shell=True` argument and execute the command directly using the echo command, which should prevent the recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used.
