The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it's trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the command to get the version of Fish shell should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, leading to the incorrect version being returned.

To fix this issue, the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this update, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell when called, and the failing test should pass.
