First, let's identify the potential error in the given function. The function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, using the `fish` command with the `-c` option to execute the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, the bug appears to be related to how the version information is read and formatted.

The error message shows that the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of the expected "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This implies that the `proc.stdout.read()` call is not correctly retrieving just the version number.

The `proc.stdout.read()` call returns bytes of data, which then are decoded to string using `decode('utf-8')` and stripped of whitespace. It seems like the decoding and stripping process is not correctly extracting the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the decoding and stripping process for extracting and formatting the version number correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

The corrected version uses the `split(', ')` method to split the string "fish, version 3.5.9" into a list ['fish', 'version 3.5.9'] and then takes the last element using `[-1]` to extract "3.5.9". This ensures that the version number is correctly extracted and formatted, and the function should now return the expected output, passing the failing test.
