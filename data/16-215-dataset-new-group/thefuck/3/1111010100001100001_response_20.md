The bug in the given function is that it doesn't handle the subprocess correctly and doesn't wait for the process to finish before reading its output.

The current implementation of the function creates a subprocess to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` class from the `subprocess` module. It then reads the output from the subprocess and returns the version of the fish shell. However, it doesn't handle the subprocess properly and doesn't wait for it to finish before reading its output.

To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish before reading its output. We can achieve this by using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the subprocess to finish and then return its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly wait for the subprocess to finish before reading its output, fixing the bug.
