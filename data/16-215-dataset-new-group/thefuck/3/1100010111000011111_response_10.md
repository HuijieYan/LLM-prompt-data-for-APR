## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it uses the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, the test case expects the command 'fish --version' to be used, which is the correct way to retrieve the version. Additionally, the original function did not handle the output of the 'fish --version' command correctly.

The corrected version of the function uses the correct command to retrieve the version and properly parses the output to extract only the version number. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.

The corrected function should pass the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to triggering a recursive loop.
