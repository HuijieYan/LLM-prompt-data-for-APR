The issue with the given function `info` is that it is not reading the output of the `Popen` command correctly. It is expected to return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it's returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' due to the incorrect handling of the standard output from the Popen command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly capture the version string from the standard output. We can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read both standard output and standard error. Then, we modify the format string to extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the `info` function should now correctly capture the version string from the standard output and return the expected result, 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
