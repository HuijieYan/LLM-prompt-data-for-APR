## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version string from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The `info` function is currently returning the entire output, including the prefix "fish, version", instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug, the function should extract only the version number from the output and format it into the expected string format.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
