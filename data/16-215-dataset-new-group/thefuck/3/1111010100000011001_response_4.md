## Fixing the buggy function

The issue in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the return value of the Popen process and the decoding of the output. The function is also not handling the potential errors that may occur during the Popen process.

Here's a fixed version of the function that addresses the issues:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, CalledProcessError
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except CalledProcessError as e:
            return 'Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}'.format(e)
```

In the fixed version:
1. We added a try-except block to catch any potential errors that may occur during the Popen process.
2. We used `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the output of the Popen process instead of `proc.stdout.read()` to properly handle the process output.
3. We added error handling in case of a `CalledProcessError` to provide a meaningful error message.

This should address the issues and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
