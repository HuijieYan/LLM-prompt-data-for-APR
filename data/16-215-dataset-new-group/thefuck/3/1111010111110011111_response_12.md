The buggy function `info` is not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, resulting in a mismatch between the actual version retrieved and the expected version. The faulty command to retrieve the version as seen in the `info` function is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which does not provide the correct version string expected by the test function (`fish, version 3.5.9`).

To fix the bug, the command to retrieve the version should be changed to `fish --version` in the `info` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # fixed info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the above correction, the `info` function should now retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
