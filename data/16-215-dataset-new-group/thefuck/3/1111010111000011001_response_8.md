The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the fish shell version is incorrect. The Popen command should use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used in the Popen call to `['fish', '--version']` to get the version of the fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
