The buggy function "info" in the class "Fish" is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing its output. However, the bug lies in the way the output from the subprocess is being read and decoded.

The potential error locations are:
1. Reading the subprocess output without waiting for the process to finish executing.
2. Using `decode('utf-8')` on the output without error handling.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not waiting for the subprocess to finish executing before attempting to read its output, and it's not handling any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate` method of the subprocess to wait for it to finish executing and then read the output. Additionally, we should add error handling to handle any potential issues with the subprocess execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            return "Failed to retrieve Fish shell version"
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `communicate` method to wait for the subprocess to finish executing and capture its output. We also check the `returncode` of the subprocess to handle any potential errors during its execution.
