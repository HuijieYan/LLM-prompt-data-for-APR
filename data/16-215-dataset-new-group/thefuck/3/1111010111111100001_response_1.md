The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the version of the shell. It's currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` but it should be using `fish --version` based on the error message from the failing test.

To fix the bug, update the command used in the `info` function to retrieve the version of the shell. 

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
