The buggy function `info` in fish.py is causing a recursive loop when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used with the "thefuck -v" command. This is due to the use of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop in the `Fish.info()` function. 

To fix the bug, the Popen call needs to be updated to prevent the recursive loop. We can directly check if the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is present and return the shell name and version accordingly. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if 'FISH_VERSION' in os.environ:
        version = os.environ['FISH_VERSION']
    else:
        version = 'unknown'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function directly checks if the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is present and returns the shell name and version based on that. This will avoid the recursive loop issue caused by using `thefuck -v`.
