## Corrections
Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue is caused by the form of the version string being returned from the shell. The returned string includes additional text "fish, version" which is causing the assertion error.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the returned string. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

By modifying the returned version string to extract only the version number, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
