The issue with the buggy function is that it is reading the stdout before it is completed. This is causing the function to return an incorrect version.

To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading the stdout. We can do this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which will wait for the process to terminate and then return a tuple containing the stdout and stderr.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version will return the expected version of the Fish shell based on the input parameters and the expected values of the variables provided.
