The cause of the bug is that the 'fish' command is being used to get the version, but it should be '--version'. Additionally, the 'echo' command is used instead of '--version', which causes the output to be incorrect.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the command passed to Popen to get the version of the Fish shell. The correct command should be 'fish --version' rather than 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. Additionally, the return value should be parsed to extract the version number from the output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.split(",")[1].strip()  # Extracting version number from output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
