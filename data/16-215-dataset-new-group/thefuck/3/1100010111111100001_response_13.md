The bug in the `info` function is due to the use of the wrong command to get the Fish shell version, and the incorrect parsing of the output. The error message also shows that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, while the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the command used to fetch the version is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the version of the Fish shell should be updated to `'fish --version'`, and the output parsing should be adjusted to extract only the version number. This will ensure that the expected and actual outputs match, resolving the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
