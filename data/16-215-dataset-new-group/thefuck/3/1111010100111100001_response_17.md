The bug in the provided function is that the function is not properly reading the output from the Popen command. This is evident from the error message, which shows that the expected output has the version number, but the actual output includes more than just the version number.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the output from the Popen command. Instead of just extracting the version number from the output, it is including additional information.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly extract the version number from the output of the Popen command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split('version ')[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should properly extract the version number from the output of the Popen command and return the expected result.
