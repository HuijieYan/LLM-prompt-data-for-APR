### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `info` function is not properly reading the output from the `Popen` command.
2. The `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` returns a string with the incorrect version of the shell.

### Cause of the bug:
The `info` function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the `Popen` command. This is causing the incorrect version number to be returned, leading to the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the way the `Popen` output is read and decoded to ensure that the correct version number is extracted.
2. Change the formatting of the version string to ensure a proper output.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell ' + version
```

With the corrected version of the function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
