The potential error in the buggy function is the command used in Popen to get the Fish version. The test is expecting the version to be obtained using the command ['fish', '--version'], but the Popen command inside the info function is using ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'].

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command inside the info function is not retrieving the Fish version correctly, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen in the info function needs to be changed to ['fish', '--version'] to match the expectations of the test. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the test should now pass as it expects the version to be obtained using the command ['fish', '--version'], which matches the command used in the corrected info function. This fix also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub thread by ensuring that the version retrieval does not cause a recursive loop.
