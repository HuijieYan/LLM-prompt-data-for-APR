The bug in the code is in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file. The function is trying to get the version of Fish shell by executing `echo $FISH_VERSION` command and capturing the output. However, the command being executed is incorrect, and hence the version is not being captured properly. This leads to the failing test and the corresponding error message.

To fix this bug:
- Update the command being executed in the `info` function to capture the correct version of Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, with the corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values will be satisfied. This fix also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
