## Analysis
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected output and the actual output. It seems that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the version along with some additional text, which is causing the assertion to fail.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `info` function where the command is executed using `Popen`. The command is returning extra text along with the version, causing the assertion to fail.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not returning just the version, it is returning additional text which is causing the assertion to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the command output returned by `Popen` needs to be parsed to extract only the version. This can be done by splitting the output and extracting the version from it.

## The corrected version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    # Split the output by comma and space to extract the version
    version = output.split(', version ')[1]
    
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
