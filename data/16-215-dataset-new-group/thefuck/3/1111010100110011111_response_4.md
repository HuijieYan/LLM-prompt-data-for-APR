## The cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version information obtained from the Fish shell. The `info` function is expected to extract the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and format it as 'Fish Shell {version}'. However, the current implementation is not correctly parsing the version information and is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version {version}' instead of 'Fish Shell {version}'.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and format it as 'Fish Shell {version}'. This can be achieved by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to retrieve the output and then correctly formatting the version information.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function should properly parse the version information and return the expected output. This will resolve the issue posted on GitHub and also satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
