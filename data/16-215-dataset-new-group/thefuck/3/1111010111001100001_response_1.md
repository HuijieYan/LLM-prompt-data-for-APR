The bug in the given function is that the command being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, and the way the output is being read is also incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed to get the version of Fish shell is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which is not the correct way to get the version information. Additionally, the assertion in the test case is also expecting the command ['fish', '--version'] to be executed, which is not being executed in the buggy function.

To fix the bug, the correct command to get the version of Fish shell should be used, and the way the output is read should also be corrected to handle the output properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)

        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test case.
