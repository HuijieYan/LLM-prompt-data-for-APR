## Fixing the buggy function

The bug in the `info` function is caused by not waiting for the `Popen` process to finish before reading the stdout. This can lead to the output not being available when trying to read it.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the process to finish and then read the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `communicate` method, we ensure that the process has finished before trying to read the output, fixing the bug that caused the incorrect behavior of the function.
