## Explanation
The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. However, it uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but the test is passing `fish, version 3.5.9\n` which does not match the expected output format.

The GitHub issue indicates that the problem arises when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, causing a recursive loop.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function in the `Fish` class to correctly parse the output of `fish --version` or similar command to get the version number of the Fish shell.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# Import the necessary modules
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache


# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
