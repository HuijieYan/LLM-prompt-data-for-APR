The bug in the `info` function of the Fish class is caused by the command used to get the Fish shell version and the subsequent formatting of the version string. The `Popen` call uses the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version, but the test is looking for the output of `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the version string retrieved from the command includes extraneous text that needs to be removed.

To fix the bug, the command used in the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expectations of the test. Then, the retrieved version string needs to be parsed to extract only the version number itself, discarding any additional text.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function in the Fish class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
