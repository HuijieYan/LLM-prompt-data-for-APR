The bug in the given function is that it returns the entire string 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just the version number '3.5.9' when calling the `info` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to only return the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the `info` function will now correctly return only the version number and will pass the failing test.
