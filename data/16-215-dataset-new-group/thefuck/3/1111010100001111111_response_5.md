The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the `Popen` function to get the version of the Fish shell, but it's not getting the expected value. This is causing a recursive loop issue in Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, as described in the GitHub issue.
The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not returning the expected version format, and this is causing the recursive loop in the plugin.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used by `Popen` to get the version of the Fish shell. We should change the command to get the full version information of Fish shell and format it accordingly to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will return the expected version information of the Fish shell, which should resolve the recursive loop issue described in the GitHub issue.
