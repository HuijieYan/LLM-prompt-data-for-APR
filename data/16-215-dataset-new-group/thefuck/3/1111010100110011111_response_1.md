The issue is caused by the `info` function in the `Fish` class, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` class to execute a command to get the version, but it incorrectly processes the output, resulting in an incorrect version string and failing the test.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly processing the output of the command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function is returning the entire command output including the prefix "fish, version" instead of only the version number, which causes the assertion error in the test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly process the output of the command to extract the version number and return it in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function processes the output of the command to extract only the version number and returns it in the expected format, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
