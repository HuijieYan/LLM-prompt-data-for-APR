The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command to get the version information. However, the function is not correctly capturing the version information and formatting it into the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly parsing the output of the command to extract the version information. Instead, it is directly using the entire output as the version, which is causing the assertion error in the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly extract the version from the output of the command and format it into the expected output format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', version ')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should properly extract the version information from the output of the command and format it into the expected output. This should resolve the failing test case.
