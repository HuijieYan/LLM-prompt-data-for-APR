The buggy function returns the output in the wrong format, which causes the failing test. The `info` function of the `Fish` class calls the `Popen` function with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. The expected version string is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the function is currently extracting just '3.5.9' from the output and formatting it with 'Fish Shell' as a prefix. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to capture the complete version string from the output and format it as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. You can achieve this by updating the command to `['fish', '--version']` and modifying the string processing to handle the complete version string.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
