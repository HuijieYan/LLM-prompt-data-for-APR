## Analysis
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, the Fish shell. The function opens a subprocess to execute a command and capture the output. However, based on the error message, it appears that the returned version is not correctly formatted, and there is a mismatch in the comparison.

## Identification of Potential Error Locations
The bug is most likely related to the way the version string is processed and formatted.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is due to the fact that the version string obtained from `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` contains additional text ("fish, version") that is not being accounted for when formatting the output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
A potential fix would involve modifying the way the version string is obtained from the Popen call and then properly formatted to match the expected format.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
