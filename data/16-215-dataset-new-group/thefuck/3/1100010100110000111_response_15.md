## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the buggy function is with the `Popen` call. It seems that the error lies in appending "fish" into the `Popen` argument, which doesn't seem to be necessary in this context. Additionally, the decoding of the stdout and stripping may also be causing the bug.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the corresponding error message, the GitHub Issue information
The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using `Popen`. However, it incorrectly appends "fish" to the `Popen` argument, which causes the command to fail and produce the incorrect output. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual version, which triggers the failing test.

The GitHub issue also mentions a recursive loop caused by the `info` function, which may indicate that the incorrect command being run leads to unexpected behavior and could potentially cause a recursive loop.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be adjusted to run the correct command for retrieving the Fish shell version. Additionally, the decoding and stripping of the stdout should be handled properly to obtain the version string without any extra characters or whitespace.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['echo', '$FISH_VERSION'],
                 shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the call to `Popen` has been adjusted to correctly run the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The `shell` parameter is set to `True` to enable the shell to interpret the command, and the argument list has been modified accordingly. Additionally, the decoding and stripping of the stdout have been retained to obtain the version string in the expected format.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
