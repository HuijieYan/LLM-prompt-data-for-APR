The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This causes the function to return the wrong version number.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
