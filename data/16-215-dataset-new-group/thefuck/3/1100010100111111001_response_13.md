The cause of the bug is that the function is not capturing the correct version of the Fish shell from the output of the Popen command. The expected version is 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the function is only capturing '3.5.9' from the output.

To fix the bug, the function should capture the entire output of the Popen command and then extract the version from it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function captures the entire output of the Popen command, extracts the version using the `split` method, and returns the correct version of the Fish shell. This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
