The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, while the test is expecting the command `fish --version` to be used.

To fix this bug, the function `info` needs to be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish version.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
