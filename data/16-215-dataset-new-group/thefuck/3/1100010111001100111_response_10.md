## Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug occurs because the command used to fetch the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. The original code uses "echo $FISH_VERSION" which is not the correct way to obtain the version. By changing the command to "fish --version", we can fetch the correct version and fix the bug.

With the corrected version, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. This will resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
