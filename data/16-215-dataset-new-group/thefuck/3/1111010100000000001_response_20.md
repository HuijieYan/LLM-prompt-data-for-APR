# Analysis:
The buggy function "info" is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the "Popen" method from the subprocess module to execute a command ('fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION') and capture the output. However, the way it interacts with the subprocess and handles the output could lead to potential errors.

# Identified potential error locations:
1. The "Popen" method might not be capturing the output correctly.
2. The function does not handle exceptions if the command execution fails.
3. There is no error handling for cases where the "FISH_VERSION" environment variable is not set.

# Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is likely caused by not properly handling the output from the subprocess. It may also fail to handle exceptions and errors that can occur during the execution of the shell command. Additionally, if the 'FISH_VERSION' environment variable is not set, the function will not handle this case gracefully.

# Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the "communicate()" method to properly capture the output from the subprocess.
2. Add exception handling to catch any errors that may occur during command execution.
3. Check if the 'FISH_VERSION' environment variable is set, and handle the case gracefully if it is not.

# Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):


    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            
            if proc.returncode == 0:
                version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
            else:
                return "Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version"
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```
In the corrected version, the "communicate()" method is used to capture the output, and exception handling is added to catch any errors during command execution. It also checks the return code of the process to handle cases where the command execution fails.
