The buggy function fails to return the correct version of the Fish shell, and this causes the failing test due to an assertion error. The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call is using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, resulting in a mismatch in the expected and actual values. The failing test expects the version number to be extracted using the command 'fish --version', but the buggy function is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call in the `info` function should be updated to use 'fish --version' in order to correctly extract the version number of the Fish shell.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
