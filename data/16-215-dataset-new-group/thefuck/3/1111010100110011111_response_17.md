The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class from the `fish.py` file is using the `Popen` method to get the version of the Fish shell, but it is not properly decoding the output and formatting the result. This results in the incorrect output and causes the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the `version` variable is not decoded properly from the `stdout` of the `Popen` process, and the formatting of the result is incorrect. This leads to the assert statement failing in the test because the actual output includes unwanted characters.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to properly decode the `stdout` and format the output as `Fish Shell x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is the actual version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove unwanted characters
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function properly decodes the version from the `stdout` and formats the output as expected. This should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
