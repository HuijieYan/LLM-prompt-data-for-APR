### Correction

The issue with the `info` function is that it uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version number, but instead, it should use `fish --version`. Also, there is a discrepancy between the command used in the function and the command being checked in the test function. 

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command for getting the version number, and the test function should be updated to check for the correct command as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract the version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

And the corrected version of the failing test:

```python
    def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
        assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
        assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']  # Updated to check for the correct command
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly retrieve the version number of the Fish shell, and the test should pass without any assertion errors. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
