The bug in the provided function is that the output of the Popen process is not being decoded or stripped correctly, resulting in the unexpected output of the `info` function.

The `info` function is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell in a specific format. However, the bug causes the function to return the version in a different format, leading to a failing test.

To fix the bug, the output of `proc.stdout.read()` needs to be decoded and stripped correctly before formatting it into the desired output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

The corrected version decodes the output of `proc.stdout.read()` and then extracts the version using the `split` function. This will correctly format the output to match the expected value in the failing test.
