The buggy function attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by using the Popen function from the subprocess module to execute a command and read its output. However, the potential error lies in the way it is reading the output of the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is reading the output of the process using `proc.stdout.read()`, but it does not wait for the process to finish. This can lead to a race condition where the command output is not yet available at the time of reading.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to wait for the process to finish and then read its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
