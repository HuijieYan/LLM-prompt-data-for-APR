The buggy function `info` is meant to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is failing to do so because it is not correctly parsing the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

The test function `test_info` is failing because the actual output from the `shell.info()` call is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as expected.

The variable `version` in the `info` function is derived from the output of the Popen command, which is being read from `proc.stdout.read()`. This seems to be where the issue is occurring.

The GitHub issue provides more context on how this bug is affecting the functionality of the program, specifically causing a recursive loop due to an interaction with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command and return it in the specified format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix includes splitting the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command by space and taking the last element as the version number.

This corrected version should address the parsing issue and return the expected version number, resolving the failing test and the GitHub issue.
