The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it's returning the version in a different format than the expected format. The returned string is "Fish Shell 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

To fix this bug, the `info` function should be modified to extract the version in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

This corrected version should now return the version in the correct format and pass the failing test.
