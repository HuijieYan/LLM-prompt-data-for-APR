Based on the analysis, the bug in the current function `info` is caused by reading the wrong value from the process output. The code is expecting the output to be "fish, version 3.5.9" but instead, it's just "3.5.9".

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to extract the correct version from the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version.split()[-1]}'
```

In the corrected version, I've changed the command from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version` to get the correct version string. Then, I've modified the code to extract the version number from the output and return the formatted string "Fish Shell <version>". This should resolve the issue and the failing test.
