The potential error in the buggy function is that it's trying to get the Fish version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but in the failing test, it's asserting that the command being called is `fish --version`. This mismatch in the command being called and the one being asserted is likely causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to execute the correct command (`fish --version`) and also update the assertion in the failing test to match the new command being called.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

And the corrected version of the failing test:

```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these corrections, the buggy function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
