Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is caused by the function not capturing the correct output of the shell command that is executed. It appears that the function is not reading the output correctly from the `proc` variable.

To fix this bug, we need to capture the output of the shell command correctly and then format it into the expected return value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `communicate()` method is used to capture the output of the shell command correctly. This ensures that the function reads the output from the `proc` variable and formats it into the expected return value.

This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
