## Potential error locations within the buggy function
There could be potential errors in the way the version is extracted from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. Additionally, the encoding of the output when it is read could be causing issues.


## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output was 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This means that the version string is not being extracted properly from the command output.


## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version is extracted from the command output. We should adjust the command so that it only outputs the version number without any additional text. Additionally, we should ensure that the encoding of the output is handled correctly.


## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read version from the output
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
        return 'Fish Shell ' + version
```

In the corrected version, we use the `['fish', '--version']` command to directly get the version of the Fish shell without needing to parse any environmental variables. Then, we extract the version number from the output and return the formatted string. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
