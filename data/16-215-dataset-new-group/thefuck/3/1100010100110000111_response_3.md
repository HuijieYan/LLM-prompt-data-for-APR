## The analysis of the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell, which leads to a failing test. The failing test indicates that the returned version string includes extra information, causing the assertion to fail.

The GitHub issue also confirms that there is a problem with the `Fish.info()` function and that it triggers a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is used. This issue is related to how the version of the Fish shell is being captured.

## Identifying potential error locations

The potential error in the `info` function lies in the way the version information is being extracted from the Popen process. It seems that the string "fish, version " is included in the output and is causing the assertion to fail.

## Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the `stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` is not correctly capturing only the version number from the Popen process output. This leads to the extra characters "fish, version " being included in the returned version string.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version information is being extracted from the Popen process output. We should consider using regular expressions or string manipulation to capture only the version number.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number using regex
    try:
        version = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', version_output).group()
    except AttributeError:
        version = ''
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `re` module to search for a version number pattern in the `version_output` string. If a version number is found, it is returned; otherwise, an empty string is returned. This approach ensures that only the version number is included in the returned string, resolving the bug.
