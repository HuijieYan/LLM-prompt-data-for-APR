The bug in the provided function is causing the test to fail. The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, however, it is not formatting the version correctly. The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The buggy line is:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
The function does not correctly process the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, as it does not remove the "fish, version" prefix and only takes the version string. To fix this, the prefix "fish, version" should be removed from the output.

The corrected function will remove the prefix "fish, version" from the output of the command and then format it with the correct label ("Fish Shell") and version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this modification, the test should pass, and the function should return the correct output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.
