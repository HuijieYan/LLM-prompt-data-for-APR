After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `shell.info()` call is returning an unexpected value, causing an assertion error.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function. The failing test and the error message suggest that the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not being properly parsed, as it returns `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`.

To fix the bug, the parsing of the shell version retrieved from the command output should be modified. The correct version should be extracted from the output and properly formatted as a string.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is changed to `['fish', '--version']`. This will directly provide the version string without the need for additional parsing. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
