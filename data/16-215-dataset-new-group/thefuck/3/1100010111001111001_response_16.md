The bug in the `info` function is that it is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it should be using `fish --version` instead. This causes the test to fail because the expected version and the version obtained by the function are different.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `fish --version` and extracting the version from the output, the function will return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
