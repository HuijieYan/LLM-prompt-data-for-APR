The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the output of the Popen process. The function is expecting the output to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' and is trying to strip the version number from it, but the actual output is '3.5.9', without the 'fish, version' prefix.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly parse the version from the output of the Popen process, and then format it into the desired output format.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
