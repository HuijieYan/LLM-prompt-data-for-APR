The issue here is that the `info` function is not correctly extracting the version of the Fish shell from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The error message shows that the expected value is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual value is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the command output as a string and not correctly handling the version extraction from the output.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to parse the version string properly and format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should successfully extract the version number and format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'. This should allow the function to pass the failing test.
