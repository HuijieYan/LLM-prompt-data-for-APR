To fix the bug in the `info` function, we need to modify the `Popen` command to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The current command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` does not return the actual version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
- The original command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` was replaced with `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
- The output of `proc.stdout.read()` is decoded and stripped to obtain the version information.
- We then extract the actual version number from the output using `split()[-1]`.
- The corrected function now returns a string in the format 'Fish Shell x.x.x', where x.x.x is the actual version number.

This corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.

Additionally, this fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub post titled "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin" by providing a solution to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect behavior of the `info` function.
