The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It should be using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` and then decode the output accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and return the correct Fish shell version.
