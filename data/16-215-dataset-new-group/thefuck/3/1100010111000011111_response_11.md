## The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect shell command used in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file. The function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it is using the incorrect command to do so, causing the test to fail. This bug has been identified and reported in the GitHub issue as well, with a fix on the way.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to execute the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This will ensure that the function returns the expected version and passes the failing test.

## A corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])  # Extracting the version from the output
```
