Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug lies in the info function within the Fish class in the file shells/fish.py. The bug was reported in the GitHub issue titled "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin" and the cause was identified as a recursive loop triggered by the command thefuck -v, which uses the info function.

The cause of this bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to get the fish version. The test is asserting that the command used is ['fish', '--version'], while the Popen call in the info function uses ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] instead.

To fix this bug, the Popen call should be updated to use the correct command to get the fish version. The corrected version of the function is shown below.

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the info function should now return the expected fish version. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensures the test passes successfully.
