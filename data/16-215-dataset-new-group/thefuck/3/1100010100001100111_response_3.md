### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `info` function is caused by the way it retrieves the version of the Fish Shell. It uses the `Popen` class to open a new process to run the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and retrieve the version. However, the issue on GitHub indicates that this approach causes a recursive loop when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish, as it triggers the initialisation of Fish Shell and causes the recursive loop.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell in a way that does not trigger the recursive loop when used with the `thefuck` plugin in Oh-My-Fish.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = ''  # Set default version to empty string
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    except:
        pass
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version of the function, the `communicate()` method is used instead of `read()` to retrieve the output of the `fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION` command. This approach avoids triggering the recursive loop and provides a safer way to retrieve the Fish Shell version. If an exception occurs during the process, the default version is set to an empty string.
