The bug in the `info` function is that it is not capturing the correct version of the fish shell. The current implementation captures the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, which might not be set in all cases. Instead, we should run `fish --version` to capture the shell version.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command to `fish --version` and capture the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
