The buggy function `info` is trying to get the version of the Fish shell installed, but it fails to do so and returns the wrong result.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly extract the version of the Fish shell from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The returned version includes additional text and characters, making the comparison with the expected version fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly extract the version number from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `.split(", version ")[-1]` is added to extract only the version number from the output of the command. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct version of the Fish shell.
