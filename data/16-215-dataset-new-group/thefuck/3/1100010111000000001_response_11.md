The potential error in the buggy function is that the command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' whereas in the test it is being asserted with 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This suggests that the command to retrieve the version is wrong.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version in the 'info' function does not match the command for the version in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command for retrieving the Fish shell version should be changed to 'fish --version'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
