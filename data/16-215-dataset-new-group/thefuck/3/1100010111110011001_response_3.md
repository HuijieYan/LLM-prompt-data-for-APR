## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

In the original function, the command used to get the Fish shell version was incorrect, and the parsing of the output was also incorrect. The correct command to get the version is `fish --version`, and the version can be extracted by splitting the output string and taking the last element.

By making these adjustments, the function now correctly retrieves and formats the Fish shell version, passing the failing test and returning the expected output.
