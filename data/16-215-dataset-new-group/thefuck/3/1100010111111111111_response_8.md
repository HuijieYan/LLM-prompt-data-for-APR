The buggy function `info` is incorrectly retrieving the Fish shell version and formatting it. This leads to the failing test showing a mismatch between the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This results in the version string being prefixed with `'fish, version'.`

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This will correctly retrieve the version of Fish shell without any additional text.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extracting the version number from the full response
    version = version.split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and format it as `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, thereby passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
