Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the `info` function in the `Fish` class. The failing test `test_info` is not passing because the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output includes the extra text `'fish, version'`. This indicates that the function is not correctly parsing the version information from the shell.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the way the `Popen` command is being used to retrieve the version information from the fish shell. It seems that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not providing the expected version format.

To fix the bug, instead of relying on the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, we can directly use `fish --version` to get the correct fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number from the output
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The updated code uses `Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` to fetch the version directly. It then extracts and formats the version number before returning the result.

By implementing these changes, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the fish shell version and pass the failing test. This should also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the usage of `thefuck -v`.
