The bug in the info function of the Fish class is caused by the incorrect command being used to fetch the Fish version. Also, the return value is not formatted correctly. This is evident from the failing test in test_info where the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. Additionally, the GitHub issue mentions that the -v option for the `thefuck` plugin in Fish shell leads to a recursive loop, which indicates that the version fetching process in the info function is not working as intended.

To fix the bug, the command should be modified to `['fish', '--version']` and the format of the version string should be adjusted to match the expected output format.

Here's the corrected version of the info function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # Corrected version of the info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the test_info function should pass without any assertions. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop caused by the -v option in the `thefuck` plugin.
