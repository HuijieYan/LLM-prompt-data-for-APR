The issue with the current version of the `info` function in `fish.py` is that it's using the wrong command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) to retrieve the Fish shell's version. This causes the test to fail because it expects the version to be retrieved with the command `fish --version`.

Based on the failing test case and the information from the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug is that the info function is using the incorrect command to obtain the Fish shell version. The failing test expects the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`, but the info function is using a different command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function in `fish.py`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function now uses the correct command `fish --version` to retrieve the Fish shell version, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
