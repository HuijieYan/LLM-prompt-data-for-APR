The `info` function in the `Fish` class is not returning the expected result because the command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. The Popen command is using the argument `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version`'. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen command with the correct argument to retrieve the Fish shell version. Also, as per the failing test, we need to change the assertion check value.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[2])
```

With this correction, the updated `info` function should return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` as expected by the failing test.
