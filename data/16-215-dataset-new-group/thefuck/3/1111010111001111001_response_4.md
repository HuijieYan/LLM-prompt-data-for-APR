The bug in the `info` function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function, but the expected output to capture the version is not being used. As a result, the returned version is not accurate, leading to failing test cases.

To fix this bug, the `Popen` command should be modified to run `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Then, the output should be captured and parsed to extract the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will run the correct command to get the Fish shell version and return the expected output, passing the failing test cases.
