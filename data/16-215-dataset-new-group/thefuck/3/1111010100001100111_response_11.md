The problem with the current implementation of the function `info` in the `Fish` class is that it is creating a subprocess to get the version of the Fish shell, but is not properly handling the output of the subprocess.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin with TheFuck, it triggers a recursive loop because of the `Fish.info()` function.

To fix this, we need to correctly handle the output from the subprocess and ensure that it does not trigger a recursive loop when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

Here's a corrected version of the function that addresses the issue:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method of the subprocess `proc` to read and close the stdout and stderr streams. This ensures that the subprocess is properly handled and does not lead to a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
