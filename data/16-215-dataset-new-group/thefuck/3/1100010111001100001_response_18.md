The bug in the `info` function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we should update the command that is being run to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
