The bug in the provided function is that it is not properly reading the output of the Popen process to capture the version of the Fish shell. This is evident from the incorrect values and types of variables at the function's return.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly reading the output from the Popen process and is failing to capture the version of the Fish shell.

To fix the bug, the function should properly read and decode the output from the Popen process to capture the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
