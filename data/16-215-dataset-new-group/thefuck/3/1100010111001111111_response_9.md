To fix the buggy function, we need to update the `info` function in the `fish.py` file to correctly fetch the Fish Shell version. The issue seems to be related to the command used to retrieve the version. 

The output of the failing test indicates that the expected version string has a different format than what the current implementation fetches. Therefore, let's update the command used to get the Fish Shell version to match the expected format.

We can modify the `info` function as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command to `fish --version` and extracting the version number from the output, we ensure that the `info` function returns the expected version string.

This fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
