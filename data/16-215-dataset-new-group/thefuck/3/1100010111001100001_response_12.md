The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. It is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version'. Additionally, it is not reading the output correctly. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the version and correctly read the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extracting just the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
