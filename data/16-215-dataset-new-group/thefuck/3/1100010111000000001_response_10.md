The buggy function's purpose is to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell in this case). It uses the Popen function to execute the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' and retrieve the version number from the stdout.

However, the test function expects the version number to be retrieved using the command 'fish --version', and the assertion also checks for the call arguments of Popen. This indicates that the command being executed in the info() function is different from what the test is expecting.

To fix the bug, the Popen call in the info() function needs to be modified to execute the 'fish --version' command instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. Additionally, the call_args assertion in the test function should be updated to reflect the correct command being executed.

Here is the corrected version of the info() function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the info() function should now pass the failing test.
