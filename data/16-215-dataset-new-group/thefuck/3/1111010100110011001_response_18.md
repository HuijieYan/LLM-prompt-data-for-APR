The bug in the `info` function is that it's not properly extracting the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The current implementation is returning the entire output string instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output and format it properly.

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Extract just the version number from the output
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract the version number and format it as expected.
