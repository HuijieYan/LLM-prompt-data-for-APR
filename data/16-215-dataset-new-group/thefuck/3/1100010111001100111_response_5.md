## Explanation
The bug in the `info` function is that the command used to get the fish version is incorrect, and it is also not matching the expected output in the test.

The test is expecting the command `fish --version` to be called, but the function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This mismatch in the command being run and the expected output of the test is causing the test to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to update the command being run by the `Popen` function to `fish --version`, and then parse the output to extract the version number. This will make the function align with the expectations of the test and resolve the bug.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_str.split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function will correctly execute the command `fish --version` and parse the output to extract the version number. This will align it with the expectations of the test and resolve the bug.
