The bug in the provided function `info` is causing the unexpected output `Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9` instead of the expected output `Fish Shell 3.5.9`. This is because the function is not correctly parsing the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the command output correctly and is returning a string with 'fish, version' appended to the actual version number.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly parse the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should now correctly parse the version number and return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected.
