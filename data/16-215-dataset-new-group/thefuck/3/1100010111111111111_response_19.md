The issue with the `info` function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output. However, the expected output of this command is not matching the actual output, causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function `info` is trying to retrieve the version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the expected output is `fish, version 3.5.9`. This mismatch in the expected and actual output is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function `info` to capture the version correctly, so it matches the expected output from the test. We can modify the Popen command to `['fish', '--version']` to accurately capture the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Extract the version from the command output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This modified version of the function should capture the correct version of the Fish shell, matching the expected output from the failing test, and resolving the GitHub issue.
