The bug in the 'info' function is that it is not executing the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version. Instead of using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', it should be 'fish --version' to get the correct version information.

To fix this bug, the 'info' function needs to be updated to execute the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the 'info' function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(" ")[2])
```

With this corrected version, the 'info' function will now execute the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version and return the expected result. This should resolve the failing test and the corresponding error message.
