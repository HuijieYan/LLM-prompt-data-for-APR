### Cause of the bug
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then formatting it as "Fish Shell version". The error occurs because the output of the command includes extra text "fish, version" that is not handled properly, causing the assertion to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the output of the command and extract only the version number before formatting it as "Fish Shell version".

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version from output
    version = output.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
