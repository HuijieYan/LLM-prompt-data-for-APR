## Bugs Analysis
The bug occurs in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, when the `thefuck -v` command is used, it triggers a recursive loop due to an issue with the `Fish.info()` function. This causes the Fish shell to hang during initialization when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations are:
1. Use of Popen to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`
2. Reading the stdout of the process using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop due to an issue with the `info` function in the `fish.py` file. The function uses Popen to execute the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to retrieve the Fish shell version. However, this causes the recursive loop issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to find an alternative method to retrieve the Fish shell version without causing a recursive loop. This could involve finding a different command or API to get the version information and updating the `Fish.info` function to use this alternative method.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `subprocess.check_output` function is used to directly get the version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
