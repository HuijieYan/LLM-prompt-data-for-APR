The potential error in the buggy function is the use of the incorrect command to fetch the Fish Shell version. The call to Popen is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` which is causing the test to fail.

The buggy function is not returning the expected version of the Fish shell and instead is returning a custom modified string.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to use the correct command to fetch the Fish Shell version, which is `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by using the incorrect command.
