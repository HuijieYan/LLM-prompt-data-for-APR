## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function was caused by using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. This resulted in the test expecting a different output than what was actually being returned. The corrected version of the function uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and extracts the version number from the output string.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
