## Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. The expected output for this command includes "fish, version" followed by the actual version number. However, the current implementation of the function only captures the version number, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly capture the entire output and parse the version number from it.

## Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', version ')[-1]  # Extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the function to capture the entire output and correctly parse the version number, the corrected version should now return the expected output and pass the failing test.
