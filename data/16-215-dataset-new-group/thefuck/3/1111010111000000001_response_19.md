# Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function 'info' is caused by passing the wrong arguments to the Popen function when trying to get the version of the fish shell. The '--version' argument should be used instead of '-c' and 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Change the arguments passed to the Popen function to ['fish', '--version'] to execute the correct command and extract the version of the fish shell.

The corrected version of the buggy function has been provided above, which uses the correct arguments and should pass the failing test.
