The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version, and the output format needs to be parsed correctly.

The function currently uses the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the version, but the correct command to get the Fish shell version is `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the output of the version needs to be parsed to extract just the version number.

To fix the bug, Update the command to retrieve the Fish shell version and parse the output to extract just the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_raw = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_raw.split(' ')[2]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function will properly retrieve the Fish shell version and return it in the correct format. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass.
