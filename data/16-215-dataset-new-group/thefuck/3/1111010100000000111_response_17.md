## Analysis
The buggy function is in the `Fish` class within the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` module. The function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` class. However, this function is causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line might be causing the recursive loop.
2. The use of the `Popen` class without proper error handling might also be a potential issue.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing a recursive loop because the function `info` is being called when it is not expected to be, likely due to the way it interacts with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `info` function does not cause a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This might involve changing the way the function retrieves the shell name and version, and ensuring that it does not cause unexpected side effects when used in conjunction with Oh-My-Fish.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving shell information: {}".format(e)
```
In the corrected version, we have added proper error handling with a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions that might occur when running the `Popen` command. We have also used `proc.communicate()[0]` to retrieve the output of the process, which should help in avoiding any unexpected recursive loops.
