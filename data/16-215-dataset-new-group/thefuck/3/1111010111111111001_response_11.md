## Fixing the Bug
The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by using the wrong command to retrieve the shell version. The `Popen` call uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the expected version output is in the format `fish, version 3.5.9`.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should use the command `fish --version` to retrieve the correct shell version.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function in the `Fish` class should now return the correct shell version, satisfying the expected input/output values.
