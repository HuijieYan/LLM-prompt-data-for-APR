The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to fetch the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not using the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, it should use `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the Popen function to `fish --version` to match the expected output of the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `fish --version` command and pass the failing test.
