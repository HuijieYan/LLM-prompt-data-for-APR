Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue lies in the command being used to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` call is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version, but the expected output in the test is `fish, version 3.5.9`, which suggests that the correct command should be `['fish', '--version']`.

To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` needs to be changed to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should now successfully retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return the correct result, passing the failing test and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
