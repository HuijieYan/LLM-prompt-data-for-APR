To fix the bug in the `info` function, it looks like the issue is with the command being sent to the `Popen` function. The command should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of Fish shell and pass the failing test.
