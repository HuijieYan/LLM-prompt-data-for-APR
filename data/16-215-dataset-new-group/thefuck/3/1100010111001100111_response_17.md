## The cause of the bug:
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is not correctly retrieving the Fish shell version, causing the failing test. The `Popen` call is using the incorrect command to retrieve the version, resulting in the test failing.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
Update the `Popen` call to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
