### Potential error locations:
1. The use of `Popen` to execute the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.
2. Reading the output of the process using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` function in the `Fish` class. When the plugin uses the command `thefuck -v` to decide when to regenerate functions, it triggers a recursive loop because the `info` function is not properly handling the subprocess execution to get the Fish shell version.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess is executed correctly and its output is read properly without causing any recursive loops when the plugin uses `thefuck -v`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], 
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, encoding='utf-8')
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip())
```
