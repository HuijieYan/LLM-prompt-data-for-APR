The buggy function has been designed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by invoking the `fish` command using the subprocess `Popen` and then extracting the version from the output. It seems that the command used to retrieve the version is incorrect, as indicated by the failing test and the error message.

The failing test `test_info` sets up the `Popen` mock to return the output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when the `Popen` is called. The `info` function then retrieves this output and constructs the version string. However, the constructed version string is not correct, leading to an assertion error.

To fix this, we need to correct the Popen call to use the `--version` argument to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, rather than using `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, we should also remove the unnecessary space after 'Fish Shell' in the return statement.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# the corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell{}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function should successfully retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
