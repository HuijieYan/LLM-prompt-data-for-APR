The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect. The function is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, while the expected command should be 'fish --version'.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen needs to be corrected to 'fish --version' to retrieve the correct Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell, the function should now correctly retrieve the version and pass the failing test.
