The issue in the buggy function is that it is attempting to retrieve the Fish shell version by running the command "echo $FISH_VERSION", but the test is expecting the command "fish --version" to be used instead. This causes the function to fail and return an incorrect version.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to run the correct command "fish --version" to retrieve the version string.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected version string and pass the failing test.
