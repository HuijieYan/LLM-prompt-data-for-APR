## The fixed and updated version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function was caused by using the incorrect command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command does not return the correct version. The correct command to get the Fish shell version is `fish --version`.

By replacing the incorrect command with the correct one, the function will be able to retrieve the version of the Fish shell accurately.

This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub and also resolve the failing test case.
