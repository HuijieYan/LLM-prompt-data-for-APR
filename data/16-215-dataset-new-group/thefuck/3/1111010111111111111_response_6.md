## The bug

The `info` function within the `Fish` class in `shells/fish.py` is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish Shell, but it's not compatible with the output format of the command. As a result, the version returned by the function is incorrect, causing the test to fail.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to change the command used to get the version of the Fish Shell to make sure it captures the correct output format. Additionally, we need to decode the output to a string and modify the expected value of the test accordingly.

## The corrected version

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache


class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

This corrected version uses the `--version` flag to get the version of the Fish Shell, and then processes the output to extract the version number. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
