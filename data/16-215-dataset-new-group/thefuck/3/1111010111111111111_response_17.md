The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is failing to return the correct version of the Fish shell due to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output. The subprocess Popen call is not using the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version, and the actual test is expecting the version string to contain the phrase "Fish Shell" which is not part of the output from the Popen command.

To fix the bug, the subprocess Popen call should be corrected to use the command `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This will ensure that the correct version output is captured and formatted properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)

        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

With this correction, the `info` function should return the correct version of the Fish shell, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
