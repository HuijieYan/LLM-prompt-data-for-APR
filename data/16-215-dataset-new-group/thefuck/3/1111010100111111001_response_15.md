After analyzing the provided information, we have identified the cause of the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the `info` function reads the output of the `Popen` command and expects it to be in the format `'fish, version X.X.X'` where `X.X.X` is the version number. However, the actual output is `'3.5.9'` without the prefix `'fish, version'`. This causes the comparison to fail and results in the AssertionError.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to include the prefix `'fish, version'` when formatting the version number.

### Corrected version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell fish, version {}'.format(version)  # Fixed formatting issue
```

By adding the required prefix `'Fish Shell fish, version'` when formatting the version number, the function will now return the expected output and pass the failing test.
