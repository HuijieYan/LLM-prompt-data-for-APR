The buggy function `info` is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the current shell, but the test is using the command `fish --version` to get the version. This mismatch is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` so that it matches the command used in the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

After making this change, the test should pass.
