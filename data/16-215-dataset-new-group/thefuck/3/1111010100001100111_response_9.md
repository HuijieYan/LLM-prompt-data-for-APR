## Explanation
The issue seems to be related to a recursive loop triggered by the `info` function in the `Fish` class. The function is attempting to get the version of the current shell by running a command through the subprocess module, but it seems like this operation is causing a recursive loop and hanging the initialization process with Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to avoid the recursive loop caused by the `info` function. We can do this by not triggering the function when it is not required, i.e., when the plugin-thefuck is trying to regenerate functions.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if 'THEFUCK_SETTINGS' in os.environ:
            return u'Fish Shell'
        
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `'THEFUCK_SETTINGS'` environment variable is present, which indicates that the thefuck plugin is running. If it is present, we simply return the name of the shell without triggering the subprocess call. This should prevent the recursive loop from occurring.
