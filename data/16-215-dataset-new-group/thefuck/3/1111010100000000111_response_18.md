## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen` from the `subprocess` module. However, this causes a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, which triggers the issue reported on GitHub.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations are:
1. The use of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop
2. Improper handling of the shell version check

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the use of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop due to the implementation of the `info` function. This function is not properly handling the shell version check.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be modified to properly handle the shell version check and avoid recursive loops triggered by `thefuck -v`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
