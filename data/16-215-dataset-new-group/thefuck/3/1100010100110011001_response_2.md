## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function is returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This suggests that the `version` variable is not being correctly extracted from the output of the Popen command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly reading the output from the Popen command and is not stripping the unnecessary text from the `version` variable.

## Bug fix strategy
1. Ensure that the Popen command is executed correctly and the output is read properly.
2. Strip the unnecessary text from the `version` variable by removing "fish, version" and leaving just the version number.

## The corrected function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
