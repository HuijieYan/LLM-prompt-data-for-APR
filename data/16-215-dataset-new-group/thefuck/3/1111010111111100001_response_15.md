The buggy function `info` is not correctly reading the version of the Fish shell and formatting it into the expected output. The failing test is asserting that the function should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it's returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not correctly retrieving the version number from the Fish shell, and the formatting of the output is not meeting the expected format.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command to correctly retrieve the version number and adjust the formatting of the output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
