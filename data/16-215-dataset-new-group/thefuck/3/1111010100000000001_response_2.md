The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the current implementation has potential error locations:

1. The `proc.stdout.read()` may block indefinitely if the process has not finished or if there is a large amount of output, leading to a hung application.
2. The `proc` object is not being closed after reading the output, which could lead to resource leaks.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to use the `communicate` method provided by the `subprocess` module, which allows to read both `stdout` and `stderr` without risk of blocking. Additionally, the `proc` object should be properly closed to release system resources.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Failed to retrieve Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
        finally:
            if proc:
                proc.kill()
```

In the corrected version, the `communicate` method is used to read the output, and a `try...except...finally` block is used to properly handle the `Popen` process, ensuring that it is closed even if an exception occurs.
