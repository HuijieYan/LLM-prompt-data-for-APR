### Analysis
The `info()` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it appears to be using the incorrect command to retrieve the version, leading to issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Bug Cause
The `info()` function is executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version`.

### Bug Fix
Change the command being executed to `fish --version` to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
