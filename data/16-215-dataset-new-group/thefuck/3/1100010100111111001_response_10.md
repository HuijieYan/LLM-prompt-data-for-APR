The bug in the provided function is that it is incorrectly reading the output of the `Popen` command and formatting it as the shell version. This is causing the assertion error in the test case.

The cause of the bug can be identified by the fact that the `proc.stdout.read()` returns `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` which is not the expected shell version format '3.5.9'.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the function to correctly extract the version information from the output of the `Popen` command and format it as the shell version.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(", ")[1]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function would extract the version from the output of the `Popen` command and format it properly as the shell version. With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
