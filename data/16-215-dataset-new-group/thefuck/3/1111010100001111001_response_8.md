The bug in the provided function is that it is not properly capturing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. It then attempts to decode the output, but this might not be necessary as the `communicate()` method can be used to capture the output and error codes of the command.

Given the details provided, the expected input/output values are:

Expected case 1
- The values and types of buggy function's parameters
    - N/A
- Expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
    - proc, expected value: `<MagicMock name='Popen()' id='140050497243408'>`, type: `MagicMock`
    - version, expected value: `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, type: `str`
    - proc.stdout.read, expected value: `<MagicMock name='Popen().stdout.read' id='140050497377296'>`, type: `MagicMock`
    - proc.stdout, expected value: `<MagicMock name='Popen().stdout' id='140050497379088'>`, type: `MagicMock`

To fix the bug, the function can be modified to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly capture the output of the command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `communicate()` method, the output of the command is properly captured and decoded, satisfying the expected input/output values.
