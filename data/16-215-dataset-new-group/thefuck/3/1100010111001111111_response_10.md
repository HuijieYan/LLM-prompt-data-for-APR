The problem in the `info` function arises from the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The test case fails because the function `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` does not return the expected version of Fish shell.

The cause of the bug is that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` does not return the correct version of the Fish shell. This is evident from the expected and actual values of the variables when the test is executed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command to properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function uses the `['fish', '--version']` command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and then extracts the version information from the output. This should fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
