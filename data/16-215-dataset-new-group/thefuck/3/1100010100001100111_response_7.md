### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations in the given code are:
1. Reading the standard output of the Popen process without waiting for it to finish, which can lead to a hang.
2. The usage of the '-v' option in the `thefuck` command causing a recursive loop when used in conjunction with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is two-fold:
1. The information from the GitHub issue indicates that the usage of the `-v` option in the `thefuck` command triggers a recursive loop, which is likely due to the incorrect information being returned by the `info` function.
2. The `info` function is not handling the Popen process correctly by not waiting for it to finish, potentially leading to a hang.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the `info` function to properly wait for the Popen process to finish before reading its output.
2. Remove the usage of the `-v` option in the `thefuck` command to prevent the recursive loop.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `info` function is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Additionally, the usage of the `-v` option in the `thefuck` command should be removed to prevent the recursive loop.
