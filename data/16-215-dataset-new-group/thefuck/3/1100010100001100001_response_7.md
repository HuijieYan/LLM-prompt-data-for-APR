The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly reading the output from the Popen process and returning the version of the Fish shell. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the command.

The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` method is not being called correctly to retrieve the output of the command.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to properly retrieve the output of the command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `communicate()` method, we can properly retrieve the output of the command and return the correct version of the Fish shell.
