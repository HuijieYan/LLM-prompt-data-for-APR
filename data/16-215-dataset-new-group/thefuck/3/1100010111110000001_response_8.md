The bug in the provided code is that the command used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect and does not match the assertion in the test function. The `Popen` command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` should be `['fish', '--version']` to properly get the version of the Fish shell.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version')[1].strip())
```

This fix involves changing the command used to get the version of the Fish shell in the `Popen` call from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`. This change ensures that the correct version of Fish shell is obtained and the test case will pass.
