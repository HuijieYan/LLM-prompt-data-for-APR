The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly reading the output from the Popen process. 

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the Popen object and possibly not waiting for the process to finish before reading its output.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate` method of the Popen object, which will wait for the process to finish and then read its output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should accurately retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return the expected values.
