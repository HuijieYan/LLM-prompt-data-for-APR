The buggy function info(self) in fish.py executes a command to get the version of the Fish shell, but the output is not being parsed correctly, resulting in an incorrect version being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed to get the version of the shell is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version', which means the incorrect version is being extracted from the output.

To fix the bug, the command being executed to get the version of the shell needs to be 'fish --version'. Additionally, the output of the command needs to be properly parsed to get the version.

Here's the corrected version of the info(self) function in fish.py:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the test function should pass successfully as the correct version of the shell will be returned after executing the command.
