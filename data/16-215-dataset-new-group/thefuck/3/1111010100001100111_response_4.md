### Bug Analysis
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is using the `Popen` function to execute a command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, it seems to be causing a recursive loop issue when used in combination with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This could be due to the way the `Popen` function is being used to execute the command.

### Potential Error Locations
The issue could be related to how the subprocess is being executed and how the output is being handled.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by a recursive loop triggered when the `info` function is called by the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This likely happens because the way the subprocess is being executed and the output is being handled is causing a loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the subprocess's output is properly captured and the subprocess itself is terminated correctly. Using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object can help to achieve this.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, after calling the `Popen` function, the `communicate()` method is used to capture the output and properly handle the subprocess. This should address the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
