The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell. This results in the incorrect version being used to format the output in the `info` function.

To fix the bug, the command being passed to Popen should be updated to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `--version` option instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, we can capture the correct version of the Fish shell. Then, the `info` function formats the output correctly using the retrieved version. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
