## Correction:

The potential error location within the buggy function is the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. Additionally, the way the version is being processed before returning it might be causing the bug.

The cause of the bug is that the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" used to retrieve the Fish Shell version is returning additional information along with the version number, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to remove the extra information returned by the command and only keep the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_with_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_with_info.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version from the returned string
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract and return the version of the Fish Shell, which will resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
