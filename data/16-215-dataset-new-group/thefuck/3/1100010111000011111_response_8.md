## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
1. The original function was using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version, it was using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.
2. This mistake causes the function to return an incorrect version of the Fish shell, leading to the failing test.
3. The failing test expected the function to return the correct version of the Fish shell, but due to the incorrect command being used, it was not returning the expected value.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to change the command to get the Fish shell version to `fish --version` in the Popen call within the function.
5. The corrected version of the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
