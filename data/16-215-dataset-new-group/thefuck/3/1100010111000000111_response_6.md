The issue with the `info` function in the file `fish.py` is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect. The function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but it should be using `fish --version` instead.

The failing test `test_info` is trying to mock the stdout response of `Popen` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, but the `info` function is not calling `Popen` with the correct arguments.

To fix this bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `fish --version`, and the test `test_info` should pass as expected. This fix also resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v`.
