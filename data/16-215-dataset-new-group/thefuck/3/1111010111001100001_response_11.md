The bug in the function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The command should be `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it is using `fish --version` instead. This causes the test to fail because the expected version "3.5.9" does not match the actual version obtained using the incorrect command.

To fix the bug, update the command in the `info` function to `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test.
