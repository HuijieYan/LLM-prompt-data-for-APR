### Explanation
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is currently running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version, but the test is expecting the output of `fish --version` to be used. Additionally, the `stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is causing issues when retrieving the version number.

### Bug location
The bug is located in the `info` function where the command to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, and the decoding of the stdout is causing issues.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is using the wrong command and not processing the output correctly, leading to a mismatch with the expected version in the test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Replace the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` with `fish --version` to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Process the output of the command without using `stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

### The corrected version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
