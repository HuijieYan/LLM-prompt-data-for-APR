The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is not decoding the output from the `Popen` command properly. The `Popen` command is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the decoding of the output and formatting the return value is not done correctly. This results in an incorrect assertion failure when testing the `info` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` method is returning a byte-like object, but it is not being properly decoded to a string before formatting the return value.

To fix the bug, we need to decode the output from `proc.stdout.read()` using the `utf-8` encoding before formatting the return value.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should properly decode the output from the `Popen` command and format the return value, resolving the assertion failure in the test case.
