## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is using the `Popen` class to open a subprocess and then read the output to get the version of the fish shell. The potential error locations in the code are the handling of the subprocess and reading the output from it. The cause of the bug might be that the `Popen` subprocess is not being properly handled, leading to incorrect output.

## Bug
The bug in the code is caused by not waiting for the subprocess to finish before reading its output, which may result in an empty or incomplete output.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to wait for the subprocess to finish before reading its output by using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` class.

## The corrected version
```python
import io
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = io.TextIOWrapper(proc.stdout, encoding='utf-8').read().strip()
        proc.wait()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
