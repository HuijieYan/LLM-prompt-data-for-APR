## The Bug
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the test is failing because it's expecting the version number to be obtained using `fish --version`, so the command being run is incorrect.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the command being run should be changed to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):


    # this is the corrected version of the info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
