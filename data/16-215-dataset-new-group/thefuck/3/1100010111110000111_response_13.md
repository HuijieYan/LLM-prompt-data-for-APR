The potential error in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file is that it is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell, but the correct command should be `fish --version`. This is resulting in the failing test `test_info` as it is expecting the version string in a different format.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Corrected version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])  # Extract the version number from the output
```

By using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, and modifying the code to extract the version number from the command output, the corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
