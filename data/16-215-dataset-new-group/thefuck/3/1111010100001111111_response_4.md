To fix the bug in the `info` function, we need to handle the case where the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is not set. The bug is causing a recursive loop in the `thefuck` plugin for Oh-My-Fish, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To address this issue, we can add a check to see if the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is set. If it's not set, we can return a default version string.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        if not version:
            version = 'Unknown version'
            
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix checks if the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is empty or not set, and if so, it returns a default version string. This will prevent the recursive loop and address the issue reported on GitHub.
