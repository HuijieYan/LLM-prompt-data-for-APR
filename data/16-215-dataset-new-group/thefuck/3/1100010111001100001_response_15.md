The bug in the `info` function is due to the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the version and needs to be changed to `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, update the command in the Popen call to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this update, the `test_info` should now pass.
