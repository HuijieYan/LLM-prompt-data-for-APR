The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call from the `info` function is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`. This difference causes the `Popen` object to read the wrong output and results in the failing test. To fix this bug, the `Popen` call needs to be updated to use the correct command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

The corrected version should pass the failing test as it now uses the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
