## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The buggy function `info` was retrieving the fish version using an incorrect command. The corrected function now uses the command `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which would return the correct version of the Fish shell. This change is consistent with the arguments used in the failing test.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this change addresses the GitHub issue by fixing the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect command in the original function.
