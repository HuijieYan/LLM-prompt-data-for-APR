The issue seems to be related to the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command, which calls the `Fish.info()` function. The function retrieves the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` but seems to return an incorrect version, which leads to the recursive loop.

Based on the GitHub issue description, the fix is still on its way, but we can propose a potential strategy for fixing the bug.

The following strategy can be used to fix the bug:
1. Modify the command executed by `Popen` to capture the correct Fish shell version.
2. Ensure that the correct version is returned without triggering a recursive loop.
3. Test the fix to confirm that the recursive loop is no longer occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $version; and printf "\n$FISH_VERSION\n"'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split("\n")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `Popen` command is modified to capture the Fish shell version properly. By using the command `fish -c 'echo $version; and printf "\n$FISH_VERSION\n"'`, we can obtain the correct version of the Fish shell without triggering a recursive loop.
