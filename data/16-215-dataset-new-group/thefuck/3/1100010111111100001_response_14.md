## Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the code is the line where the `Popen` function is called to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. It seems that the command being executed is not fetching the correct version of the fish shell.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed using the `Popen` function. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not fetching the correct version of the fish shell, causing the test to fail when comparing the expected version with the actual version.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the command being executed by the `Popen` function to fetch the correct version of the fish shell.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, we can accurately fetch the version of the fish shell. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
