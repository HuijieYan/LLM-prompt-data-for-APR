The cause of the bug is that the info() function is returning the version number without the prefix "fish, version". This is causing the assertion error in the failing test because the expected value includes the "fish, version" prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to update the info() function to include the "fish, version" prefix in the returned string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now return the version with the correct prefix, resolving the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub, as the function now returns the expected version string for the Fish shell.
