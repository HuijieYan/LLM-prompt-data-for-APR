The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` subprocess to execute a command and capture the output, then formats the output to include the version information.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the command used with `Popen` to retrieve the version information of the shell. Additionally, the way the output is captured and decoded could be causing the bug.

The cause of the bug is that the command used with `Popen` to retrieve the version information of the shell does not match the command used in the failing test. The failing test expects `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` as the output, but the command in the function uses `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`.

To fix the bug, the command used with `Popen` should match the expected command in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[2])
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
