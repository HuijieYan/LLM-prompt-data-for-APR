The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class has a bug in the way it extracts the version information. The `Popen` command is using the parameter `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version, but the expected output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'` which indicates that the correct parameter should be `['fish', '--version']`. 

Additionally, the `Popen` call should use the parameter `shell=True` to execute the command through the shell.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct `Popen` command to get the version information and should also include the `shell=True` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the `info` function will now use the correct command to get the version information and should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
