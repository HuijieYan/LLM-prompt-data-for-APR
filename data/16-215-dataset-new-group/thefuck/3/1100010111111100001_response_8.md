The buggy function is `info` in the file `fish.py`. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell using the `fish` command, but it is not parsing the output correctly, as shown by the failing test and error message.

The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock for the `Popen` class, where the `stdout.read` method returns the bytes `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`. It then asserts that the `shell.info()` call should return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. However, the actual return value is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, leading to the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to extract the version number.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly parse the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to extract the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

This corrected version correctly splits the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to extract the version number and returns it in the expected format.
