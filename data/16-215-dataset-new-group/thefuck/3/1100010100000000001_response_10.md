The potential error in the provided code is that it is not properly handling the subprocess call to get the version of the Fish shell. The bug appears to be that the function is not properly waiting for the subprocess to complete before retrieving the version, and it may also not be handling errors properly.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method to wait for the subprocess to complete and handle any errors that occur.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
    if proc.returncode != 0:
        return "Error: Unable to get Fish shell version"
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `communicate()` method to wait for the subprocess to complete and retrieve the standard output and standard error streams. We also check the return code of the subprocess and handle any errors by returning an error message if the return code is not 0.
