Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The Popen call might not be capturing the correct version number.
- The decoding of the stdout might not be working as expected.
- The formatting of the return string might be incorrect.

The cause of the bug using the failing test:
The test is expecting the version number to be extracted from the output of the 'fish --version' command, but the current implementation is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which might not provide the correct output format.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the Popen call to capture the version number using 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. Then, we need to properly decode the stdout and format the return string to match the expected output of the test.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected version of the buggy function should pass the failing test.
