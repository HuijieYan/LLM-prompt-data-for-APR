The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly retrieves the version of the fish shell. The test is failing because the expected version '3.5.9' is not matching with the actual version 'fish, version 3.5.9' returned by the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly parsing the output of the 'fish --version' command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly parse the version from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_str.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly parse the version from the output of the 'fish --version' command, and the failing test should pass.
