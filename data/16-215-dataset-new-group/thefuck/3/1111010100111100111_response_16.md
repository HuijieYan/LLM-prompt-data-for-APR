The bug is in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. It is failing to return the correct version of Fish shell. The `Popen` mock object is returning the version string with an additional "fish, version" prefix, which is causing the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the version string returned from the `Popen` command. This is leading to an incorrect version string being returned, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the version string returned from the `Popen` command and remove the "fish, version" prefix before returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove the prefix
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this correction, the `info` function should now properly parse the version string and return "Fish Shell 3.5.9", resolving the failing test and the issue reported on GitHub.
