The bug in the "info" function is causing an infinite recursive loop because it's using the incorrect command to get the Fish shell version. This is causing the failing test as it's not returning the expected version of the Fish shell.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to get the Fish shell version and return the correct version in the "info" function.

Here's the corrected version of the "info" function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly return the version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.

This fix also aligns with the GitHub issue description, stating that the fix is on its way and is related to the incorrect command used in the "info" function.
