The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, while the test is expecting the command `fish --version` to be called.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch with the expected version in the test.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command `fish --version` to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
