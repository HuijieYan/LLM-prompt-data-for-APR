The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, the failing test indicates that the version being returned is not in the expected format. The failing test is looking for the version string to be in the format `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the function is currently returning it as just `'3.5.9'`. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed in the Popen is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but the test is expecting the version string to be returned by `['fish', '--version']`. This mismatch is leading to the incorrect version format being extracted and returned.

To fix the bug, the command executed in the Popen needs to be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to align with the expectations of the test.

Additionally, the function needs to handle the version string extraction from the output of the Popen command to ensure it matches the expected format. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version of the Fish shell in the expected format, and the failing test should pass. This fix also aligns with the expectations of the GitHub issue related to the use of the `thefuck` plugin with Fish shell.
