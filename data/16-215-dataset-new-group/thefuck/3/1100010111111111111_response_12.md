The cause of the bug is that the function is using the wrong command to get the version of Fish shell, and it's not processing the output correctly. This results in a mismatch between the actual version and the expected version, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and process the output correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function now uses the correct command to get the Fish shell version and processes the output to extract the version number accurately.

This corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
