The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the stdout is not being read and decoded properly. This results in the version variable not being properly assigned the value of the FISH_VERSION environment variable.

To fix the bug, we need to read the output of the process using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object. This method returns a tuple of the stdout and stderr output of the process. We can then decode the stdout output to get the version value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly return the name and version of the Fish shell as expected.
