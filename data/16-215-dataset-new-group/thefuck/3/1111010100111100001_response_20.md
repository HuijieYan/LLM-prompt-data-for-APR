The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't properly extract the version number from the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command. As a result, the function is returning the entire output including the string "fish, version" instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly extract the version number from the command output and return it in the desired format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract just the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly extract the version number from the command output and return it in the format expected by the tests. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
