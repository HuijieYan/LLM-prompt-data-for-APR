## Analysis
The function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, utilizing the `Popen` function to execute a command in the Fish shell. The issue on GitHub indicates that the function `thefuck -v` hangs Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, and the cause of the bug is identified as a recursive loop triggered by `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()`.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the function `info` are:
1. The usage of `Popen` may not be handling the command execution properly.
2. The decoding of the output from the subprocess may be incorrect.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the function getting stuck in a recursive loop, as reported in the GitHub issue. This is likely due to the way the `Popen` function is used to execute the command in the Fish shell. Additionally, there may be an issue with how the output from the subprocess is being handled, leading to incorrect behavior and potential recursive loops.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the execution of the command in the Fish shell and correctly decode the output from the subprocess. This may involve making changes to the way the command is executed and how the output is read and decoded.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `shell=True` argument is added to the `Popen` function to properly execute the command in the Fish shell. Additionally, the `communicate()` method is used to read the output from the subprocess, and the decoding of the output is done after stripping any whitespace. These changes should help resolve the recursive loop issue reported in the GitHub bug.
