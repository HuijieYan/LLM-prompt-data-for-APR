The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file is that it's trying to extract the Fish shell version by running `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it should actually run `fish --version` to get the version info.

The cause of the bug is that the function is using the wrong command to get the version. It's running `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected function should use `fish --version` to retrieve the version information. Then it should extract the version number from the command output using `.split()[-1]` to select the last part of the output, which contains the version number.

With this correction, the function should now return the correct Fish Shell version and pass the failing test.
