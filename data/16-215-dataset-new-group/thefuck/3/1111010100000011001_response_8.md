The potential error locations in the buggy function are:

1. Lack of error handling for the subprocess Popen command.

The cause of the bug in this function is that the Popen command is not being awaited or communicated with properly, leading to incorrect or unexpected output.

To fix the bug, the subprocess Popen command should be awaited and proper error handling should be included to handle any exceptions that may occur during the command execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Error while retrieving fish shell version: {e}'
```
