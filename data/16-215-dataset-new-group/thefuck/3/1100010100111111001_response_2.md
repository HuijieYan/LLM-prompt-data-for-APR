The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly reading the version output from the `fish` shell command and formatting it as "Fish Shell {version}".

The expected behavior is that the function should execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, read the version output, and format it as "Fish Shell {version}".

To fix the bug, the function should correctly read the output of the `fish` command and format it as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the function uses `proc.communicate()[0]` to read the output of the `fish` command, and then formats it as "Fish Shell {version}" as expected.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
