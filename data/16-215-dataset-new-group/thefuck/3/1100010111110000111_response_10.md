The issue appears to be that the `info` function in the `shells/fish.py` file is not correctly retrieving the version of the Fish shell, leading to a failing test and an assertion error. 

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call in the `info` function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version, but the actual version output is `fish, version 3.5.9` which leads to an incorrect assertion in the test.

To fix this bug and pass the failing test, we should modify the `info` function to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the `fish --version` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

By modifying the command to `fish --version` and parsing the output to extract the version number, we can ensure that the correct version of the Fish shell is retrieved and the failing test is passed. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version retrieval.
