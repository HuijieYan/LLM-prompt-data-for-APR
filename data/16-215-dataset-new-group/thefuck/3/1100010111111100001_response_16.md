The bug in the provided function seems to be that it is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell and is instead returning "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just "3.5.9", leading to a failed test.

The `Popen` call is using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This is why the test is failing, as it expects the output to be "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

To fix the bug, the Popen call should use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the test should pass.
