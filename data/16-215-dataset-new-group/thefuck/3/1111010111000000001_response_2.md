The potential error location within the buggy function is the `Popen` call, which should pass `--version` as an argument instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. 

The bug is caused by the incorrect argument being passed to the `Popen` call in the `info` function. The failing test indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the buggy function is not returning the correct version number.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `Popen` call to pass `--version` as an argument to get the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(",")[1].strip())
```
With these changes, the `info` function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
