The potential error in the buggy function lies in the call to the Popen function. It seems that the call to 'fish' with the '-c' flag and 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command is causing a recursive loop due to the use of the 'thefuck -v' command. This is leading to the hang in the Fish Shell initialization, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can change the command being executed in the Popen call to avoid triggering the recursive loop. We can use a different command to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell without causing the hang during initialization.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the command 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION', we can retrieve the version of the Fish Shell without triggering the recursive loop and causing the hang during initialization with the 'thefuck -v' command. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
