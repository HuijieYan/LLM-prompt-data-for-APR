The buggy function has a few issues that need to be fixed:

1. The command used to get the Fish shell version is incorrect. It should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.
2. The assertion in the test case is failing because the expected version string is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', whereas the actual version string includes the prefix 'fish, version'.

To fix the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the buggy function should now be able to pass the failing test case and return the expected output:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
