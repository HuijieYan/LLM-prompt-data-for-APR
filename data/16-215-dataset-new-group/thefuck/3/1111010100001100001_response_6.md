The bug in the provided function is that it is not properly handling the output of the Popen process. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the Popen process.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the Popen process is properly executed and its output is captured correctly. We can do this by using the `communicate()` method of the Popen object, which will properly capture the output of the process.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()`, we ensure that the output of the process is properly captured and returned as the version of the Fish Shell.
