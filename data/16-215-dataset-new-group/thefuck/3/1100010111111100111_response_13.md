The buggy function is the 'info' function within the fish.py file, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function makes use of the Popen function from the subprocess module to execute a command that returns the shell version. The failing test is related to the 'info' function and it is asserting that the output of 'shell.info()' should be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

The potential error location within the 'info' function is the line that reads the output from the Popen command and formats it as 'Fish Shell {}'. The cause of the bug is that the output from the Popen command does not match the expected format, and this is resulting in the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the Popen command to execute 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION', as this is the command that provides the version number of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the 'info' function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version from the output
    version = version_output.split()[-1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using 'fish --version', the correct version number is extracted from the output and returned in the expected format. This fix should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
