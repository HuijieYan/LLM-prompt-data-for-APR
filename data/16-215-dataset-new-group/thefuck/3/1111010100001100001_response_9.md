The bug in the `info` function is that it is not properly handling the Popen process and its stdout. At the point of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, it returns a MagicMock object instead of the actual output from the command.

To fix this bug, we need to properly wait for the process to finish and then read the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the `proc.wait()` call, we ensure that the process finishes before reading its output. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct version of the Fish shell.
