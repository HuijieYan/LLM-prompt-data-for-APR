The bug in the function is that it is not waiting for the process to finish before trying to read the output. This can cause the function to return incorrect values or even raise errors.

We can fix this bug by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object, which waits for the process to finish and collects its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly wait for the `fish` process to finish and collect its output before returning the version information.
