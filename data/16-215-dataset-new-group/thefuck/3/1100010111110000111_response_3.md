## The buggy function

The `info` function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by calling the `fish` command with the `-c` option to retrieve the version. However, the function currently reads the version output incorrectly, causing it to return a wrongly formatted string.

## Potential error location

The line causing the issue is most likely:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
Here, the function is reading the version from `proc.stdout` but potentially not handling the output format correctly.

## Cause of the bug

The failing test indicates that the `shell.info()` call returns a string in the format "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of the expected "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This indicates that the `info` function reads the version output incorrectly, leading to a mismatch when compared to the expected version.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by correctly parsing and formatting the output of the `fish` command.

## The corrected version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command to fetch the version
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function fetches the version using the correct command and properly extracts the version number from the output, leading to a correctly formatted return value. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
