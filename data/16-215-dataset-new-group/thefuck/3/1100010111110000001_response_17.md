The buggy function `info` is designed to return the name and version of the fish shell. However, there are a few issues with the function that cause it to fail the test.

Firstly, the Popen command in the `info` function is invoking fish with the argument `-c` and the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test is setting the side effects for `stdout.read` to `[b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']`, which doesn't match the command being used in the Popen call.

Secondly, the format used to extract the version from the output of the Popen command is incorrect. As a result, it's causing the assertion error in the test.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen as well as the formatting of the version should be aligned with what the test is expecting.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The updated function passes the corrected version. Now, when the test calls `shell.info()`, it will return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected, and no assertion error will occur.
