## The buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and error message
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish shell in this case. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assert statement is failing because instead of returning the expected result of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error location in the `info` function is the way the version is being extracted from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the current method of extracting the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command is incorrect. It is taking the entire output, including the words "fish, version".

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, the version needs to be extracted correctly from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. This can be achieved by properly parsing the output to extract just the version number.

## The corrected version of the info function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)  # Return the correct version
```
