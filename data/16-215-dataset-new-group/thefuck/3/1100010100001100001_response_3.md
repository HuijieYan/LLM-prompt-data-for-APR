The issue with the provided code is that it is using a mock object for `proc` and `proc.stdout`. This is likely causing the function to return incorrect values and causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function is actually calling the Popen method and reading the stdout from the process. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method to read the output from the process and decode it to get the version of the fish shell. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct version of the shell.
