```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` call does not return the expected value. This is reflected in the error message where the difference in the expected and actual values of the `shell.info()` function is shown. The expected value is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual value is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This is due to the incorrect handling of the stdout from the Popen process.

To fix the bug, the correct way to read from the stdout of the Popen process is to use the `proc.stdout.readline()` method instead of `proc.stdout.read()`.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
