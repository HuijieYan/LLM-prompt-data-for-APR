## Analysis:
The `info` function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish Shell.

## Potential Errors:
1. The call to `proc.stdout.read()` may not read the data from the process output completely before decoding and stripping it.
2. The use of `DEVNULL` is not imported correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the output of the subprocess is not being read properly and there is an issue with the use of `DEVNULL`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `communicate()` method of the subprocess to ensure all output is read completely.
2. Import `DEVNULL` correctly or replace it with `subprocess.DEVNULL`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from ..utils import cache

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
