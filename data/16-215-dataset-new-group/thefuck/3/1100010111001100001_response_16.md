The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

The buggy function uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell, but the test code expects the command `fish --version` to be used.

To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test.
