### Strategy for fixing the bug
Based on the error message, it seems that the function is returning the entire output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of just the version number. Also, the decoding of the output may not be handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly parse the output of the command and extract the version number. Then we can use this version number to construct the correct return value.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected version of the function should properly parse the output of the command to extract the version number and use it to construct the correct return value. This should address the issue and make the function return the expected value based on the provided test case.
