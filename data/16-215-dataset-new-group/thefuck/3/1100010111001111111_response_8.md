The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file is caused by the incorrect command used to get the Fish Shell version. The `info` function tries to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the test is expecting to read the version from `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the command to get the Fish Shell version should be updated to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by `thefuck -v` with Oh-My-Fish plugin.
