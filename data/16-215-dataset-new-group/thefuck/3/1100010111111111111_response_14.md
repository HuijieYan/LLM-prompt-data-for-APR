The buggy function is `info` in `shells/fish.py`. The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it calls `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` subprocess, which causes an issue. When the failing test `test_info` in `tests/shells/test_fish.py` is executed, it fails with the error message: `AssertionError: assert 'Fish Shell f...version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

The issue is caused by the fact that the `info` function retrieves the version of Fish shell using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the output format is not as expected. This leads to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output.

To fix the bug, the version of Fish shell should be obtained using the `fish --version` command instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This will ensure that the output format matches the expected value.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.
