To fix the bug in the given function, we need to handle the subprocess call by capturing the output after it's completed. We can do this by using the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version uses the `communicate()` method to capture the output of the subprocess call and decode it to get the version of the Fish shell. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
