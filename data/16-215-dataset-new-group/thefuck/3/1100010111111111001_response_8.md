The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to read the FISH_VERSION environment variable using the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, but it is not capturing the correct output. This is evident from the failing test where the expected value is 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual value is '3.5.9'. This is also reflected in the runtime values where the proc.stdout.read output is a MagicMock instead of the expected string.

To fix this bug, the function should use the correct command to retrieve the fish version. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly retrieve the fish version using the '--version' command and return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
