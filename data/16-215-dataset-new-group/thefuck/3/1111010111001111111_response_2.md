To fix the bug in the `info` function, we need to update the command used to get the Fish Shell version and ensure it matches the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.

Cause of the bug:
The current implementation of the `info` function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish Shell version. However, the expected version string is not being captured as the command used does not match the expected output.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The function should use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish Shell version.
2. This change will align the command with the expected output and resolve the issue related to recursive loop.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the `info` function should be able to retrieve the correct Fish Shell version and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
