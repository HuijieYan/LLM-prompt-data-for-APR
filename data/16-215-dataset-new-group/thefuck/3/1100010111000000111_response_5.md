## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

Explanation:
The buggy function attempts to retrieve the Fish shell version by executing the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, which is incorrect. The failing test indicates that the expected version is '3.5.9', but the current implementation does not return the expected version.

The GitHub issue further clarifies that the 'thefuck -v' command triggers a recursive loop due to the incorrect implementation of Fish.info().

To fix the bug, the command to retrieve the Fish shell version should be changed to 'fish --version', and the version should be extracted from the output using the corrected implementation shown above. This will resolve the recursive loop and provide the correct version information.

The corrected version of the function is provided above, which should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
