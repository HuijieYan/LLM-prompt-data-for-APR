The potential error location within the buggy function is likely the `Popen` command, as the issue seems to be related to the command returning incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` command is not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version. This results in the test failing because the expected version doesn't match the actual version returned.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be updated to execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

In the corrected version, the command passed to `Popen` is updated to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the Fish Shell version. Then, the returned version is split using the comma and space delimiter, and only the version part is used to format the output string. This will fix the bug described and make the function return the correct version of the Fish Shell.
