Based on the provided information, the buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is failing to return the correct output. The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the `version` variable is not being constructed correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the issue seems to be related to the construction of the `version` variable. The `proc.stdout.read()` method returns the value `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which implies that the correct version number is being retrieved, but the processing of this value into the `version` variable is incorrect.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the processing of the `version` variable to extract only the version number from the output of `proc.stdout.read()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = output.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Extract the version number from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
