The buggy function `info` within the class `Fish` is trying to get the version of the Fish Shell through a subprocess. However, the call to `Popen` is incorrect, as it's trying to run `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `fish --version` in the test code. This leads to the failing test `test_info` in `test_fish.py` where the expected shell version does not match the actual version obtained from the `info` function.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call needs to be modified to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, and the decoding of the output may also need adjustments to correctly capture the version.

Additionally, the GitHub issue "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialization with Oh-My-Fish plugin" indicates that the bug leads to a recursive loop due to an incorrect call within the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The fix for the issue is on its way, but it involves the modification of the `info` function.

A corrected version of the `info` function is provided below:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

With the above correction, the `info` function now correctly calls `fish --version`, captures the output, and extracts the version number, resolving the failing test and the GitHub issue.
