The bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class lies in the way the version of the Fish shell is being fetched. Currently, the version is fetched using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but in the failing test, the expected version is `3.5.9`, and the actual version is fetched as `fish, version 3.5.9`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command used to fetch the Fish shell version. It should be updated to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the `Popen` call.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This change will ensure that the correct version of the Fish shell is fetched and returned by the `info` method, fixing the bug and making the test pass.
