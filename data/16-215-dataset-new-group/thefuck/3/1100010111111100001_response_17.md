The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish Shell version. It is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` but it should be using `fish --version` to retrieve the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to `fish --version` and then modify the `info` function to parse the version number from the command output correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_str.split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
