## The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(",")[1].strip())
```
In the original code, the `info` function is attempting to format the version information directly into a string. This is causing the error in the test because the version is not extracted correctly and includes unwanted characters. 
I modified the `info` function to split the version string at the comma and take the second part. This should correctly extract the version number and resolve the issue reported.
