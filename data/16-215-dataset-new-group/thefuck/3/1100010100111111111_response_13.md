The buggy function `info` from the `fish.py` file in the `thefuck` repository is failing to return the expected version of the Fish Shell. The `info` function is supposed to retrieve the version of the current shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then formatting the output as 'Fish Shell <version>'. However, the test is failing because the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. It is expected to receive the output 'fish, version 3.5.9' but instead is receiving '3.5.9', which is causing the mismatch.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly parse the output of the command and then format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Modify the version string to only include the version number
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function will correctly parse the output of the `fish --version` command and format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'. This should fix the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue raised on GitHub regarding the recursive loop caused by the incorrect output.
