The bug in the `info` function is caused by the fact that the string "fish, version" is included in the output, and the function tries to format this string as if the only version number is present. This results in the comparison failure in the test. 

To fix this bug, the `info` function should be modified to correctly extract only the version number from the output of the subprocess. The extracted version number should then be formatted into the desired string format before being returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Extract version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will correctly extract the version number from the output of the subprocess and format it into the desired string format. This should resolve the comparison failure in the test.
