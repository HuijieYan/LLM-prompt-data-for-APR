## The analysis of the buggy function and the failing test
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish Shell. The function uses the `Popen` module to execute a command and retrieve the version, but it currently uses the incorrect command to get the version.

The failing test `test_info` sets up a mock for `Popen` to return a specific version string, and then asserts that the `info` function returns the correct version.

The expected input values for the failing test are the mock `Popen` object and the version string 'fish, version 3.5.9', and the expected output value is the formatted version string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

The GitHub issue mentions that the `info` function in the Fish shell is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used, and a fix is being worked on.

## Error locations
- The command passed to `Popen` in the `info` function is incorrect.
- The function currently does not handle the command output properly.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish Shell version. This results in incorrect output, which causes a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version should be used, and the function should handle the command output properly to extract the version string.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version, the command `['fish', '--version']` is used to retrieve the Fish Shell version, and the output is properly handled to extract the version string. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
