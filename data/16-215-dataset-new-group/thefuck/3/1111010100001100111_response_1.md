### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is being used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This happens because the `info()` function in the `Fish` class of the `fish.py` file is trying to retrieve the Fish Shell version by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This causes the `thefuck` plugin to be triggered again, creating a recursive loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to find an alternative way to retrieve the Fish Shell version that does not trigger the `thefuck` plugin. One way to do this is by reading the version directly from a configuration file or environment variable, rather than executing a command.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function in the `Fish` class:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION', 'unknown')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are directly reading the value of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable to retrieve the Fish Shell version, which avoids triggering the `thefuck` plugin.
