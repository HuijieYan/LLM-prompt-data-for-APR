## Analysis
The function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` class from the `subprocess` module to execute a command to retrieve the Fish shell version. However, there are potential error locations within the code:
1. The `Popen` class is used without importing it directly from the `subprocess` module. 
2. The `stdout.read()` method is called directly on `proc`, which may cause issues with the return value.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not importing the `Popen` class directly from the `subprocess` module, and by not handling the return value of `stdout.read()` properly.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Import the `Popen` class directly from the `subprocess` module.
2. Use the `communicate()` method to properly read the output of the process.

## The corrected function
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
    from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
