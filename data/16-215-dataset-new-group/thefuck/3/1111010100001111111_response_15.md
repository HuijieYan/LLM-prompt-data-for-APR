The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` as the command to retrieve the Fish shell version. This command might not return the expected result, which is causing the function to return an incorrect version.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not returning the expected version of the Fish shell, leading to the incorrect version being returned by the `info` function. This bug is causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, triggering a recursive loop.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use a different approach to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, such as directly reading a version file or using a command that reliably provides the version information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell has been changed to `fish -v`, which reliably provides the version information. This change should resolve the issue and provide the correct version of the Fish shell.
