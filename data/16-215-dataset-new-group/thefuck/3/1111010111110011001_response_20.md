The buggy function is the `info` function within the `Fish` class. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command in the fish shell. 

The error in the function is that it is trying to retrieve the version of the fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but in the failing test, the mocked return value for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read` is set to `[b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']`. This means the function is expecting the output to be in the format of `fish, version 3.5.9`, but the function is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version, leading to a format mismatch.

To fix the bug, the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` can be replaced with `fish --version` to ensure that the output matches the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```
