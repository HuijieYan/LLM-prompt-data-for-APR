The issue with the `info` function in the `shells/fish.py` file is that it is trying to get the Fish version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of using `fish --version`. This causes the function to return an incorrect version and also triggers a recursive loop in certain scenarios, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be modified to use the correct command `fish --version` to get the version of Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this corrected function, it should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and also resolve the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub post.

This revised function now uses the correct command to get the version of Fish shell and replaces the unnecessary text 'fish, version ' from the output to obtain the version number only.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
