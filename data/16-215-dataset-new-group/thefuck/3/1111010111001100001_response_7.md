The bug in the `info` function is that instead of using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version, it is using `fish --version` which results in the incorrect value being fetched.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
