Fixed code:

# The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell ' + version.split(' ')[2]
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function failed to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell due to an incorrect command in the Popen call. The incorrect command used 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of the correct command '--version'. This caused the failing test to return an incorrect version, resulting in the test failure.

The fix involved changing the command in the Popen call to ['fish', '--version'] to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Additionally, the return statement was modified to properly format the version string by splitting the output of the command and retrieving the correct version value, addressing the failure of the test.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
