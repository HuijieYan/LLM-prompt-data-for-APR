The cause of the bug is that when the info() function is called, it triggers a recursive loop because it uses the 'thefuck -v' command, which is the same trigger that caused it to be called in the first place. This leads to a hang in Fish Shell initialization when the Oh-My-Fish plugin is used.

To fix the bug, we can modify the info() function to simply return the name of the shell without using any commands that might trigger a recursive loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    return 'Fish Shell'
```

By returning a simple string without triggering any commands, we can prevent the recursive loop and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
