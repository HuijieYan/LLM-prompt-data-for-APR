The bug in the provided function is using `proc.stdout.read()` to read the output of the Popen process. The issue is that `proc.stdout.read()` is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the Popen process.

To fix this bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object to get the output and error of the process. This method will also wait for the process to terminate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
