The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the fish version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the actual version number, resulting in the wrong output in the test.

To fix this bug, the correct command to retrieve the fish version should be `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now return the correct version number and pass the failing test.
