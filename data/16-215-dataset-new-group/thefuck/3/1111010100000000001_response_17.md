## Explanation
The bug in the `info` function is caused by not waiting for the process to finish before reading its output. `Popen` starts the process but the function continues to execute before the process has completed, leading to incorrect or incomplete output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to wait for the process to finish and read its output.

## The corrected version
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
