The issue with the current implementation of the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the fish Shell, but a call to `fish --version` is expected in the test. This causes inconsistency and fails the test.

To fix this issue, the `info` function should be modified to execute the `fish --version` command and capture the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this corrected version, the test should pass successfully and resolve the issue reported on the GitHub.
