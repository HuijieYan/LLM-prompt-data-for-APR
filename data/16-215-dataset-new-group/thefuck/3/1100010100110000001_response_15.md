Based on the provided buggy function and the corresponding error message, it appears that the issue is with the `info()` function in the `fish.py` file. The error message indicates that the function is returning an unexpected string due to the version number being prefixed with "fish, version" instead of just the version number itself.

The potential error in the buggy function is with how the version is extracted from the output of the Popen process and how it is formatted.

The cause of the bug is that the version is extracted as "fish, version 3.5.9" rather than just "3.5.9", resulting in a string mismatch when comparing it to the expected value.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly extract the version number from the output and format it without the unnecessary prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This new version of the function extracts only the version number from the output of the Popen process and formats it correctly, which should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
