##  Fixing the bug

### Analysis:
The error message states that the output of the `info` function contains the string "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of the expected "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This suggests that the parsing of the version information is incorrect. 

The GitHub issue also mentions that the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to this buggy function.

### Identified potential error locations:
The potential error lies in the parsing of the version obtained from the `fish -c` command.

### Cause of the bug:
The `info` function is directly reading the output of the `fish -c` command without considering the format of the output, which causes it to include unnecessary information in the version string.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the `info` function to properly parse and format the version information obtained from the `fish -c` command. This can be achieved by ensuring that only the version string is extracted and returned.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(",")[1].strip()  # Extracting and formatting version
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the `info` function will properly extract the version information from the output of the `fish -c` command and format it as "Fish Shell <version>". This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
