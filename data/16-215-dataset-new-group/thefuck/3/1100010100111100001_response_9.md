The bug in the provided function is causing the error because the returned value includes the string "fish, version" as part of the version number, which is not intended.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`; it is returning the entire output including the prefix "fish, version" which is not needed.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the command and return it in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(", version ")[1]  # extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version number without including the unnecessary prefix.
