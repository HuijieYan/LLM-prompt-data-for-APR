The buggy function `info` uses `Popen` to run a command for getting the version of the current shell. The output of the command is then read and decoded to get the version, which is used to construct the return value. However, the command being run is incorrect, and the cause of the bug is that the command being run to get the shell version is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version'. This is causing the test to fail because the expected version of the shell is not being retrieved.

To fix the bug, the command being run using Popen needs to be changed from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this fix, the `info` function will correctly run the command to get the version of the shell, and the test will pass as expected.
