The potential error in the buggy function lies in the `Popen` call, where the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is used to get the Fish shell version. However, the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual versions and causing the test to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in `shells/fish.py` is not retrieving the Fish shell version in the expected format, causing a mismatch in the test.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call in the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command `fish --version` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

This corrected version uses the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and properly parses the version string to return the expected result. With this correction, the failing test should pass and the issue reported in GitHub should be resolved.
