## The source code of the corrected function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # The version string includes the word "fish, version", which needs to be removed
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation

The bug is caused by the fact that the version string returned by the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` includes the text "fish, version" in addition to the actual version number. This causes the assertion to fail, as the expected and actual version strings do not match.

The corrected version of the function removes the "fish, version" portion from the version string before returning it in the format 'Fish Shell {version}'.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

The bug can be fixed by modifying the version string to remove the unwanted text "fish, version" before returning it.

The corrected version of the function above demonstrates this fix by using the `replace()` method to remove the unwanted text.

After making this modification, the function will return the expected version string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', resolving the failing test and the issue in GitHub.
