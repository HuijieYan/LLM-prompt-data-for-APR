## Analysis
The buggy function attempts to get the version of the Fish Shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, it seems to be causing a recursive loop issue in certain scenarios, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The issue seems to be related to the use of the `-v` flag in the plugin, triggering a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.

## Identifying potential error locations
1. The use of the `-v` flag may be causing an unexpected behavior.
2. The function may not be properly handling the output of the command executed using Popen.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug seems to be related to the interaction between the use of the `-v` flag and the behavior of the `Fish.info()` function. It appears that the function is not returning the version of Fish Shell as expected, causing a recursive loop in certain scenarios. This could be due to incorrect handling of the command output or the use of the `-v` flag triggering unexpected behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the command output and ensure that it does not cause a recursive loop when used with the `-v` flag. Additionally, the use of the `-v` flag should be investigated to understand its impact on the function's behavior and address any unexpected consequences.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command to retrieve the Fish Shell version has been modified to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This should avoid any unexpected behavior caused by the use of the `-v` flag and ensure that the function returns the correct version of Fish Shell.
