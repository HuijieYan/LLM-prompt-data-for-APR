The issue with the buggy function is that it is not capturing the correct output from the Popen process and is not formatting the version string correctly. 

The `Popen` function is executed to run the command `'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capture the output, which is then decoded and stripped to get the version. However, the expected version string is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, whereas the current implementation only captures the version number `'3.5.9'`.

To fix this bug, we need to change the command to include the desired format of the version string and capture the correct output from the Popen process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo "fish, version $FISH_VERSION"'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

With this correction, the function captures the correct version string and returns it as expected.
