The buggy function `info` is not correctly retrieving the version of the Fish Shell. The error message indicates that the function is returning a string with the prefix "fish, version", causing the assertion to fail. The GitHub issue also suggests that calling `thefuck -v` is causing a recursive loop due to the buggy behavior of `Fish.info()`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` function to properly capture the version of the Fish Shell without the unnecessary prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell ' + version
```

In this corrected version, the `split(', ')[1]` splits the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the ', ' as the delimiter and takes the second part, which is the version number. This prevents the unnecessary prefix from being included in the returned string.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
