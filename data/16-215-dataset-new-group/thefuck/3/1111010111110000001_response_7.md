The problem with the `info` function is that it is expecting the version output from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to contain only the version number, but the actual output includes `fish, version` as well. Additionally, the test is calling the `Popen` with the wrong arguments, as it should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. To fix this bug, the function should be modified to parse the version number properly and update the test to check for the correct command arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the function correctly reads the version from the `fish` command output and strips the unnecessary prefix. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
