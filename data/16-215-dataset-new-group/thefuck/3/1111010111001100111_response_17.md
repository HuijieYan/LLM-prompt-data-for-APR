## The corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the original function `info` is caused by the incorrect command used to get the Fish shell version. The function was using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which resulted in incorrect output and failing test cases. 

The corrected version of the function uses the proper command `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell.

The failing test case is addressed by changing the command to get the Fish shell version to `fish --version` in the corrected function. This change resolves the recursive loop issue triggered by the original function.
