The bug in the `info` function is that it's returning the string "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell 3.5.9", which is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

The cause of this bug is that the `info` function is not parsing the output of the `Popen` command correctly. It is returning the entire output string instead of extracting and formatting just the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly extract and format the version number from the output of the `Popen` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the `info` function should correctly extract the version number and format it as "Fish Shell x.x.x", allowing the failing test to pass.
