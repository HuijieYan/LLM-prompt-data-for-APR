The buggy function is the `info` method in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. The purpose of the `info` method is to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell. However, the failing test indicates that the expected output is different from the actual output.

### Analysis:
The failing test `test_info` simulates a call to the `info` method. It sets up a mock `Popen` object to return a specific value when `stdout.read` is invoked. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is different due to the command being used in the `info` method.

The runtime values and types of variables inside the `info` function indicate that the value of `version` is '3.5.9'. However, the expected value for `version` is 'fish, version 3.5.9', which indicates that the command being executed is not retrieving the correct version string from the Fish shell.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version. The call to `Popen` with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` does not return the version string in the expected format.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the command executed in the `info` method needs to be updated to correctly retrieve the version string in the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version, the `info` method is updated to execute the `fish --version` command to retrieve the correct version string. Additionally, the version string is split to extract only the version number, ensuring that the output matches the expected format.
