Firstly, the buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the fish shell by executing a command. The error message shows that the returned string from the command includes the word 'fish, version' which is not expected. The expected output should only be the version number. 

To fix this bug, the `info` function needs to be modified to parse the output of the Popen call to extract only the version number and then format it appropriately.

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
