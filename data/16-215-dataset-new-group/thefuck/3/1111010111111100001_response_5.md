The bug in the `info` function is caused by the fact that the command used to extract the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to the test failing.

To fix this bug, the command used to extract the version of the Fish shell should be changed to `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This will retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell and ensure that the test passes.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
