The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is in the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is incorrect and should be replaced with `['fish', '--version']`. This is the cause of the failing test. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
