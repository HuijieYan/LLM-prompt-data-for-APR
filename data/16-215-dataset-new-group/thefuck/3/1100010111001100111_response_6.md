The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project is failing the test because it is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the incorrect command. The `Popen` call in the `info` function is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the Fish shell version, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `['fish', '--version']`.

To fix the bug, the command in the `Popen` call needs to be modified to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. Additionally, this fix should address the recursive loop issue reported in the GitHub issue.
