## The cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current implementation uses `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version, but it should be using `fish --version`. This leads to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output, causing the failing test.

## Fix strategy

The fix strategy involves updating the command to retrieve the Fish shell version from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version`. This will ensure that the correct version is obtained and the test passes.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
