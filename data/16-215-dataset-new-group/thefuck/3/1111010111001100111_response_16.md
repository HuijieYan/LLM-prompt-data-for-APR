The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is using the incorrect command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` call is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is not the correct command to retrieve the shell version, causing the function to return an incorrect value.

The correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version is `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `Popen` call to use the correct command.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the `Popen` call to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, the function should now return the correct version and pass the failing test. This should also address the issue reported on GitHub.
