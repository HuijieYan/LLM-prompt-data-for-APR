## Analysis:
The buggy function 'info' within the 'Fish' class is using the Popen function to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell. However, this causes a recursive loop when the 'thefuck -v' command is used, which triggers the 'info' function and causes the shell initialization to hang.

## Identified Errors:
1. The usage of Popen without handling potential recursive calls.
2. The function does not check if it is being called recursively.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the lack of handling recursive calls when using the Popen function to get the Fish shell version. This causes a recursive loop when executing the 'thefuck -v' command.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a mechanism to prevent recursive calls in the 'info' function. This can be achieved by checking if the function is being called recursively and handle it appropriately to prevent the hang during shell initialization.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    _is_info_call = False  # Add a flag to track recursive call

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if self._is_info_call:  # Check recursive call
            return 'Fish Shell'
        else:
            self._is_info_call = True
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            self._is_info_call = False  # Reset the flag
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, a flag '_is_info_call' is added to track recursive calls. The function checks if it is already being called recursively and returns a default value to prevent the hang. This will resolve the recursive loop issue when the 'thefuck -v' command is used.
