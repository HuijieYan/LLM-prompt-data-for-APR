The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version and is not formatting the version correctly. This is causing the failing test, which expects the version to be in a specific format.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not using the correct command to get the Fish shell version and is not stripping the output to get the version number only.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and then format the version number correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and the version number will be formatted correctly. This should resolve the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
