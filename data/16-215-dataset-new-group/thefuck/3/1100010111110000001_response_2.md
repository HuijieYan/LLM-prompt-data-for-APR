The problem with the `info` function in `fish.py` is that it is trying to obtain the version information of the Fish Shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. However, it should be executing the command `fish --version` to obtain the correct version information.

#### Steps to fix the bug:
1. Update the command executed with `Popen` to `fish --version`.
2. Also, specify the shell environment when executing the command.

### Corrected version of the function `info`:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the function `info`, the test case provided should pass without any assertion errors, and the correct version information of Fish Shell will be obtained.
