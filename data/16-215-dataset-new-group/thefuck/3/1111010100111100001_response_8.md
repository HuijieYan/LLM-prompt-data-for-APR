The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect parsing of the shell version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The function is returning the entire output string, including the "fish, version" prefix, instead of just the version number.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly parse the version number from the command output and format it as 'Fish Shell {version}'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove the prefix
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
