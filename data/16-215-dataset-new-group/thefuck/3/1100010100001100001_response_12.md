### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function is that it's not correctly reading the output of the `Popen` subprocess and converting it to the version of the Fish shell. The `proc.stdout.read()` is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the command.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly read the output of the subprocess.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
