The buggy function has a couple of potential error locations:
1. The Popen command is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`, which could result in the wrong output being captured.
2. The method of reading the output from the Popen command may not be reliable, as it uses `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, which might not capture the output correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen command is capturing the wrong output and the reading method of the output may not be capturing it correctly. This leads to the incorrect version being returned from the function.

To fix the bug, we should change the Popen command to `['fish', '--version']` to capture the correct version, and use the communicate method to capture the output more reliably.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].strip().decode('utf-8')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now capture the correct version from the Popen command and return the expected output.
