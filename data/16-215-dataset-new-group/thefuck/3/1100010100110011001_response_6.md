## The fixed version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug in the function occurs because the original implementation does not correctly extract the version number from the output of the command. This causes the comparison with the expected value to fail.

In the failing test error message, it can be seen that the expected version number is '3.5.9', but the function extracts 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead.

To fix the bug, an additional step is needed to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

The fixed version of the function splits the output by ', ' and takes the second part as the version number. This corrected implementation should resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.

The fixed version of the function correctly extracts the version number, so it should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
