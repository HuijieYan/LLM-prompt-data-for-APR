The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the fish version from the shell. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to retrieve the fish version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of the correct command `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly retrieve the fish version.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
