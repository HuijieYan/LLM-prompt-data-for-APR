## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

The bug in the original function was causing a recursive loop due to the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' being used to get the version of the Fish shell. The fix involves changing the command to 'fish --version' which provides the correct version without triggering a recursive loop.

With this fix, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell without causing any recursive loops. This will resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.
