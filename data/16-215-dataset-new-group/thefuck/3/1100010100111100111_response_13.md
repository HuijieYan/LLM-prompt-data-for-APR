## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the way the `info` function retrieves the version of the Fish shell. It is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which is not providing the expected output. The error message also shows that the output is not being formatted correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved and then format the output string accordingly. We also need to ensure that the correct version is parsed from the output.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are using `fish --version` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. We then parse the output to extract the version number, and format the output string as 'Fish Shell x.x.x'.

This corrected version should address the issue with retrieving the correct version and formatting the output string accordingly.
