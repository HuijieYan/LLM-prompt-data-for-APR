The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish. This can result in the function hanging when trying to read the output from the process.

To fix the bug, we can use the `proc.communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and then read its output.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will wait for the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to finish and retrieve the output before returning the version of the Fish shell. The fix addresses the hanging issue reported in the GitHub issue.
