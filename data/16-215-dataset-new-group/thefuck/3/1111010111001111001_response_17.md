The bug in the `info` function is that the `Popen` call is using the wrong command and not capturing the correct version of the Fish shell.

To fix this bug, the `Popen` call should be updated to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
