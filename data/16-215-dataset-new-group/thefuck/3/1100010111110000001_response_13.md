The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`, resulting in incorrect output format that does not match the expected format in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to correctly fetch the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if ',' in version:
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the test should now pass as the format of the output string will match the expected format in the test function.
