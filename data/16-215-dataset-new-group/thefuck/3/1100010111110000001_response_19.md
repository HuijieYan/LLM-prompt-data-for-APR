The given buggy function `info` is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, specifically the Fish shell. It is using the `Popen` method to execute a command and retrieve the version.

The test function `test_info` checks if the correct version of the Fish shell is returned by the `info` function. The error message indicates that the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` does not match the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

The potential error location is the line where the version is extracted from the command output:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```

The bug is caused by the incorrect command being used in the `Popen` call, as well as the incorrect parsing of the version from the command output.

To fix the bug, the command needs to be changed to `['fish', '--version']`, and the parsing of the version should be adjusted to extract only the version number from the output and then format it according to the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
