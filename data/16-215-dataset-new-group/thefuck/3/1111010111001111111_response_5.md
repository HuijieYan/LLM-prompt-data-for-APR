The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to retrieve the Fish Shell version, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version`. This results in the version value being incorrect, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function will use the correct command to retrieve the Fish Shell version, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
