The bug in the `info` function is that it is calling the `fish` command with the argument `-c` and `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `--version`. This causes the version output to be incorrect, leading to the failing test. The error message clearly indicates that the expected version and the actual version are not matching.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to call the `fish` command with the `--version` argument instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```

With this corrected version, the test should pass as it's now calling the `fish` command with the correct `--version` argument, resulting in the expected version output.
