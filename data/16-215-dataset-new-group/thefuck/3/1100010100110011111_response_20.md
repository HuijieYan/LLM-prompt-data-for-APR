The bug in the provided function is causing the assertion error in the failing test. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is not parsing the version correctly, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The cause of the bug is that the version information obtained from the Popen command is not extracted correctly due to the incorrect parsing of the output.

To fix this bug, the version information needs to be extracted correctly from the output of the Popen command. The output 'fish, version 3.5.9' needs to be parsed to extract the version number '3.5.9'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command 'fish -v' is used to get the version information. Then, the output is parsed correctly to extract the version number.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It resolves the issue posted in GitHub by correctly extracting the version information from the output.
