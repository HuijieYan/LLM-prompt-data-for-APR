The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The command used within Popen might be incorrect, as the test expects Popen.call_args[0][0] to be ['fish', '--version'], but the current implementation is using ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'].
2. The decoding of the output from proc.stdout.read() might be causing issues.

The cause of the bug is that the info function is not obtaining the Fish shell version correctly, leading to a recursive loop when using the thefuck -v command, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the command used with Popen needs to be corrected to ['fish', '--version'] to match the expectation of the test. Additionally, the decoding of the output from proc.stdout.read() should be handled more robustly to prevent any potential issues.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

This corrected version should address the issues mentioned and pass the failing test case.
