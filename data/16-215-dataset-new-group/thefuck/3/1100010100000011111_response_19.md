The bug in the provided function is caused by using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to read the output of the Popen subprocess. This can lead to the function hanging in certain situations, such as when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the Popen object, which reads the entire output at once and avoids the potential for hanging.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    out, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
