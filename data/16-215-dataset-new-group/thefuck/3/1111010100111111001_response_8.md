The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly extracting the version of the Fish shell from the output of the Popen command.

The error message from the failing test indicates that it expected the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but received 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This indicates that the version string is not being extracted properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the output of the Popen command correctly, leading to an incorrect version string.

To fix the bug, the function should properly process the output of the Popen command to extract the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the correct function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to retrieve the output and then decode it to extract the version string. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct version string.
