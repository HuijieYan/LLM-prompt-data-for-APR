The bug in the provided function is that the version string obtained from the Popen process contains additional text "fish, version" which needs to be removed before formatting the output.

The cause of the bug is that the string obtained from the Popen process includes the text "fish, version" in addition to the actual version number, causing the formatting of the output to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to extract only the version number from the obtained string before formatting it to the desired output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_str = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_str.replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
