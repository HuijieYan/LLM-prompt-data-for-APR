The issue in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This causes the test to fail because it checks for the version using the correct command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
