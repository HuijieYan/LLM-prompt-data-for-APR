The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the `Popen` object properly and is not waiting for the process to finish before reading the output. This can result in reading an empty output or incomplete output.

To fix the bug, we need to wait for the process to finish before reading its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from subprocess import run, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        result = run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, text=True, check=True)
        version = result.stdout.strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this fixed version, we replaced `Popen` with `run` to make use of the subprocess module's improved interface for running external commands. We also added the `text=True` parameter to ensure that the output is decoded as text, and the `check=True` parameter to raise an error if the command fails. This allows the function to properly wait for the process to finish and retrieve the complete output.
