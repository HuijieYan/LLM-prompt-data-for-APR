The issue in the `info` function is that it is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the correct command is `fish --version`. This is causing the test to fail and is also mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
