The issue is caused by the fact that the `info` method of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file is not properly extracting the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This is evident from the failing test, where the expected version is '3.5.9' but the actual version extracted from the output is 'fish, version 3.5.9' due to the incorrect parsing of the output.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` method does not properly handle the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and simply appends it to the 'Fish Shell' string without extracting the version number alone.

To fix the bug, the `info` method should be modified to properly parse the output of the command and extract the version number, then format it alongside the 'Fish Shell' string.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` method:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version number from the output
    version_number = version.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

With this correction, the `info` method will properly extract the version number from the output of the command and return it in the correct format, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
