## Analysis
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a subprocess with the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the method for reading the output of the subprocess and formatting the result is causing the test to fail. The failing test attempts to verify that the result of `shell.info()` is equal to 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but due to the incorrect subprocess input and output handling in the `info` function, the test fails.

The GitHub issue mentions that the `info` method is causing a recursive loop which affects the initialization of the Fish shell when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Subprocess command correctness
2. Read and decode of subprocess output
3. Formatting of the version string
4. Test condition

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `info` function, which fails to retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell and format it properly. This discrepancy in the `info` function leads to a failing test where the expected version of the Fish shell does not match the actual version, leading to the assertion error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
2. Properly read and decode the output of the subprocess.
3. Format the version string with the correct version information.
4. Adjust the failing test condition to accommodate the correct format of the version string.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', ')[-1]  # Extract the version number from the output
        version = version.replace('version ', '')  # Remove the text 'version' from the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `info` function retrieves the version using the correct command `['fish', '--version']`, properly reads and decodes the output, and formats the version string as 'Fish Shell <version>'. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
