## The cause of the bug
The bug in the `info` function of the fish.py file is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version output from the Fish shell. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` method is not correctly parsing the version information, which results in the mismatch of the expected and actual output.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the parsing of the version information to obtain the correct version from the output of the Fish shell. We can use regular expressions or string manipulation to extract the version number without any additional text.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', version_output).group()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
