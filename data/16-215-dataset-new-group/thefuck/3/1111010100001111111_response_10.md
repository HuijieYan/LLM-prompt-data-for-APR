The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is not returning the expected version string in the correct format. The function is supposed to return the version of the current shell in the format 'Fish Shell X.X.X', but it is currently only returning 'X.X.X'.

The cause of the bug is that the format 'Fish Shell X.X.X' is not being applied to the version string before returning.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the return statement to include the 'Fish Shell' prefix before the version string.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
