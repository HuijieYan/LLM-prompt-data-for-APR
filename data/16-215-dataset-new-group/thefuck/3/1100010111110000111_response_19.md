The bug in the `info` function is caused by the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The error message indicates that the output of this command includes the string "fish, version" which is not expected.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function does not correctly parse the version string returned from the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. This results in the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to properly parse the version string and return it in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In this corrected version, we use the command `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell. Then we split the output string and extract the last element, which is the version number.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue in GitHub.
