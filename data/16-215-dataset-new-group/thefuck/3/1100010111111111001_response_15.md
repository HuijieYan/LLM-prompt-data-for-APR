The bug in the provided function `info` is caused by the incorrect call to the `fish` command to get the version, as well as reading the incorrect output from the process. The test is failing because the expected version of the Fish shell is not being obtained correctly from the process output.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to call the `fish --version` command instead of trying to read the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable. Additionally, the logic for reading the version output from the process needs to be adjusted to correctly extract the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', version ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should correctly obtain the version of the Fish shell from the command output and return the expected value.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass and the output of the `info` function will correctly match the expected value.
