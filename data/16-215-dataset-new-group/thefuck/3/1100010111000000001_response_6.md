The issue in the `info` function arises from the fact that it is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but the test is expecting the command `fish --version` to be used. This is causing the function to return a different format of the version number than what the test is expecting, leading to a failing test.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the command `fish --version` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1].replace('v', ''))
```

This change should ensure that the function returns the expected version format ('3.5.9' instead of 'fish, version 3.5.9') and passes the failing test.
