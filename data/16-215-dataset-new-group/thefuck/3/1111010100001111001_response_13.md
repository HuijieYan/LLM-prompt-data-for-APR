The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command in the fish shell. However, the function is not correctly capturing the output and formatting it. The `proc.stdout.read()` call is not returning the desired output.

The cause of the bug is that the call to `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not handling the output of the command correctly.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use the `communicate()` function of the `Popen` object to capture the output of the command. This will ensure that the function correctly captures the output of the shell command and returns the expected result.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
