## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The buggy function was not executing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version. The incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` was being used instead of `fish --version`. This caused the test to fail as it was expecting the incorrect output. By changing the command to `fish --version`, the correct version of the Fish shell is obtained, and the test will pass.

The corrected version of the buggy function uses the command `fish --version` to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This will produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
