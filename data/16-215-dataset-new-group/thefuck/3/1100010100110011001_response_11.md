The cause of the bug is that the function is reading the output of the command including the "fish, version" string, which is not expected. This causes the assertion error when comparing the expected version with the output of the function.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the command used in Popen to retrieve only the version number, without the "fish, version" string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
