The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it has a bug where it reads the version of the shell in an incorrect way.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) may not provide the expected output format.
2. The way the output of the process is read and decoded may be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell is incorrect, and the way the output of the process is read and decoded is not capturing the correct version information.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the fish shell should be changed to '`fish --version`' to get the correct version of the shell. Additionally, the way the output of the process is read and decoded should be modified to capture the correct version information.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This corrected version of the `info` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
