The issue here is that the `info` function is returning only the version number of the Fish shell, whereas the test case expects the entire string "Fish Shell [version]". 

The cause of the bug is that the function `info` is only returning the version number, while the test case expects the entire string "Fish Shell [version]".

To fix the bug, we need to update the `info` function to return the entire string including "Fish Shell".

The corrected version of the function should be:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
