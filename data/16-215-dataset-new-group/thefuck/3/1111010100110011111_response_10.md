The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is incorrectly parsing the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is returning `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should also resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
