The potential error in the buggy function is the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` in the Popen call.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not retrieving the shell version correctly, leading to the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the Popen call to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to correctly retrieve the shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should be able to retrieve the shell version correctly and pass the failing test. This fix also resolves the issue raised on GitHub about the recursive loop caused by using `thefuck -v` with Fish Shell.
