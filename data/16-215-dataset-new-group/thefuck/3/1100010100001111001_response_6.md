The issue with the buggy function is that it is not capturing the correct output from the 'fish' command to get the version. The version should be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the function is only capturing '3.5.9'.

The cause of the bug is that the function is only capturing the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command, which only returns the version number, without the prefix 'fish, version'.

To fix this bug, we should modify the command to include the desired prefix 'fish, version' before the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo "fish, version $FISH_VERSION"'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly capture the output of the 'fish' command and include the desired prefix 'fish, version'.
