The issue in the provided code is that the function is not correctly retrieving the version of the Fish shell. It is expected that the version string should include the text "fish, version" before the actual version number.

The cause of the bug is that the function is only capturing the version number from the shell command output, but it is missing the text "fish, version" which is expected in the result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to include the "fish, version" text in the returned version string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

With this change, the function now correctly captures the version of the Fish shell including the expected "fish, version" text.
