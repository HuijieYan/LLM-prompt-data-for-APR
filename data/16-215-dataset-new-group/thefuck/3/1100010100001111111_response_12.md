The issue with the buggy function `info` is that it is not properly capturing the version of the Fish shell. This is causing a recursive loop and hanging the initialization process, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not capturing the correct version of the Fish shell, which leads to a recursive loop and the hang during initialization.

To fix the bug, the function should capture the correct version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `info` function uses `fish --version` to capture the correct version of the Fish shell and returns it in the expected format. This fix should resolve the hanging initialization issue reported in the GitHub issue.
