The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It should be using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
