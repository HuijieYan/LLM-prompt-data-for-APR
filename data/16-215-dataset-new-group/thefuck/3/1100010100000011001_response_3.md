The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly reading the output from the subprocess and converting it to the expected version string. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` method is not handling the output from the subprocess correctly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the subprocess output is read and decoded correctly to obtain the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `proc.communicate()[0]` method to read the output from the subprocess and decode it correctly. This should fix the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
