The buggy function 'info' from the class 'Fish' is intended to return the name and version of the Fish shell. However, the function attempts to extract the version number from the output of a command that requests the Fish shell version, and this extraction is not handled correctly.

The cause of the bug can be deduced from the failing test and the corresponding error message. The failing test attempts to assert that the 'info' function of the Fish shell returns the correct version, and this assertion fails because the returned value contains additional unwanted information.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the Fish shell version and return it in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we request the Fish shell version using the '--version' flag, which provides the version information in the required format. Then, we extract the version number and create the expected output based on it.
