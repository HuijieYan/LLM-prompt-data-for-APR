The cause of the bug is that the "info" function returns the entire output of the "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" command, including the text "fish, version", which causes the assertion error in the test. The expected output in the test is just "3.5.9", so the function needs to be modified to return only the version number without any additional text.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to only return the version number without the extra text "fish, version". This can be achieved by using regular expressions to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', output).group()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This modified function uses the "re" module to search for a pattern matching the version number in the output and returns only the version without the additional text. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
