The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` class. However, the function incorrectly assumes that the output of the command is the version number, which is not the case.

The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line is attempting to read the output of the command and decode it as UTF-8, but it's not handling the actual output format correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly parse the output of the command and extract the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    version_str = version_bytes.decode('utf-8')
    version = version_str.split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly retrieve the Fish shell version by running the `fish --version` command and parsing the output to extract the version number. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
