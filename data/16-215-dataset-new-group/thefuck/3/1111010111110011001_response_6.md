The problem with the `info` function is that it tries to fetch the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then parse the output. However, the command should be 'fish --version' to get the version string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in the `Popen` call within the `info` function to 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction should make the failing test pass and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
