## Correction

### Analysis
The `info` function is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell, but it uses the incorrect command to retrieve the version, resulting in an incorrect output. The failing test indicates that the expected version is "3.5.9", but the function returns an incorrect result.

### Identified potential error locations
1. The command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect.
2. The decoding and stripping of the version is not handled correctly.

### Cause of the bug
The `info` function is using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" to retrieve the version, but the correct command should be "fish --version". This leads to an incorrect version being returned by the function, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Use the correct command "fish --version" to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
2. Decode and strip the output of the command properly to extract the version string.

### The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the full output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected function uses the correct command to retrieve the version and properly decodes and extracts the version from the output. This should address the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
