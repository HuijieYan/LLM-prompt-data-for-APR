The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the wrong command to get the version of the Fish shell. It is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The command used in Popen to get the version of Fish shell.
2. The decoding of the output from the subprocess.

The cause of the bug is that the incorrect command is being used to retrieve the version of the shell, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` should be modified to use the correct command to get the version of the shell, and the decoding of the output should be handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
