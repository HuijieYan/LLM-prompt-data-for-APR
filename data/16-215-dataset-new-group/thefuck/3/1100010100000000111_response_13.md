The buggy function in shells/fish.py is the info() function, which is used to return the name and version of the current shell. The issue on GitHub indicates that the use of the "-v" option in the thefuck plugin while using Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to the info() function.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the use of the Popen function to execute the command ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] and then reading the output from the process.

The bug is caused by the info() function triggering a recursive loop when the thefuck plugin uses the "-v" option to decide when to regenerate functions. This results in a hang during the Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, the info() function should be modified to avoid triggering a recursive loop when the thefuck plugin is used with the "-v" option. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the info() function to handle the use of the "-v" option in a way that prevents the recursive loop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv:
        return "Fish Shell"
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In this corrected version, the info() function checks if the "-v" option is present in the command line arguments. If it is, the function returns "Fish Shell" to prevent the recursive loop. Otherwise, it executes the original logic to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell.
