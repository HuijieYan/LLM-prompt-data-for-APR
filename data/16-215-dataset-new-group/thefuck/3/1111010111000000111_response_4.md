Potential error locations:
- The Popen command may not be correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell.
- The decoding of the stdout output may not be happening as expected.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect command being used to capture the version of the Fish shell, which leads to a recursive loop when the plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct command to capture the version of the Fish shell.
2. Ensure that the decoding of the stdout output is handled correctly.

Corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
