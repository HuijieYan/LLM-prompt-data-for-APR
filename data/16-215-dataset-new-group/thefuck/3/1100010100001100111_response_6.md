### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file is causing a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used in the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This is because the function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call, but it is not closing the subprocess properly, leading to a recursive loop.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the subprocess needs to be properly closed after reading the version to prevent the recursive loop from occurring.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.stdout.close()  # Close the subprocess after reading the version
    proc.terminate()  # Terminate the subprocess to ensure it is properly closed
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
