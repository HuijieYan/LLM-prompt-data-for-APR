## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `info` function within the `Fish` class. It is meant to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command using `Popen`. However, the issue on GitHub suggests that when the `thefuck -v` command is executed, it triggers a recursive loop because of the `Fish.info()` function, causing the Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin to hang.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the `Popen` command and the way it interacts with the `thefuck -v` command.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `Fish.info()` function triggering a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed. This results in the hang during the Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `Fish.info()` function to prevent it from triggering a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed. This could involve handling the execution of the command differently or adding a condition to the function to check if it's being called by the `thefuck -v` command.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if '-v' in sys.argv:
            return u'Fish Shell'
        else:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
