## Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The Popen command might not be retrieving the correct value for the Fish version.
2. There could be a potential issue with the decoding of the output from the Popen command.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by the info function in the Fish class not correctly retrieving the Fish version, leading to a recursive loop when the plugin-thefuck is used in the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Popen command correctly retrieves the Fish version and that the output is decoded properly.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to capture the output and then decoding it to retrieve the Fish version. This should resolve the issue with the recursive loop and correctly return the version of the Fish shell.
