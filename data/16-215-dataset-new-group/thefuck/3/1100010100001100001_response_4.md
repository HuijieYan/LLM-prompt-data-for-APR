The issue in the buggy function is that the `proc.stdout.read()` method is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the command being executed.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` object is not being used correctly to retrieve the output of the command.

To fix the bug, we should use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object instead of directly reading from the `stdout` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `proc.communicate()` to retrieve the output of the command, we can correctly obtain the version of the Fish shell and return it as expected.
