The cause of the bug is that the `Fish.info` function is not correctly parsing the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The function is not properly handling the output and is returning an incorrect version string.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly parse the version number from the output of the command and return the correct version string.

Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it seems that the output of the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. The current implementation does not handle this format correctly and returns the entire output as the version string.

To fix the bug, the output of the command should be properly parsed to extract the version number '3.5.9' and return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the `Fish.info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function should properly parse the version number from the command output and return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', resolving the issue reported in GitHub and passing the failing test.
