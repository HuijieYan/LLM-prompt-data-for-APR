## Bug Fix

**Analysis:**
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is using the `Popen` function to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, the use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')` can lead to a recursive loop, causing the function to hang.

**Bug Cause:**
The bug is caused by the `Popen` function not being handled properly, which can lead to a recursive loop and hang the function.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to handle the `Popen` function properly and ensure that it does not lead to a recursive loop. This can be done by using the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to read the output and avoid any potential blocking.

**Updated Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `communicate` method is used to read the output of the `Popen` command, avoiding any potential blocking. This should resolve the issue and prevent the function from hanging.
