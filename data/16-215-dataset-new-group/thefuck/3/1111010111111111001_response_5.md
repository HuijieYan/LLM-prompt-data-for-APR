The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is trying to read the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, but the command used to get the version is incorrect. This leads to the wrong version being returned, causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to get the fish shell version. It should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
