The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class fails to correctly extract the version of the fish shell, causing the test to fail.

The error message clearly shows that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The issue lies in the command used to extract the fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' in the Popen call does not correctly retrieve the version.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command to obtain the version of the fish shell correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

By modifying the Popen call to use the command '--version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION', we can correctly extract the version of the fish shell. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
