After analyzing the buggy function, we can see that the issue is with the way the version information is extracted from the subprocess output. The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is returning an incorrect version string. The cause of this bug is the incorrect extraction of version information from the subprocess output.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the way the version information is extracted from the subprocess output. We need to ensure that the correct version string is captured and returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

In this corrected version, we split the version string by `,` and extract the second part, which contains the version number. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct version string is captured and returned.
