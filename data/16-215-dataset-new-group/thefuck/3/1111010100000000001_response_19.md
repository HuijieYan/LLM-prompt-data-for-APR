The potential error locations within the buggy function are the use of Popen to execute the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command and then attempting to read from its stdout.

The cause of the bug is that the Popen process is not being waited for and its stdout is not read correctly. This can lead to the function returning an incorrect version of the Fish shell or not returning at all.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to use the communicate method of the Popen object to properly wait for the process to finish and read its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the communicate method is used to properly wait for the process to finish and read its output.
