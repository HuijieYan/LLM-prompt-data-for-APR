The bug in the `info` function is caused by the fact that the returned value includes the string "fish," which is not expected. The error message states that the expected value is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual value is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The bug is likely caused by the use of the `echo` command in the Popen call, which includes the string "fish," resulting in an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be modified to directly retrieve the value of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'printf $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function directly retrieves the value of the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable using `printf` instead of `echo`, leading to the correct output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as expected.
