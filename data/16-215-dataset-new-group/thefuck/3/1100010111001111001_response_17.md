## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
1. The original function uses the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version of the fish shell, but the test is expecting the command 'fish --version' to be used.
2. The original function reads the output of the process using `proc.stdout.read()` directly, but the test is setting the output to 'fish, version 3.5.9\n'. This causes the mismatch in the expected and actual values.
3. The original function is expecting the version number only, while the test expects the full output including 'fish, version' in the string.
4. The bug can be fixed by updating the command to 'fish --version' and modifying the expected output to match the full output including 'fish, version'.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and matches the expected input/output values, allowing it to pass the failing test.
