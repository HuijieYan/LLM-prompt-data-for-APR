## The bug and its cause
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The bug lies in the `Popen` call, where the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is used to get the fish version. However, the output of the command is not being correctly processed, which results in the incorrect version being returned.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` to get the correct version of the fish shell.
2. Retrieve the output of the `Popen` command using `communicate` method to ensure the correct handling of the output.

## The corrected version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version, the `info` function will retrieve the correct version of the fish shell and return it with the expected format, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
