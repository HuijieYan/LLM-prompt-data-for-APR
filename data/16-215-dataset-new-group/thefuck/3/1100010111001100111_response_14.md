## The corrected version
```python
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function was calling the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of the Fish shell, but the failing test was setting up the mock to expect the command 'fish --version'. The corrected version of the function uses 'fish --version' to get the version of the shell and correctly parses the output to extract the version number.

The fix also addresses the GitHub issue by using 'fish --version', which was mentioned as the correct command in the issue description.
