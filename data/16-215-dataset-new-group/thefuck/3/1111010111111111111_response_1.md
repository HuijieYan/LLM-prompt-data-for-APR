Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug occurs because the function `info` in the `Fish` class is invoking the `thefuck` command recursively, which triggers a recursive loop due to the use of `thefuck -v` in `Fish.info()`. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to avoid this recursive loop.

The corrected version should simply return the version of the Fish shell without calling the `thefuck` command. This can be achieved by directly getting the version of the Fish shell using command `fish --version` or by accessing the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable, without involving the `thefuck` command.

The `info` function can be updated as follows:

```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        # Get the version directly without calling thefuck command
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With the fix, the `info` function will return the correct version of the Fish shell without triggering the recursive loop caused by calling the `thefuck` command.

This is the corrected version of the `info` function in the `Fish` class.
