The problem with the buggy function is that it is not capturing the correct version of the Fish shell, which is causing the failing test. The expected version of the Fish shell is "fish, version 3.5.9", but the function is currently returning only "3.5.9". This is due to the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

To fix this bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell should be updated to align with the expected version format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Now, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. It will also resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version retrieval.
