## Explanation
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess. However, the function is not properly handling the subprocess and its output, leading to the bug.

The `Popen` function is not being called correctly and the output from the subprocess is not being handled properly, which is causing the function to return an incorrect version of the shell.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the correct way to capture the output of the subprocess is to use `communicate` function of the `Popen` object after calling the `communicate` method. Also, the `Popen` object should be closed after communication.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    proc.terminate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The use of `communicate` ensures that the subprocess output is captured correctly, and closing the `Popen` object after communication ensures that system resources are released properly.
