The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is caused by the incorrect command used to get the version of the fish shell. The command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is not the correct way to get the version, and the code is expecting the output to be in a specific format that it is not in.

To fix the bug, the correct command to get the fish shell version should be used. Additionally, the decoding and stripping of the output should be handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', ')[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct version of the fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
