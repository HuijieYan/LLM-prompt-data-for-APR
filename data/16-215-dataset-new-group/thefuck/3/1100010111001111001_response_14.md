The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to retrieve the version of the fish shell using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but it should be using the command 'fish --version' instead. This causes the function to retrieve the incorrect version and fail the test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the Popen command to use 'fish --version' and then parse the output to extract the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract the version number from the output
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
