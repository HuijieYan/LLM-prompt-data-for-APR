## The bug
The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell. This causes issues when the `thefuck` plugin is used with Oh-My-Fish, leading to a recursive loop.

The cause of the bug is in the `Popen` call, where `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` should be used instead of `['fish', '--version']` to get the correct version of the Fish shell.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the Popen call to `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the correct Fish shell version.
2. Use the retrieved version to format the return string as `'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the Popen call and retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell, the function should now return the expected version and resolve the issue with the recursive loop when using the `thefuck` plugin with Oh-My-Fish.
