The bug in the function is that it is not properly reading the output of the `Popen` process to get the version of the Fish shell. It is using a MagicMock instance instead of the actual output from the process.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to properly read the standard output of the process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
