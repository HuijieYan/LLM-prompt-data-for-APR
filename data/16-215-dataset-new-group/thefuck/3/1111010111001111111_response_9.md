The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` with the `-c` option in the subprocess call, but the correct command to get the version is `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the subprocess call in the `info` function to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test case. This also addresses the issue posted on GitHub regarding the hang in Fish Shell initialization when using the oh-my-fish plugin.
