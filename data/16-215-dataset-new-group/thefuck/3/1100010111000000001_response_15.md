The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The Popen command is using ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] instead of ['fish', '--version'] which is inconsistent with the test code.
2. The test is expecting the output of the version to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the function is formatting it as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

The cause of the bug is that the command used in the Popen function is different from the one expected in the test. Additionally, the formatting of the version output is not consistent with the expected output in the test.

To fix the bug:
1. Change the command in the Popen function to ['fish', '--version'] to match the expected command in the test code.
2. Update the formatting of the version output to match the expected output in the test code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version number from the output
    version = version.split(", version ")[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
