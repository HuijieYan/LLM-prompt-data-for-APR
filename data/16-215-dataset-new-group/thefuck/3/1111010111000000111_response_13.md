The issue here is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not correctly retrieving the version of the Fish shell. This causes the test case to fail, as it expects the correct version to be returned.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell. The correct command is `fish --version`.

To fix this bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and the test case should pass. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect command.
