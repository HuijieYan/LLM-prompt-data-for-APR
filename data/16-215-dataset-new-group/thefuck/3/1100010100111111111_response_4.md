The bug in the `info` function is caused by reading the version from the `Popen` stdout using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, which returns the version with additional text "fish, version" included.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to return the version without the additional text "fish, version".

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')  # Remove 'fish, version' text
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By replacing the 'fish, version ' in the `version` string, we can extract only the version number, which will ensure that the function returns the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9" and resolves the failing test.
