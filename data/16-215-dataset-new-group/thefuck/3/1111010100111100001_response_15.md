The bug in the provided function is that the returned version string includes the text "fish, version" instead of just the version number.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Instead of just extracting the version number, it is returning the entire output with the text "fish, version" included.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code so that it correctly extracts only the version number from the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', version')[1].strip()  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly return the version number without the extra text, and the failing test should pass.
