## Explanation
The issue occurs because the function `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` package is calling `thefuck -v` within the Fish Shell, which triggers a recursive loop and causes the function to hang. This is due to the way the `Popen` command is used to execute the `thefuck -v` command, and the subsequent handling of the output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `thefuck -v` command is not triggered within a recursive loop and that the output handling is done properly to prevent it from hanging.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['echo', '$FISH_VERSION'], shell=True,
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, env=os.environ)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
This corrected version uses `Popen` to execute the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command and fetches the output using the `communicate` method instead of directly reading from the stdout. This prevents the recursive loop and properly handles the output, resolving the hanging issue.
