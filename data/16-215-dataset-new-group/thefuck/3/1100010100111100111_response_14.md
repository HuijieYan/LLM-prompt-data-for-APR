The problem with the current function `info` is that it is returning the version of Fish Shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using Popen and then reading the output. The issue is that the output includes the text "Fish Shell" along with the version number and this is causing a mismatch when the function is being tested.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output and then format it into the desired string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the output of the command on the comma and taking the second part, we can extract just the version number. This modified version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
