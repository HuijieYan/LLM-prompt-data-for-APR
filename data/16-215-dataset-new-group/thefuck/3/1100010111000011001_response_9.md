The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version, and it is not parsing the output correctly.

The `Popen` call should be using ['fish', '--version'] instead of ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] to get the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, the output needs to be parsed to extract the version number.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be modified as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the fixed function, it should pass the failing test and return the correct version of the Fish shell.
