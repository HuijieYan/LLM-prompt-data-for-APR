The bug in this function is caused by not properly handling the communication with the subprocess that executes the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command. The function is returning an incorrect value because it is not properly reading the output from the subprocess.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess output is properly captured and decoded before returning the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method to read the output of the subprocess and then decode it properly before returning the version string. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct version of the Fish shell.
