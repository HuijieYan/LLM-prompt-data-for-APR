The bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class is causing a recursive loop, as reported in the GitHub issue. The issue arises from the use of `thefuck -v` triggering a recursive loop due to the way the `Fish.info()` method is implemented.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` method is not returning the expected version format `'fish, version 3.5.9'` as indicated in the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` method to handle the version string appropriately and return the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```
