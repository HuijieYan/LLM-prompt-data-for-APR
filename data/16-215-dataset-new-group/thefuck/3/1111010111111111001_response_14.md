The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is trying to get the version of the fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` but it should be using `fish --version` instead. This causes the version variable to contain an unexpected value, leading to a failed test.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be updated to use the correct command to get the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass.
