Based on the error message and the runtime values of variables, it seems that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the version number from the `stdout` of the `Popen` process. The issue on GitHub also mentions that the function is triggering a recursive loop, indicating that the version number is not being extracted correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being misinterpreted, leading to the incorrect version string being returned.

To fix the bug, I will modify the `info` function to correctly parse the version from the `stdout` of the `Popen` process. Additionally, I will check for the specific output format of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command and format the version string accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    if version.startswith('fish, version'):
        version = version[len('fish, version '):]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should correctly extract the version number from the `Popen` process output and return the expected version string. This should resolve the failing test and also address the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
