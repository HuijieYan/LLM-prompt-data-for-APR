## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function uses the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to fetch the version of the Fish shell, which may not work in all cases, especially when using plugins like Oh-My-Fish. This can lead to a recursive loop as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the command used to fetch the Fish shell version can be changed to 'fish --version' which is more reliable and does not trigger the recursive loop.

The corrected version of the function passes the failing test and resolves the issue posted on GitHub by using 'fish --version' to fetch the version of the Fish shell.
