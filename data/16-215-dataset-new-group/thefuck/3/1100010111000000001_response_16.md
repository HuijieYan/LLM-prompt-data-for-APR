The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The command being passed to Popen is ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], but the test is looking for ['fish', '--version'].
2. The method of reading from `proc.stdout` may not be reliable.

The cause of the bug is that the command passed to Popen is not retrieving the correct version of the fish shell, and it's not matching the expected output in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command passed to Popen to ['fish', '--version'] and modify the way the output is read to ensure accuracy.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the test should pass successfully.
