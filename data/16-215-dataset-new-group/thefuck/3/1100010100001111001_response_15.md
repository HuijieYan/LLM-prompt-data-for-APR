Based on the provided information, the bug in the "info" function is that it is expecting the variable "version" to have a specific format, but the format returned by the Popen command is different.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command executed in the Popen call to retrieve the correct version information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the Popen command to use the "--version" option to retrieve the shell version information in the expected format. With this change, the function should now return the expected version information.
