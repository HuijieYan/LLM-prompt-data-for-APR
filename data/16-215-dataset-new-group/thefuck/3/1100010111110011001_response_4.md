Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

Explanation:
The original function was using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, the test was expecting the command 'fish --version' to be used. This caused the function to return a version string in the wrong format and resulted in the failing test.

The fix involves changing the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to 'fish --version' and then extracting the version number from the returned string.

Now, the corrected function will return the version number in the expected format, passing the failing test.

The corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
