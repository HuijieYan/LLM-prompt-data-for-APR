## The identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The command used in Popen is ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], while the test is expecting ['fish', '--version'].
2. The reading of the stdout from the Popen object may not be handled correctly.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used in Popen and the incorrect handling of the stdout while reading the version of the Fish shell. This leads to the function returning an incorrect version of the Fish shell, causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the command in Popen to ['fish', '--version'] to match the expected value in the test.
2. Properly handle the reading of the stdout to extract the version information.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
