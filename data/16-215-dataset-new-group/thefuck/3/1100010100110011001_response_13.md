The cause of the bug is that the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command includes the string 'fish, version' in the output, which is causing the version variable to be assigned as 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of '3.5.9'.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the command passed to Popen to only output the version number without the extra string 'fish, version'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $fish_version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the command passed to Popen is modified to 'echo $fish_version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which is expected to provide the correct version number without the extra string.
