## Fix strategy
Based on the failing test and the error message, the issue seems to be related to the way the version of Fish shell is being extracted in the `info` function. To fix this bug, we should modify the command being executed by Popen to fetch the Fish shell version. 

We will change the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']` to properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. This should resolve the recursion and provide the correct version value.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
