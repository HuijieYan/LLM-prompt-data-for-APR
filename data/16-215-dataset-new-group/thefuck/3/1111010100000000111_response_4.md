## Analysis and Bug Fix

The bug is caused by the `info` method in the `Fish` class in `fish.py` file. When the `thefuck -v` command is used, it triggers a recursive loop because the `info` method calls the `thefuck -v` command internally. This causes the program to hang.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` method to not trigger the recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if '-v' in sys.argv:
            return ''  # Return an empty string when the -v flag is used
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `-v` flag is present in the command-line arguments. If it is, we simply return an empty string, thereby avoiding the recursive loop. If the `-v` flag is not present, we proceed with the original logic for getting the name and version of the current shell.
