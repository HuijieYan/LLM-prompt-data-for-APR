The issue with the buggy function is that it is not using the correct command to retrieve the fish shell version, and it is not handling the output correctly. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the fish shell version, which is not the correct command. This results in incorrect output being returned, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command used to retrieve the fish shell version to 'fish --version', and correctly handle the output to extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly retrieve the fish shell version and pass the failing test.
