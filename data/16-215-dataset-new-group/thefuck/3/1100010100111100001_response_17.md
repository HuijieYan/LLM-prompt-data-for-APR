The issue with the buggy function is that it is reading the version from the output of the command incorrectly. In the failing test, the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' while the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This indicates that the function is not correctly parsing the version from the command output.

To fix this, we need to update the function to correctly parse the version from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should properly extract the version from the command output, and the failing test should pass.
