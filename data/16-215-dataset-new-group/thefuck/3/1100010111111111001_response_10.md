The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `'fish --version'` to retrieve the version of the fish shell. This causes the returned value to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the fish shell and pass the failing test.
