## Analysis
The error message indicates that the function is returning "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9" instead of the expected "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This suggests that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the version string along with the term "fish, version".

The GitHub issue also mentions a recursive loop being triggered by `thefuck -v`. This loop is likely caused by the incorrect output of the `info` function, leading to the recursive initialization of the shell.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `info` function, specifically in the command being executed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect parsing of the version string from the command output, leading to the inclusion of unwanted text ("fish, version") in the shell info.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the parsing of the version string from the command output needs to be corrected to remove the unwanted text and only return the version number. Additionally, the fix should also address the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect output.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_string = version.split(", ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_string)
```
