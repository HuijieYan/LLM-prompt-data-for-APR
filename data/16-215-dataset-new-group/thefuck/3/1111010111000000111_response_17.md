## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class, test code, the GitHub issue.
- The buggy function is `info` within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of `thefuck` project.
- The failing test is in the `test_fish.py` file.
- The GitHub issue states that the `-v` argument triggers a recursive loop due to the `info` function being called.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.
- The `Popen` command might not be capturing the correct version of the Fish shell.
- The decoding or stripping of the output from `Popen` might not be handled correctly.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information.
The bug is caused because the `info` function is not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell. This leads to problems when the `-v` argument is used and a recursive loop is triggered.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.
- Adjust the `Popen` command to correctly fetch the version information of the Fish shell.
- Ensure that the output from `Popen` is decoded and stripped properly to avoid any recursive loops.

## A corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected version of the `info` function, the version of the Fish shell is correctly captured, decoded, and stripped to avoid any issues, including the recursive loops triggered by the `-v` argument.
