The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is trying to fetch the version of the fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function, but it should be using the command `fish --version` instead.

The failing test is asserting that the output of the `info` function should be "Fish Shell 3.5.9", but the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed by `Popen` to fetch the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct version of the fish shell and pass the failing test.
