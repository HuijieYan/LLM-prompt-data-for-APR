The issue with the buggy function lies in the fact that it reads `fish, version 3.5.9` when it should be reading `3.5.9` only.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is returning the full output of the `fish -v` command, including the "fish, version" string, instead of just the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to extract and return only the version number from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number from the output
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '') 
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function will now return the correct version number without the "fish, version" string, and it will pass the failing test.
