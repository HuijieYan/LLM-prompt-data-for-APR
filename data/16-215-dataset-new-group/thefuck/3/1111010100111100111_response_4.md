#### Fixing the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is incorrectly parsing the version output from the `fish` command. The function is currently returning the string `'Fish Shell <version>'` where the version includes the word "fish," which is not correct. The correct version should be extracted from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the parsing of the version to extract only the version number from the output of the `fish` command.
2. Modify the return statement to include the extracted version in the correct format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        
        # Parse the version from the output
        version = version_output.split(', version ')[1]

        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly parse the version from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and return it in the format 'Fish Shell <version>'.

This correction should resolve the failing test and also address the issue reported on GitHub.
