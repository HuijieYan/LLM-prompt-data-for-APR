## Analysis
The buggy function is `info`, which is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` class from the `subprocess` module to run a command and fetch the version of the Fish shell. The error message suggests that the version output contains an unexpected additional string `"fish, version"`.

## Error Location
The error originates from the `info` function, where it tries to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `Popen` class. The unexpected string is part of the version output, indicating that the command execution is not producing the expected output.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely that the command executed by `Popen` is returning the version string along with the extra string "fish, version". This additional string is being included in the returned version, resulting in an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The `Popen` function may be capturing the entire output, including the command itself, when trying to fetch the version. A potential solution is to modify the command provided to `Popen` to only return the version string without the additional "fish, version" prefix.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        # Extract only the version portion from the returned string
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '') 
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
