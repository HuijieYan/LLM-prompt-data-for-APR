### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is that it is using a MagicMock object instead of actually executing the command to get the version of the Fish Shell. The Popen function is not actually running the command, but instead returning a MagicMock object.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the Popen function should be used to execute the command and capture its output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
