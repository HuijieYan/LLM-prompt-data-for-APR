# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], 
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)  # Fixed to use PIPE for stderr
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the original function lies in the usage of the `DEVNULL` constant, which is most likely not defined, causing an error. 

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by using the `PIPE` constant for `stderr` instead of `DEVNULL`.

The corrected version of the function has been provided above.
