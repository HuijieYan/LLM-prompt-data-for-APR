## Fixing the Bug

The bug appears to be located in the `info` function where it tries to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the command being executed is `fish --version` but the expected output is being compared with the actual output.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the command being executed to `fish --version` and then compare the version obtained from the command with the expected version.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version[12:])
```
