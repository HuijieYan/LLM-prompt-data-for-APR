To debug the provided function, we need to consider the following:

1. The `info` function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell and return it with the "Fish Shell" prefix.

2. The `test_info` function mocks the call to `Popen` and sets the return value of `stdout.read` to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.

The potential error locations within the `info` function are:
- The command being passed to `Popen` might not be correct.
- The decoding of the stdout might cause an issue.

The cause of the bug is that the command passed to `Popen` in the `info` function should be `['fish', '--version']` to get the version information from the Fish shell, but it is currently `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. Additionally, the decoding of the stdout might not work as intended.

To fix the bug, we should change the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` and also modify the decoding of the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version_string = version.split(', ')[1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version_string}'
```

In this corrected version, we have changed the command passed to `Popen` to `['fish', '--version']` and modified the decoding of the stdout to extract the version string.
