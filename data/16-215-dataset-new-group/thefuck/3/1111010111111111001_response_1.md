The problem with the current implementation is that the command passed to the Popen constructor is incorrect, and the reading of the stdout is not being handled properly. 

The `info` function is currently trying to get the version by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the shell, which doesn't return the expected output.

To fix this bug, we should change the command passed to Popen to `['fish', '--version']`, which would return the version directly. Additionally, we should use `communicate()` to properly read the output of the subprocess.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the `info` function should now return the expected output and pass the failing test.
