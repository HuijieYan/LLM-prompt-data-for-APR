The issue with the buggy function is that it is calling the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command to get the version of the Fish shell, but the test is expecting the command '--version' to be used instead. This causes the function to return the incorrect version format, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen call to use the '--version' flag instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly return the version of the Fish shell in the expected format, passing the failing test.
