The potential error in the buggy function is that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is being used to get the version of the fish shell, but the actual version command should be `['fish', '--version']`. 

The cause of the bug is that the incorrect command is being used to extract the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be changed from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace("fish, version ", ""))
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
