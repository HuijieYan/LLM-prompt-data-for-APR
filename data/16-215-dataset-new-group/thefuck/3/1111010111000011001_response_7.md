The issue with the buggy function is that it is not parsing the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, and also not handling the output properly. Here's a step by step approach to fix the bug:

1. The `Popen` command is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version. It should be using `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. The output of `Popen` is not being handled correctly. It should be reading the output of the process and decoding it as UTF-8 before stripping any whitespace.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This version should pass the failing test case, as it correctly retrieves and parses the Fish shell version from the `Popen` output.
