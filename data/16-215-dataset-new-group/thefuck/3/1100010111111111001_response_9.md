The problem with the buggy function is that it is trying to read the version of the Fish shell using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" when it should instead use "fish --version" to get the version information. This is evident from the test failure, which shows that the expected version is "fish, version 3.5.9" but the actual version is "3.5.9".

To fix this bug, we need to update the command in the Popen call to "fish --version".

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With this fix, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
