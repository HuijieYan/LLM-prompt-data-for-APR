### Analysis
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is responsible for retrieving the name and version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` subprocess is used to execute a command to echo the Fish version and capture its output. However, the test fails with an assertion error because the expected version string does not match the actual output.

The error message indicates that the function is returning the entire command output instead of just the version number. This is causing the assertion to fail.

The GitHub issue suggests that the `info` function causes a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is executed, and a fix is on the way.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `info` function returning the entire output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command instead of just the version number. This discrepancy causes the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The fix involves modifying the `info` function to extract and return only the version number from the command output. This should resolve the failing test and prevent the recursive loop issue described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the output
    # Extract the version number from the output
    version_number = version.split(',')[1].strip().split(' ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```
