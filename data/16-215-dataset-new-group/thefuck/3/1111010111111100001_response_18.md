The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

The line `proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` executes the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, which does not actually return the shell version. This is why the test is failing with the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command being executed to retrieve the Fish shell version. The correct command would be `fish --version`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass.
