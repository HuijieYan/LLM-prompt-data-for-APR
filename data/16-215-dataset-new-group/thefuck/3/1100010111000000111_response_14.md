Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The Popen call might be incorrect, causing the command to not execute as expected.
2. The format of the version string might not match the expected output of the command.

Cause of the bug:
The issue on GitHub indicates that the thefuck -v command triggers a recursive loop in the Fish.info() function. This suggests that the Popen call to execute the command is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the format of the version string might not match the expected output of the command, causing the test to fail.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the Popen call to correctly execute the command.
2. Ensure that the version string is extracted and formatted correctly to match the expected output.

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the Popen call to use ['fish', '--version'] and then extracting and formatting the version string, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
