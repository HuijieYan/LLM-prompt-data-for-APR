The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the fish version is incorrect. The expected version output `fish, version 3.5.9` is not being matched with the actual version output `3.5.9`. This indicates that the command being run is not the correct one.

To fix the bug, the command being run in the `info` function should be changed to retrieve the correct version string.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell ' + version.replace('fish, version ', '')
```

By replacing the command with `['fish', '--version']`, we can ensure that the correct version string is retrieved. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output.
