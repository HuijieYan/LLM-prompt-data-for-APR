## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The potential error location was identified as the command passed to Popen. The original function used `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` which does not match the expected command `['fish', '--version']` in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the original function was not retrieving the shell version correctly due to using the wrong command for Popen. This caused the failing test to not return the expected shell version.

To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the correct shell version.

The corrected version of the function has been provided above. This version uses the correct command to retrieve the shell version and is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the original buggy function.
