## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function is part of the `Fish` class and is called `info`. It is meant to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command in the Fish shell using the `subprocess.Popen` function.

## Potential error locations
The potential error in the function lies in the way the command is executed using `Popen` and how the output is read from the subprocess.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the `Popen` command using the wrong arguments ('fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION') which does not match the actual command pattern used in the failing test. Additionally, the method of reading the output from the subprocess is incorrect.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by using the correct command pattern for the subprocess and ensuring the output is read using the appropriate method.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

By correcting the command pattern to `['fish', '--version']`, which matches the pattern used in the failing test, and reading the version from the output using `split()`, the buggy function is fixed.
