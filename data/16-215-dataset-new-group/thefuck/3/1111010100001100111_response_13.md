## Fixed version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'set -q FISH_VERSION; and echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

### Explanation
The original buggy function uses `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the Fish shell. However, this causes a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, as noted in the GitHub issue. The fix for this issue is to use `set -q FISH_VERSION; and echo $FISH_VERSION` instead. This modification ensures that the version is retrieved without causing a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

The fixed function includes this modification and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
