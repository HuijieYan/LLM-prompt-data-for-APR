# The cause of the bug:
The `info` function in the `shells/fish.py` file is attempting to get the Fish Shell version by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. This should be `fish --version` instead. Additionally, the test case is expecting the version string to be `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning just `'3.5.9'`.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command in the `Popen` function to `fish --version`.
2. Modify the function to parse the version string correctly and return it in the expected format.

# The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting the version number from 'fish, version x.y.z'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly return the version in the expected format, and the test case should pass.
