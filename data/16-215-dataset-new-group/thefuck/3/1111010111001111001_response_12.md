The bug in the `info` function is in the Popen call. The command used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, which is causing the test to fail.

The strategy to fix the bug is to change the command used in the Popen call to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the `info` function uses the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, which should satisfy the failing test and produce the expected output.
