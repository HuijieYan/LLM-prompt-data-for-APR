The issue with the buggy function `info` in the class `Fish` is that it uses `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version of Fish shell, but the test is expecting `['fish', '--version']`, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version so that it matches what the test is expecting.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version using the `--version` flag, matching the expectations of the test, and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
