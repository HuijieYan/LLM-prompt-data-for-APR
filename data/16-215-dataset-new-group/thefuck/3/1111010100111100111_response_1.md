## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The issue arises from the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` which returns the version with some additional text.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, resulting in additional text being included in the version number.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` needs to be parsed to extract only the version number without any additional text.

## Corrected Version
```python
import re

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        match = re.match(r'fish, version (\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', version)
        if match:
            version = match.group(1)
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In this corrected version, the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is parsed using a regular expression to extract only the version number without any additional text. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `info` function returns the correct version number.
