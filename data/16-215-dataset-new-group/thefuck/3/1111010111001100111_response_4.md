## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. The issue seems to be related to the `info` function in `shells/fish.py` being called recursively. This may be due to the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` inside the `info` function, which could trigger the recursive loop.
2. In the failing test, the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, so the fix should ensure that the version number is correctly extracted from the output of `fish -v` command and formatted as `'Fish Shell <version>'`.
3. The `Popen` call should be modified to execute `fish -v` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish shell version without triggering a recursive loop.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(', version ')[1].strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By modifying the `Popen` call to execute `fish --version` and correctly parsing the output to extract the version number, the recursive loop should be avoided, and the function should now return the expected value, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
