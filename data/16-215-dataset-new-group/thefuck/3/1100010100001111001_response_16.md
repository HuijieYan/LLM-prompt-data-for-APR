The issue with the provided buggy function is that it's not correctly capturing the version of the Fish shell. It's returning only the version number without the expected label "fish, version" included in the output.

The bug is caused by the string formatting in the return statement, where it only appends the version number without the label "fish, version".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement to include the label "fish, version" in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly append the label "fish, version" to the shell version number, satisfying the expected input/output values.
