## Bug analysis
The bug occurs in the `info` function of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using Popen, but it is not capturing the correct output.

The expected output should be `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'3.5.9'`. This is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

## Bug cause
The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell (`'echo $FISH_VERSION'`) is not returning the expected output format. It seems that it's just returning the version number without the additional text `'fish, version'`.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell so that it includes the additional text `'fish, version'`.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the command to `'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'`, we ensure that the expected version format is retrieved. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
