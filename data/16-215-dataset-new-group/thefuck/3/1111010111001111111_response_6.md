## Analysis
The bug seems to be in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it's currently reading the version incorrectly, leading to test failures.

The expected version of the Fish shell is 'fish, version 3.5.9', but the buggy function is reading only the version number '3.5.9'.

This bug has been identified in a GitHub issue related to using Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, which triggers a recursive loop due to the incorrect behavior of the `Fish.info()` function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `info` function should read the full version string 'fish, version 3.5.9' rather than just the version number '3.5.9'.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_output.split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the '--version' flag in the Popen command, we're ensuring that the full version string 'fish, version 3.5.9' is read. Then, we extract the version number from the full string and return the correct version information. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
