## Identification of potential error locations:
1. The Popen command to retrieve the fish version.
2. The encoding format used to decode the output.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` function not correctly parsing the output of the `fish -v` command. It is not correctly extracting the version number, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual version numbers. This causes the test to fail.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the command used to retrieve the fish version and ensuring that the output is correctly parsed to extract only the version number. Additionally, using a more robust method to handle the decoding of the output is necessary to prevent any potential encoding related issues.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
