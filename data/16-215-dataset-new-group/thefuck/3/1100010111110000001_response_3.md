The bug occurs in the info function where the command to retrieve the fish version is incorrect. The command "echo $FISH_VERSION" should be replaced with "--version" to retrieve the actual version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the info function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the correct command to retrieve the version, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
