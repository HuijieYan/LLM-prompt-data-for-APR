## Bug Fix Strategy
The buggy function is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION", but the test function is expecting it to use the command "--version". Additionally, the function is not using the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, which is leading to the recursive loop described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the command used in Popen to ['fish', '--version'] to match the expectation in the test function.
2. Use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version ('fish --version') and process the output to extract the version number.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
