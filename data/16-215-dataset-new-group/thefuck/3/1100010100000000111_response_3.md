## Analysis
The provided function is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output. However, there is a reported issue that when using the `-v` option with the thefuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish, it causes a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function.

## Error Locations
The error in the function is likely due to the use of the `-v` option triggering a recursive loop in the `Fish.info()` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is using the `-v` option triggering a recursive loop due to the way the `Fish.info()` function is capturing the version of the Fish shell.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the `Fish.info()` function to capture the version of the Fish shell in a way that does not trigger a recursive loop when using the `-v` option with the thefuck plugin.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv:
        return ''

    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if the `-v` option is present in the command-line arguments and return an empty string if it exists. This prevents the recursive loop when using the `-v` option. If the `-v` option is not present, the function proceeds to capture the version of the Fish shell as before.
