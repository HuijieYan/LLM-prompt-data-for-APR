The issue with the original buggy function is that it is trying to extract the Fish version by running the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" in a subprocess. However, the correct command to get the Fish version is "fish --version". Additionally, the assertion in the failing test function expects the version to be in the format "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of "3.5.9".

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to execute the correct command to obtain the Fish version, and the return format should be adjusted to match the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version.replace("fish, version ", "")}'
```

In this corrected version, we use the command "fish --version" to capture the version string and then modify the return statement to match the expected output format.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
