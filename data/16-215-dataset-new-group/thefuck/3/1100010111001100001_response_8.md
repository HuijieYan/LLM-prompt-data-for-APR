The bug in the `info` function is caused by using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is calling `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` instead of `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, we should update the `Popen` command to use `fish --version` to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
