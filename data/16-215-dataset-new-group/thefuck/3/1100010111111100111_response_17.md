### The identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The Popen call with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` may not return the expected version string due to the use of a different command.

### Explanation of the bug
The failing test `test_info` calls the `shell.info()` function and expects it to return the string "Fish Shell 3.5.9", but the actual return value is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9". This discrepancy indicates that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` used in the `info` function is not retrieving the correct version number.

The provided GitHub issue also explains that the plugin is triggering a recursive loop because of the `info` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, the command used with Popen in the `info` function should be changed to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to `['fish', '--version']`, the `info` function will correctly retrieve the version string "3.5.9" and return the expected result "Fish Shell 3.5.9". This should resolve the failing test and address the issue posted on GitHub.
