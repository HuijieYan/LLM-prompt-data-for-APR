### Analysis
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing its output. However, the retrieved version contains additional information "fish, version" which is not required, leading to a failed test. The error message indicates that the expected output is "Fish Shell 3.5.9" but the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9". The GitHub issue suggests that this buggy behavior triggers a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

### Identification of Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is in the line where the version is retrieved from the command output using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the retrieved version includes the additional text "fish, version" and the buggy function does not handle this correctly.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the version, so it only returns the version number without any additional text.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the retrieved version using the comma and extracting the second part (version number), the corrected version of the function should now return the expected output and resolve the GitHub issue.
