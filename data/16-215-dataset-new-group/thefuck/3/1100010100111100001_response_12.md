The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and reading its output. However, the returned version includes the string "fish, version" which is causing the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` returns the version string with "fish, version" prefixed to it, causing the mismatch in the assertion.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command to strip off the "fish, version" prefix from the version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
