The root cause of the bug is that the `Popen` object is not being handled properly, and the `stdout.read()` method is not being awaited before the return statement. This leads to incorrect handling of the subprocess and results in an unexpected output.

To fix the bug:
1. Await the `proc.stdout.read()` method to wait for the subprocess to finish and read the output.
2. Capture any potential errors that may occur during the subprocess execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import asyncio

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec('fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION',
                                                stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, stderr = await proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
