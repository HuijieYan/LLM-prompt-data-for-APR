## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

With the corrected version, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. The function now correctly retrieves the version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop.
