## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the function is likely related to the way the Popen object is used to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The issue on GitHub suggests that this command triggers a recursive loop, indicating that the function may not be properly capturing the shell version. Additionally, the usage of `proc.stdout.read()` and `proc.stdout` may also be causing the issue.


## Explanation of the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the runtime input/output variable values, the GitHub Issue information
Based on the provided runtime values, it seems that the Popen command is being executed properly, but there may be issues with reading the output from the process. This could lead to the function not returning the correct shell version, which may trigger the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.


## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the output from the Popen command is being read correctly and that the correct shell version is being captured. It may also be necessary to handle any potential errors that could lead to the recursive loop.


## Corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any potential errors here
            return "Error retrieving shell version"
```

In the corrected version, the `Popen` command is replaced with `proc.communicate()` to properly read the output from the process. Additionally, a try-except block is added to handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution of the command. This should prevent the recursive loop and ensure that the correct shell version is captured.
