The issue with the current buggy function is that it's not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. As a result, the assertion in the failing test is not passing because the expected and actual output are not matching.

The cause of this bug is that the function is not correctly processing the output of the command and extracting the version number from it. As a result, the version number is not being formatted properly in the return statement.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly process the output of the command and extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should correctly extract the version number from the output of the command and format it as expected. This should make the failing test pass.
