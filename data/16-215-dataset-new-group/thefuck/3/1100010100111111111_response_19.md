After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue in the buggy function stems from the use of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version of Fish Shell. The expected output includes the string "fish, version" before the actual version number, while the buggy function does not account for this.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the "fish, version" string along with the version number. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(",")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip())
```

This updated function retrieves the version using `fish --version` and then extracts the version number from the output by splitting the string at the comma. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected output.
