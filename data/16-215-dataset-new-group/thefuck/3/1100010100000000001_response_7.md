## Fixing the buggy function

### Analyzing the buggy function
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` function to execute a command in the fish shell and fetches the version from the output.

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error in the function is related to how the output is read from the `Popen` process. Using `proc.stdout.read()` can lead to issues including incomplete or blocked reading of the output.

### Cause of the bug
The bug in the code arises from reading the output directly using `proc.stdout.read()`, which can block if the output is large, causing the function to hang and become unresponsive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, it's better to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object instead of directly reading from the `stdout`. This method will efficiently read the output and also handle any potential blocking issues.

### Corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the `communicate()` method is used to efficiently read the output without the risk of blocking issues.
