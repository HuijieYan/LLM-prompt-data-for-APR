The bug in the given function seems to be related to the usage of the `stdout.read()` method and the handling of the subprocess Popen object.

The `proc.stdout.read()` method is returning a MagicMock object instead of the actual output of the command. This indicates that the subprocess Popen object is not being executed properly, and the output is not being captured correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the subprocess command is executed and its output is captured correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `proc.communicate()` method to capture the output of the subprocess command. Then we decode the output and strip any trailing whitespace to get the version of the Fish shell.
