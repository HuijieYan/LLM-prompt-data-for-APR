The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is that it is not correctly parsing the version string returned by the `Popen` command. The expected version string is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the function is not properly extracting just the version number from this string before constructing the final output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string on the `, version ` separator and taking the second part, we can extract just the version number from the output of the command.

With this correction, the function should now correctly parse the version string and construct the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This will make the function pass the failing test.
