The bug in the `info` function lies in the way it reads the version from the `proc.stdout`. The expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` due to the incorrect handling of the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the version is extracted from the `proc.stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix modifies the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to include `.split(", ")[1]`. This change ensures that only the version number is extracted from the output, addressing the bug in the original function.

With this fix, the function should now return the expected output of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` and pass the failing test.
