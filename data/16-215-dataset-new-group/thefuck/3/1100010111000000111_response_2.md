The buggy function has the potential error location in the `Popen` call where `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is executed. The `Popen` command is using the wrong argument to get the fish shell version, and the `assert` in the test function `test_info` is also using the wrong call_args.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the fish shell version, while the `assert` in the test function is using the wrong call_args. This results in a failing test and a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin triggers `-v` in the Fish Shell.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `Popen` command to use `['fish', '--version']` to correctly get the fish shell version, and update the `assert Popen.call_args[0][0]` in the test function to `['fish', '--version']` as well.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the test function `test_info` should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
