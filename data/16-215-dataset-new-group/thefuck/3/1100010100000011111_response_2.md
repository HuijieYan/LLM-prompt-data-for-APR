The buggy function shown above has a potential bug in the way it handles the `Popen` process and reads the output.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` process is not being waited for, and the output is being read before the process has completed. This can lead to a potential race condition where the output may not be available yet when the `stdout.read()` method is called.

To fix the bug, we need to wait for the `Popen` process to complete before reading its output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to complete
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the `proc.wait()` call before reading the output, we ensure that the process has completed and its output is available to be read. This should fix the potential race condition and resolve the bug.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
