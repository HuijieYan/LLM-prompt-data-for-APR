### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The incorrect command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is being used to fetch the version, which is causing the unexpected output.
2. We should modify the command to `fish --version` to get the correct version string.
3. The retrieved version also includes the word "fish, version", so we need to extract the version number from this string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the command to fetch the version is changed to `fish --version`, and the version is extracted by splitting the output string and getting the last part.

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
