The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is failing because it's returning the wrong version of the Fish Shell. There are a few potential error locations within the function, including the use of the Popen command and the string formatting for the version.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect value being returned by the function. The expected value for the Fish Shell version is 'fish, version 3.5.9', but the function is returning 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This mismatch is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly retrieve and format the Fish Shell version. We should also consider the possibility of a recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we're using the `fish --version` command to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell and then formatting it as 'Fish Shell version_number'. This should resolve the failing test and match the expected input/output values. Additionally, the fix should address the potential recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
