The buggy function `info` in the `fish.py` file is intended to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. However, it is currently not correctly parsing the version number, leading to a failed test case.

Upon analyzing the failing test case, it is evident that the issue lies in the parsing of the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output includes the string 'fish, version' before the version number.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command to extract the version number from the string 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to modify the parsing logic to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(' ')[-1]  # Extracting the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly parse the version number from the output of the command and return the expected result 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
