The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, which leads to the incorrect version being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This will ensure that the correct version is obtained and returned by the info function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the info function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, allowing the failing test to pass.
