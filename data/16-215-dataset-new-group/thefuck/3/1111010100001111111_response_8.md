To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with the recursive loop caused by the `thefuck -v` command triggering the `Fish.info()` function. The issue seems to be related to the version string being retrieved from the `fish` shell and causing a recursive loop.

We can fix the bug by modifying the command used to retrieve the version of the `fish` shell and ensuring that it doesn't trigger the recursive loop. We can also update the expected return value accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

By using `['fish', '-version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, we avoid triggering the recursive loop caused by the original implementation. This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and provide the expected return value.
