The buggy function `info` is designed to return the version of the Fish shell by using the Popen function to execute a command and retrieve the version.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The command used in Popen may not be retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell.
2. The decoding of the stdout may not be done correctly, leading to an incorrect version value being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the `Popen` call in the `info` function is using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version, and the decoding of the stdout is not being handled properly.

To fix the bug, the command used in the `Popen` call should be updated to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and the decoding of the `stdout` should be modified to ensure the correct version value is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command used in the `Popen` call has been updated to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version, and the decoding of the `stdout` has been modified to extract the version from the output. Now, the `info` function should pass the failing test.
