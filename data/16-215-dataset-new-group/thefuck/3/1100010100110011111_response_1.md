## The analysis of the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The `info` function in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` library is designed to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. However, the current implementation is not handling the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command properly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual versions.

The GitHub issue reveals that the use of the `thefuck -v` command within Oh-My-Fish triggers a recursive loop due to the faulty behavior of the `info` function.

## Identified potential error location
The potential error location is the `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line. The issue could be related to how the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is being handled, leading to incorrect version extraction.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` operation does not correctly capture the version string, leading to a version mismatch.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command's output is captured and processed correctly to extract the version string. This may involve modifying the way the command is executed and the subsequent handling of the output.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version.split(",")[1].strip()}'
```

In the corrected version, I am using `readline()` instead of `read()` to capture the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. Then, I am processing the version string to extract the specific version number using `split(",")[1]`. This should effectively capture the correct version of the Fish Shell and resolve the issue.
