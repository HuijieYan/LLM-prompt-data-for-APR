Based on the provided information, it seems that the buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish version. The expected version is obtained using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test case is expecting the version with `fish --version`.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version needs to be corrected. Additionally, since the process `proc` is being used, it's essential to ensure proper handling of the process output and any potential errors.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

The corrected function uses the `fish --version` command to retrieve the version of Fish shell as expected by the test case.

With the corrected version as shown above, the `test_info` function should now pass, resolving the issue described on GitHub.
