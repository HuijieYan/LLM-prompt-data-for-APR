## The problem
The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test case is providing an unexpected output which causes the assertion error. The expected output from the command is `fish, version 3.5.9` but the function is returning `Fish Shell 3.5.9`.

## Solution strategy
The fix requires modifying the function to correctly parse the version string from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. We need to extract the version number from the output and format it according to the expected return value.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell ' + version
```
