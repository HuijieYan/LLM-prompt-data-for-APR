## Analysis
The error message and the runtime input/output values indicate that the `info` function is returning the incorrect version string. The expected version string is "Fish Shell 3.5.9", but the actual version string is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

The cause of the bug is that the version string retrieved from the subprocess' stdout is not being formatted correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug in the `info` function can be fixed by modifying the way the version string is being retrieved and formatted.

## Bug Fix
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By splitting the version string based on ", " and taking the second part, we can extract the version number "3.5.9" and format it correctly to match the expected output. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected version string.
