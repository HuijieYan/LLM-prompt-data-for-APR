The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to fetch the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used by `Popen` to fetch the Fish shell version.

Here's a corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
