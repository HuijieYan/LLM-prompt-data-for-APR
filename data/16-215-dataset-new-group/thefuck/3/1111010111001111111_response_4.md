Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class seems to be related to the command used to retrieve the Fish version. The failing test indicates that the expected version is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, but the actual version extracted from the command output is only `'3.5.9'`. This suggests that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not providing the complete version string.

To fix this bug, the command being executed should be modified to retrieve the complete version string that includes the word "fish". The Popen command should be changed to `Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)` to return the complete version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the `info` function will now retrieve the complete version string and return the expected result "Fish Shell 3.5.9" as indicated by the failing test case.

This fix should also resolve the GitHub issue related to the recursive loop triggered by the incomplete version string.
