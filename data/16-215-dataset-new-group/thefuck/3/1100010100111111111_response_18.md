## Analysis
The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell by using the Popen subprocess to run the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'. The retrieved version is then formatted into a string. The failing test indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The expected version to be retrieved from the command should be 'fish, version 3.5.9' as shown in the failing test.

It seems that the output string 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' is being modified instead of the actual version number 'fish, version 3.5.9', causing the assertion to fail.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the retrieved version string. The function is generating the output with a fixed prefix 'Fish Shell' and the full retrieved version string, which causes the assertion to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should extract the actual version number from the retrieved string and then format it as 'Fish Shell <version>'. This will ensure that the correct version is used in the output string.

## The corrected version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```
