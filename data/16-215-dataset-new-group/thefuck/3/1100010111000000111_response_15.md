The issue with the `info()` function in `fish.py` is that it is calling the `fish` command with the `-c` flag to echo the `FISH_VERSION`, and this is inconsistent with the test that is expecting `['fish', '--version']` to be called.

The strategy to fix the bug is to update the `Popen` call to use `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This will align the function with the expectation in the test and resolve the recursion issue outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function in `fish.py`:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info()` function in `fish.py` will correctly return the version of the Fish shell and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
