The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is creating a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This is because the `info` function is using `Popen` to get the Fish shell version, but it is not handling the recursive loop case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to handle the recursive loop case and also to return the correct version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    if version.startswith('fish, version'):
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    else:
        return 'Fish shell version not found'
```
