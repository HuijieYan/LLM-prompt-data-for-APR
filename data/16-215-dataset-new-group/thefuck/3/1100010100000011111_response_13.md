## Analysis
The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command. However, the usage of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` may lead to hanging or recursive loop issues, which is exactly the problem reported in the GitHub issue.

## Error location
The error is in the way the output of the command is being read and processed, possibly causing a hang or recursive loop.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to read the output of the command. This can lead to hanging or recursive loop issues, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the reading of the output from the subprocess in a way that avoids hanging or recursive loops. We can also refactor the code to follow best practices for executing shell commands in Python.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use `proc.communicate()` to read the output of the subprocess, which avoids potential hanging or recursive loop issues. We then decode the output and strip any whitespace before returning the version of the Fish shell. This should resolve the hanging issue reported in the GitHub bug.
