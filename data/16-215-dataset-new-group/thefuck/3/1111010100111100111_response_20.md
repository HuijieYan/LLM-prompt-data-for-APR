### Bug Fix

#### Potential Error Locations
The potential error location is with the `info` function's implementation where it tries to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

#### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect extraction of the fish version from the shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The function reads the output of the subprocess while also including the command itself in the result.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that only the version number of the Fish shell is extracted from the output of the subprocess command and then used to construct the return string format.

#### The Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        bytes_version = proc.stdout.read().strip()
        try:
            version = bytes_version.decode('utf-8').split(',')[1].strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except IndexError:
            return u'Fish Shell [version not found]'
```

This corrected version ensures that the fish version is correctly extracted from the output of the subprocess command and that the return string is constructed with the correct version information.
