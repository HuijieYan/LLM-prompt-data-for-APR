The cause of the bug is that the command used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. The `Popen` command is attempting to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version, but it should be executing `fish --version` instead.

We can fix the bug by modifying the command that is passed to `Popen`, and also not use the `shell=True` parameter. Additionally, we need to fix the test to check for the correct call arguments for `Popen`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```

The corrected test function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tests/shells/test_fish.py

def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.return_value = b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these corrections, the `info` function should now correctly return the version of the Fish shell and the test should pass.
