## Corrected Version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

Explanation:
The original buggy function was calling `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version, but the test was expecting the version to be fetched using `fish --version`. This caused the test to fail as the expected and actual version strings were different.

The corrected version of the function calls `fish --version` to fetch the version and splits the output to get the version number, which aligns with what the test is expecting.

This change in the function will make it match the expected output from the test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
