# The buggy function 'info' is part of the 'Fish' class.

# Potential error locations:
1. Use of Popen without handling exceptions or checking the return code.
2. Returning a Unicode string without ensuring compatibility with Python 2 and 3.

# Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of Popen without handling exceptions or checking the return code. This can result in unexpected behavior if the subprocess fails to execute, and the return value is not checked for errors. Additionally, the use of Unicode string formatting may cause compatibility issues between Python 2 and 3.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use try-except block to handle exceptions when calling Popen.
2. Use communicate() method to get the output and error streams of the subprocess.
3. Use byte strings instead of Unicode strings for compatibility between Python 2 and 3.

# Corrected version of the buggy function 'info':
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error executing subprocess: {e}")
            return "Fish Shell (Error)"
        
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
