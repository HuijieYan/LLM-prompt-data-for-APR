The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly capturing the fish version from the command output. The error message shows that the expected output is "Fish Shell 3.5.9" but the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9". This is because the function is not correctly parsing the output of the command.

To fix this bug, we need to properly parse the output of the command to extract the version number and then format it into the expected output format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the version number from the command output and return it in the expected format. This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
