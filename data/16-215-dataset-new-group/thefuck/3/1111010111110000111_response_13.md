Based on the provided information, the potential error location in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is the command used for Popen. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` returns the version of Fish shell, and there might be a discrepancy with the expected output.

The cause of the bug is related to the command for Popen, which is expected to return the version of Fish shell, but it returns a string in an unexpected format. This causes the assertion to fail in the test function.

To fix the bug, the command for Popen can be changed to `['fish', '--version']` to directly fetch the version information.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[-1])
```

By using `['fish', '--version']` as the command for Popen, the corrected version of the function will directly return the version of the Fish shell, which will resolve the failed assertion in the test function.
