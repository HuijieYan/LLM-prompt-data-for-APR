Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is related to the command used to retrieve the fish version. It indicates a recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command, leading to the need for a fix.

The potential error in the `info` function is the command being used to retrieve the fish version, and the way the output is read and processed.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the fish version is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior and a potential recursive loop issue. This is indicated by the GitHub issue mentioning the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to update the command used to retrieve the fish version and handle the output accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the info function in the Fish class
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command to retrieve the fish version is updated to `['fish', '--version']`, and the output is handled properly. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and allow the function to pass the failing test.
