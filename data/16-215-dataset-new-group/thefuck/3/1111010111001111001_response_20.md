The bug in the code is caused by the incorrect command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command used in the Popen call is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version'. This results in the version variable being assigned the incorrect value, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be updated to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
