The issue with the buggy function is that it's not capturing the correct output for the Fish shell version. It captures only the version number itself, but the expected output includes the prefix "fish, version".

To fix this bug, we need to update the command to include the prefix "fish, version".

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

This updated version of the function includes the correct command to capture the output with the "fish, version" prefix, as expected. This should resolve the bug and provide the expected output.
