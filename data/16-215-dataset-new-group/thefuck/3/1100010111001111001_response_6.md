To fix the buggy function, we need to update the Popen call to include the `--version` flag and modify the parsing of the output to extract the version number correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we update the command passed to Popen to include the `--version` flag. Then, we modify the parsing of the output to extract the version number correctly by splitting the output at the comma and space and taking the second part.

With this corrected version, the test case should pass as expected.
