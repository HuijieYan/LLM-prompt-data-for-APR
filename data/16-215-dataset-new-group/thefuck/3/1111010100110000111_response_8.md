## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, the GitHub issue.

### Buggy Function
The function `info` in the `Fish` class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, which is Fish in this case.

### Corresponding Error Message
The error message indicates that the returned value from the `info` function includes the string `'Fish Shell'` followed by the actual version number. However, the expected value only includes the `'Fish Shell'` followed by the version number without the string `'fish, version'`.

### GitHub Issue
The GitHub issue states that when using the TheFuck plugin with Oh-My-Fish, a recursive loop is triggered due to the `Fish.info()` function. This indicates that the `Fish.info()` function is causing a problem when initializing the Fish shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function
1. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line might be returning the string `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just the version number.
2. The string formatting using `u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` might not be removing the unnecessary `'fish, version'` part from the version.

## Explanation of the Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not properly parsing the output of the command used to retrieve the version of the shell. This results in unnecessary text being included in the returned value, leading to the assertion error.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the way the output of the command is processed and formatted. Specifically, the function should only extract the version number from the output and use it to construct the return value without including any unnecessary text.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version, the `split` method is used to extract the version number from the output, and an f-string is used for string formatting to construct the return value without including any unnecessary text. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
