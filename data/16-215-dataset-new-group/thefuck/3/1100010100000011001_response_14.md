The bug in the provided function is that the `Popen` object is not being properly communicated with to retrieve the output. The `stdout.read()` method is not being called correctly, and the decoding of the output is also not handled properly.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the `Popen` object by using the `communicate()` method to retrieve the output and decode it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly retrieve the version of the fish shell and return it in the correct format.
