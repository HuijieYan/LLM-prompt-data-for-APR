The bug in the `info` function is that it is not properly parsing the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is extracting the version number directly from the stdout of the `Popen` process without properly converting it to the expected format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the version number is extracted and formatted.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected function, the tests should pass and the function should return the expected output.
