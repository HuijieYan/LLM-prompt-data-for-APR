The issue lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not equivalent to 'fish --version', which is the command that should be used.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
