The issue with the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the version of the Fish shell. It is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` while it should be using `fish --version`. This is causing the returned version to be incorrect and failing the test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command used to get the Fish shell version to `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the `info` function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
