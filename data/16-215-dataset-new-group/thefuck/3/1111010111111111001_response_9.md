The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to extract the version number from the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but it should actually be extracting the version from the output of the command 'fish --version'.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to use the correct command to obtain the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
