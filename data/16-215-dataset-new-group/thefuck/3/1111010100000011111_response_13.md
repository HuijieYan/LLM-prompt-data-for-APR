## Analysis
The buggy function `info()` in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current Fish Shell. However, it seems to be encountering a recursive loop issue when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin `thefuck -v` command, as described in the GitHub issue. The function uses `Popen` to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish Shell, but it does not handle the `Popen` process termination correctly, leading to the reported hanging issue.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error lies in how the `Popen` process is handled and the reading of the process output.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not properly handling the termination of the `Popen` process, which results in a hang when the `thefuck -v` command is used.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `Popen` process should be managed properly, and the function should ensure that the process is terminated and all the associated resources are cleaned up after retrieving the version of the Fish Shell.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        with Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL) as proc:
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `Popen` process is wrapped within a `with` statement to ensure that the process is properly terminated and all associated resources are cleaned up after retrieving the version of the Fish Shell. This should resolve the hanging issue when using the `thefuck -v` command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
