The bug in the `info` function is due to the fact that the command being run by Popen is incorrect. The expected command is `['fish', '--version']` but the actual command is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This means that the `version` variable is being assigned the wrong value.

To fix the bug, the command being run by Popen should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
