The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly reading the output of the `Popen` command and formatting it into the correct version string. The error message shows that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', indicating that the function is not correctly parsing the version information from the output of the command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to correctly read and parse the version information from the output of the `Popen` command and format it into the expected version string.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # Get the version number after "version"
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we split the version string to extract the actual version number and format it into 'Fish Shell x.x.x' format. This modification ensures that the correct version information is extracted from the output of the command and returned in the expected format.
