To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function in the `Fish` class to correctly extract the version information from the output of the `fish` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish -v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This updated version uses the `fish -v` command to extract the version information, and it should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub by using the correct command to fetch the version.
