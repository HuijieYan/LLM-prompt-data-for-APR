## Explain the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `info` function in the `fish.py` file is reading the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command and stripping the result to obtain the version. However, the expected version is different from the actual version obtained from the command output.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected version is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual version obtained from the command output is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`. This discrepancy is causing the assertion error.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function in the `fish.py` file so that it correctly extracts the version from the command output and formats it into the expected `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` format.

The corrected version of the `info` function should properly parse the output of the command and extract the version number without any unnecessary text.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
