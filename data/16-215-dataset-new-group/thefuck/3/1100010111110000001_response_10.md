The `info` function in the `fish.py` file is expected to return the name and version of the current shell. The function calls a subprocess using `Popen` to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and retrieves the version from the command output. However, the Popen call specifies the wrong arguments, which causes the function to return the output of the wrong command, leading to a failing test.

The error message indicates that the actual output returned by the buggy function includes the extra prefix "fish, version", causing the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be modified to execute the correct command that retrieves the FISH_VERSION. Then, the function should return the correct version string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct version obtained from the command output.
