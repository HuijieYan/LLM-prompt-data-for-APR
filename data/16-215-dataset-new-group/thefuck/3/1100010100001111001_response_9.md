## The source code for the corrected function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the output string. The expected output includes 'fish, version' followed by the version number, but the buggy function only includes 'Fish Shell' followed by the version number.

To fix the bug, the output string should be formatted as 'fish, version {}'. This will ensure that the output matches the expected value.

The corrected version provided above satisfies the expected input/output values.
