## Correction

The issue seems to be related to the way the version of Fish shell is being retrieved in the `info` function. It appears that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not returning the correct output, leading to the incorrect version being displayed.

To fix this, we can update the command being used to retrieve the version of Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `--version` flag to retrieve the version of Fish shell directly. Then, we extract the version number from the output and return it in the correct format.

With this change, the `info` function should now return the correct version of Fish shell and pass the failing test. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to recursive loop triggering.
