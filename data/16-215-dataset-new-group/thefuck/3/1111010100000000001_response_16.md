## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is part of the class `Fish`, and it is meant to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the `Popen` class from the `subprocess` module to run a command in the shell and capture its output.

## Identification of Potential Error Locations
1. Reading from the `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to finish.
2. Using the `Popen` function without handling the potential errors.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function reads from `proc.stdout` without waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to incomplete or missing output from the shell command. Additionally, the function does not handle potential errors that may occur during the shell command execution.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Use the `proc.communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and capture its output.
2. Add error handling to the `Popen` function to catch and handle any potential errors that may occur during the shell command execution.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error getting shell information: {}".format(str(e))

```

In the corrected version, I have added a `try-except` block to catch any potential errors that may occur during the shell command execution. I have also used the `proc.communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and capture its output. This ensures that the function retrieves the complete output from the shell command and handles any errors that may occur.
