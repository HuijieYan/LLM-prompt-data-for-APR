The issue with the buggy code is that it is not properly capturing the version number from the output of the command used to fetch the Fish shell version. The error message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to capture the Fish shell version is returning more output than just the version number. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command returns 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just '3.5.9'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command to capture only the version number. We can use the `fish --version` command to get the version number directly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path where the corrected function should reside: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract version number from the output
    version_number = version.split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version_number)
```

This corrected version of the function should capture the version number accurately from the output of the `fish --version` command.
