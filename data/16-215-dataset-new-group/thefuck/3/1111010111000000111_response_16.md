The buggy function is the `info` method in the `Fish` class within the `fish.py` file. The function tries to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and retrieving the output. However, the test function `test_info` in the `test_fish.py` file sets the expected output to `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, which differs from what the `info` method is trying to obtain.

The root cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` method is different from what is expected by the `test_info` test function. This causes the `info` method to return an incorrect version number, leading to the failing test and causing a recursive loop in the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, the command passed to `Popen` in the `info` method should be changed to `fish --version` to align with the expected output in the `test_info` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version', '').strip())
```

With this correction, the `info` method will accurately retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and the test function will then be able to correctly assert the version, resolving the issue reported on GitHub. This change ensures that the function and the test are in sync with the expected command output.
