The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, leading to a recursive loop in certain cases. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is incorrect and should be `['fish', '--version']`.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly return the version of the Fish shell without causing any recursive loops. This change will address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and ensure that the tests for the `info` method pass successfully.
