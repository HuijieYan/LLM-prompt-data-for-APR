The buggy function is `info` and it is part of the `Fish` class. This function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, in this case, the Fish shell.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Not checking if the `Popen` command successfully executed or not.
2. Not handling the possibility of an error in the subprocess call.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle potential errors that might occur during the subprocess call, such as the subprocess failing to execute, or encountering an error while running the command.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to use a try-except block to handle the potential errors, and properly handle the subprocess call to ensure it executes successfully.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            if proc.returncode == 0:
                return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
            else:
                return "Error: Failed to retrieve Fish shell version"
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error: " + str(e)
```

In the corrected version, a try-except block is used to catch any potential errors that might occur during the subprocess call. The `proc.communicate()` method is used to read the output of the subprocess, and the `proc.returncode` is checked to verify the successful execution of the subprocess. If an error occurs, an appropriate error message is returned.
