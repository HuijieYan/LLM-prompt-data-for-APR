The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is not handling the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command correctly. The failing test is indicating that the function is returning the wrong version string.

The cause of the bug is that the function is expecting the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command to be just the version number, but the actual output includes the text "fish, version" in addition to the version number. This results in the incorrect version string being returned by the function.

To fix this bug, the function needs to parse the output of the command and extract the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(", version ")[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This function reads the output of the command, splits it by the ", version " string, and extracts the version number from the second part of the split. This corrected version should now return the expected version string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
