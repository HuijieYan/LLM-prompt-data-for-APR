The cause of the bug is that the Popen call is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' as the command to get the version, but the test is expecting the version to be obtained using 'fish --version'. 
To fix the bug, the command in the Popen call should be changed to 'fish --version' to align with the test expectation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version', the corrected function now aligns with the test expectation and should pass the failing test.
