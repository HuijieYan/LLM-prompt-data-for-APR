### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `info` function of the `fish.py` file. When the function is called with the command `thefuck -v`, it triggers a recursive loop that causes the program to hang. This is because the function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the subprocess module. However, when the `thefuck -v` command is executed, it triggers the `info` function, leading to a recursive loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function so that it does not trigger a recursive loop when called with the `thefuck -v` command. One way to do this is to check if the `thefuck -v` command is being executed and return a default value instead of trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv:
        return u'Fish Shell version unknown'
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
