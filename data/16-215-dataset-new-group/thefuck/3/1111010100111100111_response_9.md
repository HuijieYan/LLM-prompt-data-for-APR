The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class arises from the fact that it is returning the complete version string, including the shell name and version number, without properly parsing the version number.

The issue is that the function is returning "Fish Shell 3.5.9" instead of "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly parse the version number and return it in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

        # Parse the version number and return it in the proper format
        return 'Fish Shell ' + version.split(' ')[-1]
```
