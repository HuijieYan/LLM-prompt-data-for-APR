## Fixing the bug

The bug in the `info` function is that it's not running the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` call is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`. This is why the test is failing when it checks the `Popen.call_args[0][0]` value.

To fix this bug, we need to change the command being run by `Popen` to `fish --version`.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
