The `info` function in the `Fish` class is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, but due to the implementation using `Popen` to run a command in the shell, it fails to extract the correct version information from the output and instead returns the wrong version format.

The first potential error location in the `info` function is with the command argument for Popen. The command should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This is causing the incorrect version information to be returned.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect command being used to get the version of the Fish shell through the Popen function, resulting in the incorrect version output and subsequently failing the test.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` in order to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and update the returned version format accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```
