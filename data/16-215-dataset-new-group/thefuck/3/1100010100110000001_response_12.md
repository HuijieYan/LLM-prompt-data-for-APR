Based on the error message, the bug in the function seems to be related to the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` being 'Fish, version 3.5.9', but it should be '3.5.9'. 

The cause of the bug is how the version string is extracted from the output of the command. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command returns 'fish, version 3.5.9\n', and the buggy function does not correctly extract the version number from this output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we handle the output of the command to extract only the version number and then format it as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()  # original buggy line
    version = version.split(', version ')[1]  # extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly extract the version number from the command output and format it as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', which will pass the failing test.
