The bug occurs in the `info` function of the `Fish` class, where it is attempting to extract the version number of the Fish Shell. However, the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` within `Popen` returns "fish, version 3.5.9" rather than just the version number "3.5.9". This results in the assertion failure when comparing the expected output "Fish Shell 3.5.9" with the actual output "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".

To fix the bug, the function should extract only the version number from the output of the `Popen` command before creating the "Fish Shell" string.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The fix ensures that the `Popen` command retrieves the version information directly by using the `--version` flag, and then extracts only the version number from the output before returning the formatted string "Fish Shell" followed by the version. This corrected version will satisfy the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue posted related to the bug.
