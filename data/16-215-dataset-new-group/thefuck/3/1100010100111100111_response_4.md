### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and then reading the output. However, the function currently returns the entire output string including the command and the word "version", leading to the incorrect output and the failing test.

The failing test provides the expected output as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output from the function is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

### Bug Location
The cause of the bug is within the line:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
This line incorrectly retrieves the entire output string, leading to the mismatch with the expected value.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by retrieving the entire output string from the command execution, including the command itself and the word "version", instead of just the version number.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output string and then return the correct format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[-1]  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the variable `output` is used to store the entire output string, and then the version number is extracted using `split(' ')` and `-1` to obtain the last part of the string. This ensures that only the version number is included in the final return value.
