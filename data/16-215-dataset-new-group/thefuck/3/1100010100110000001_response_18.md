## Analysis
The error message indicates that the returned version string includes extra information that needs to be removed. It seems the buggy function is not correctly extracting the version from the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue seems to be with the way the version is being retrieved and formatted. It's likely that the version string includes additional information that is not required.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the command output when retrieving the version information. The version is extracted and formatted incorrectly, leading to additional information being included in the final output, causing the assertion to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the version is extracted correctly from the command output and that any additional information is trimmed. We should also verify that the extracted version matches the expected format.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_bytes = proc.stdout.read().strip()
    version = version_bytes.decode('utf-8').split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are first decoding the received bytes to string and then splitting it by space. We then use the last element of the split to ensure that only the version number is returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
