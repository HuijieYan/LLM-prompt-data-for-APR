The bug in the `info` function is that the command to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, leading to the incorrect version being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and ensure that the correct version is returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[2])
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `--version` flag to retrieve the Fish shell version and then extracting the version number from the output. This should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
