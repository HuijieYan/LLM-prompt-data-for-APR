The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the incorrect command to get the fish shell version. The command should be ['fish', '--version'] instead of ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'].

The cause of the bug is that the incorrect command is being used to retrieve the fish shell version, resulting in the function always returning 'Fish Shell '. This is because the version variable is not being set correctly due to the incorrect command.

To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the fish shell version should be used. Changing the command to ['fish', '--version'] will ensure that the correct version is retrieved.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
