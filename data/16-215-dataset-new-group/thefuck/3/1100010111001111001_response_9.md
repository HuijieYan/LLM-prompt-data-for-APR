## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
The original function is calling the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of the fish shell, but the test is expecting the command 'fish --version' to be called. This mismatch is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command executed by Popen to 'fish --version'.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
