## Explanation
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing a command using `Popen` and capturing the output. However, the function is not properly handling the process output and therefore not returning the correct version of the shell. Additionally, this buggy code is causing a recursive loop issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly capture the output of the `Popen` process and then return the correct shell version. We also need to ensure that the function does not cause a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    proc.stdout.close()  # Close the stdout pipe to prevent recursive calls
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected function, we properly close the stdout pipe after reading the output to prevent recursive calls. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and return the correct version of the Fish shell.
