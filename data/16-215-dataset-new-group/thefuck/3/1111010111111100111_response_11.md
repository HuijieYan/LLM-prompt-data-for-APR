The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is not fetching the correct version information from the shell. The test is failing because the expected version string is not matching the actual value returned by the function.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the `Popen` call is not correctly fetching the Fish shell version, and as a result, the function is returning an incorrect version string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command passed to `Popen` to correctly fetch the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

In this corrected version, we are using `['fish', '--version']` to fetch the version and then parsing the output to correctly obtain the version string. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected version string.
