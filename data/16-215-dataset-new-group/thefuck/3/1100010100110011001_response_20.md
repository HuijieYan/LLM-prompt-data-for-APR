The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect parsing of the version output from the `fish` command. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is returning the entire output string "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just the version number "3.5.9".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version number from the output of the `fish` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_output.split(", ")[1]  # extract the version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This will correctly extract the version number from the output of the `fish` command and return the expected result.
