## Analysis
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. The potential error locations are the subprocess call and reading the output from the process. The cause of the bug is likely due to not handling the subprocess output and errors properly. 

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the current code is that while the subprocess command is launched correctly, the output is not read correctly and errors are not handled properly. The `proc.stdout.read()` call does not guarantee that it will read the entire output of the command, and errors from the subprocess are not being captured.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the subprocess output and errors by using the `communicate` function to read the entire output and handle any errors that occur during the process. We also need to handle the case where `FISH_VERSION` environment variable is not defined.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        output, error = proc.communicate()
        if proc.returncode != 0:
            return "Error executing command"
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip() if output else "Unknown"
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
