The issue with the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` command is running `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version` to retrieve the version information, which leads to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be updated to use the correct command `['fish', '--version']` to obtain the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
