The buggy function is `info()` inside the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The `info()` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. However, the `Popen` call is using the wrong command to get the version (`['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']`) and is reading from `stdout` without waiting for the process to finish.

The failing test `test_info` sets up the `Popen` mock to return a specific version string when the `info()` method is called, and then checks if the return value from `info()` matches the expected version and if the correct command was used with `Popen`.

The GitHub issue describes how the `thefuck -v` command in the Oh-My-Fish plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the bug in the `info()` function.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call should be modified to use `['fish', '--version']` command, and the output should be captured after waiting for the process to finish.

Here's the corrected version of the `info()` function:
```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
With this correction, the `info()` function should return the correct version of the Fish shell using the `--version` command and handle the output from the process correctly.
