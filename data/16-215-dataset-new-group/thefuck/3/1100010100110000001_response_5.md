## Analysis
The error message indicates an AssertionError. It seems that the version string obtained from the command does not match the expected format.

## Bugs locations
1. When using `echo $FISH_VERSION` it returns `fish, version 3.5.9` instead of just the version number.

## Cause of the bug
The shell command `echo $FISH_VERSION` returns the version number along with the "fish, version" prefix, which causes the version to be stored in the `version` variable in an incorrect format.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
Modify the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command to remove the "fish, version" prefix, so that only the version number is obtained.

## The corrected version

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION | cut -d " " -f 3'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
