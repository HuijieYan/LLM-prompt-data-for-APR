The issue with the `info` function in the `Fish` class is that it is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of using `fish --version`. Additionally, the assertion in the test is expecting the call to `Popen` to have the arguments `['fish', '--version']` which is not the case in the buggy function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `info` function to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version (`fish --version`) and update the assertion in the test to reflect the correct call to `Popen`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function and the test:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

```python
# The corrected version of the failing test
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these corrections, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and the test should pass.
