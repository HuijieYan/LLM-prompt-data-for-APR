The cause of the bug in this function is that the command being used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen command to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version, the test should pass as it now correctly retrieves the Fish shell version using the `--version` command instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` for the Popen command.
