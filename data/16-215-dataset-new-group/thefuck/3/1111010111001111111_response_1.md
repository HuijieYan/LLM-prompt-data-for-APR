The bug in the `info` function of the `Fish` class is causing the failing test. The function is expected to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using `echo $FISH_VERSION` but is instead calling `['fish', '--version']`. This results in the incorrect version being retrieved and the test failing.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` call needs to be updated to use `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `['fish', '--version']`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, and the failing test should pass. This fix also addresses the GitHub issue related to the hanging of Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
