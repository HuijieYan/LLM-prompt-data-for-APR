The bug in the provided code is that the output from the Popen command is not being decoded correctly, resulting in an unexpected version string.

The cause of the bug is that the `stdout.read()` method returns a byte string, which needs to be properly decoded using the `decode('utf-8')` method.

To fix the bug, we need to properly decode the output of the Popen command and format it into the expected version string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly decode the shell version and return the expected version string.
