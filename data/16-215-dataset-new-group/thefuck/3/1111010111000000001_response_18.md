The potential issue with the `info` function is that it is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to obtain the version of the Fish shell. However, in the failing test, the expected command is `fish --version`. This means that the command used to obtain the version of the shell in the `info` function does not match the expected command in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command used in the `Popen` call to match the expected command in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

In the corrected version, the `Popen` call uses the command `fish --version` to obtain the version of the Fish shell, which matches the expected command in the failing test.

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
