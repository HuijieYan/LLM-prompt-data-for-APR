Bug location:
The bug is located in the `info` function of the `Fish` class.

Cause of the bug:
The `info` function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. However, the command `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop because of the way the `info` function is implemented.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the command being executed in the `info` function to properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop.

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, universal_newlines=True)
        version = proc.stdout.read().strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we modify the command to `['fish', '-v']` to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. We also set `stderr=PIPE` and `universal_newlines=True` to handle any errors and ensure proper decoding of the output. This should resolve the recursive loop issue and return the expected version string.
