The bug in the `info` function is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `subprocess.Popen` class. The `Popen` class is being created with the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, and the output is being read from the `proc.stdout` attribute. However, the `Popen` class should be managed properly to ensure that the subprocess is opened and closed correctly, and its output is read in a safe manner.

To fix the bug, we should use the context manager `subprocess.run` instead of `Popen` to ensure that the subprocess is closed properly. This will also simplify the code.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        result = subprocess.run(['echo', '$FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True, universal_newlines=True)
        version = result.stdout.strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
With the use of `subprocess.run`, the subprocess is managed properly, and the output can be read safely without needing to manage the subprocess manually. This should fix the bug in the `info` function.
