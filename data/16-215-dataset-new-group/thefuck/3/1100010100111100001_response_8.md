The issue in the buggy function is that it is returning the entire string returned by the shell command, including the text "fish, version". This is causing the assertion error in the test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to extract only the version number from the output of the shell command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]  # Extracting only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should now correctly return the version number without the extra text. This should make the test pass.
