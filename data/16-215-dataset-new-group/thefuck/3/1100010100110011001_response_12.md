The buggy function `info` is expected to return the name and version of the current shell. However, when the failing test case is executed, it fails with an assertion error because the returned value includes unwanted characters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Instead of just the version number, the entire output including the prefix "fish, version" is being included in the returned value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to extract only the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will extract only the version number from the output of the command and return it as expected. This should make the failing test pass.
