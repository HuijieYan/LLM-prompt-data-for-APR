The buggy function "info" in the "Fish" class has a few issues:
1. It is using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" instead of "fish --version" to get the version of the Fish shell.
2. The test is setting the side_effect for Popen.return_value.stdout.read which is not the correct attribute to set.

The cause of the bug is that the "info" function is not fetching the Fish shell's version correctly and it is not handling the Popen correctly as per the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used in Popen to fetch the Fish shell version and also update the test to set the correct side_effect attribute for Popen.return_value.stdout.read.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

The corrected version of the test function:
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.return_value = b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly fetch the Fish shell's version and the test should pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
