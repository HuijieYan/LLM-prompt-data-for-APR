The bug in the given function is that it is not correctly reading the output from the process created by Popen.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to read from proc.stdout directly, but it should be using proc.communicate() to read the output of the process.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function should be as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the proc.communicate() method, we can correctly read the output of the process and return the version of the Fish shell.
