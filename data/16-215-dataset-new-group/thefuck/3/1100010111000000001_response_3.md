The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, the command being executed is incorrect, and there is a mismatch between the command being executed and the expected output in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed should be `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. Additionally, the test is expecting the version number in the format `3.5.9` which does not match the output of the `echo` command.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to execute the correct command and format the output to match the expected version number in the test.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction uses the command `fish --version` to get the version of the Fish shell and then formats the version number to match the expected output in the failing test.

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
