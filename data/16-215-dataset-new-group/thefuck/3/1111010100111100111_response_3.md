The issue in the buggy code is caused by the fact that the `info` function is not properly extracting the version number from the output of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. This causes the assertion in the failing test to fail because the actual output of the function does not match the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is not properly extracting the version number from the output obtained from the `Popen` call.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly extract the version number from the output obtained from the `Popen` call and format it correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(", version ")[1]  # Extract version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function will properly extract and format the version number, fixing the bug and addressing the failing test.
