The bug in the given function is that it is not properly reading the output from the `Popen` process. 

The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not the correct way to read the output. It should use `communicate()` to properly read the output from the process.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version properly retrieves the `FISH_VERSION` from the `fish` shell and returns it as expected.
