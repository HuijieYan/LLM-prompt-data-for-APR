The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to retrieve the fish version. This results in the function not returning the correct version of the fish shell.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the fish version in the `info` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `Popen` command now uses `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the fish version, which matches the expected input/output values for the failing test.

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
