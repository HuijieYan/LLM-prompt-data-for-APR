The issue in the buggy function is that it's not correctly parsing the version string returned by the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The version string includes the word "fish," which is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse and format the version string returned by the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(", version ")[1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function will correctly parse the version string and return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as per the failing test.
