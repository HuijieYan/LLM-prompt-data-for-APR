The bug in the `info` function is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` does not correctly return the Fish shell version.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command to `['fish', '--version']` to properly retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This updated version of the function correctly runs the command `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the Fish shell version, and it also extracts the version from the output to return the expected result.

With this update, the function should pass the failing test.
