The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the output string. The function is returning 'Fish Shell' followed by the entire output string from the command, including the 'fish, version' part. This results in the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should only extract the version number from the output of the command and format the output string accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will extract only the version number from the output and return the formatted string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', which will pass the failing test.
