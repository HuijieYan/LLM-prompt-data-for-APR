### Bug explanation
The bug in the `info` function is that it is not capturing the full version information of the Fish shell. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` only returns the version number, but the expected return value includes the string "fish, version" followed by the version number.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the command being run by Popen to include the "fish, version" string and modify the extraction of the version number accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo "fish, version $FISH_VERSION"'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()[13:]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
