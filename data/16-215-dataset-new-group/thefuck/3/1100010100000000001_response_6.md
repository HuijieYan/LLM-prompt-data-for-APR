The potential error locations within the buggy function are the Popen subprocess call and the reading of the stdout.

The cause of the bug is that the stdout is being read without waiting for the process to finish, which may result in an empty string or incomplete data being read.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate()` method to wait for the process to finish and then read the stdout.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `communicate()` method is used to wait for the process to finish and then retrieve the stdout. This ensures that the version is read correctly without any potential errors.
