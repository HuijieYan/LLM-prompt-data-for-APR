The bug in the `info` function is caused by calling `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish, which results in getting an outdated version of the Fish shell. The correct version of the shell version only appears in the last line of the output, because `echo $FISH_VERSION` returns the entire version string including the label "fish, version".


To fix this bug, we need to wait for the process to finish and only return the last line of the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip().split(", ")
    return f"Fish Shell {version[-1]}"
```

With this correction, the `info` function will correctly display the version of the Fish shell without any leading text. This will pass the failing test and address the bug.
