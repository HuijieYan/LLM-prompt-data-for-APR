The issue with the buggy function seems to be with the command used to get the version of the fish shell. The `Popen` command is calling `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version, but the actual output is not just the version number, it includes additional text like "fish, version". 

To fix this bug, the command needs to be changed to `fish --version` to get only the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
This corrected version should address the issue and produce the expected output, passing the failing test.
