The bug in the `info` function is that it returns the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command without parsing the output correctly. This results in the output including the literal "fish, version" string which is not expected.

To fix the bug, the output of the command needs to be properly parsed to extract the version number.

The corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version ', '').split("\n")[0]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version of the function will correctly extract the version number from the command output and return the expected result, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
