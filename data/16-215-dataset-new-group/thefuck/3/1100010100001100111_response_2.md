### Potential error location
The potential error in the buggy function is the `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` line, where it reads from the stdout of the Popen process.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to a recursive loop and hang the Fish shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
Modify the function to wait for the process to finish before reading the stdout. This will prevent the recursive loop and resolve the issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    proc.wait()  # Wait for the process to finish
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
