The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing the output. However, there are potential error locations within the function:

1. The `Popen` call may not capture the complete output if the process execution is slow or if there is a large amount of output.
2. Using `proc.stdout.read()` directly might cause the program to hang if the process does not terminate or if there is a large amount of output.

The bug in the function is likely caused by not handling the subprocess communication properly, which can lead to incomplete output capture and possible program hangs.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to use the `communicate()` method of the `proc` object to properly handle the subprocess communication and prevent potential hangs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
