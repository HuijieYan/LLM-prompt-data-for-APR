The buggy function `info` in the file `fish.py` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command using `Popen`. The function then formats the version into a string and returns it. 

The failing test indicates that the assert statement is comparing the actual output `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` with the expected output `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the function is not correctly parsing the version from the command output.

The cause of the bug is likely in the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This line is attempting to read the output and decode it, but it seems to be including the word "fish," in the retrieved version. This is likely due to the way the command output is being processed.

To fix this bug, we should modify the line that retrieves the version from the command output. We can use the `split` method to split the output by whitespace and take the last element, which should be the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected version should properly extract the version number from the command output and return the expected result, resolving the failing test and the issue mentioned in GitHub.
