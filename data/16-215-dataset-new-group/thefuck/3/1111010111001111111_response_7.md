To fix the buggy function "info" in the "Fish" class, we need to update the command passed to Popen and adjust the method to properly extract the version from the output. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version_line = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version_line.split()[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Explanation:
- The original function was using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" to get the Fish shell version, which does not work as intended.
- The corrected function updates the command to "fish --version", which properly retrieves the version information.
- The output of the command is read, stripped of whitespace, and then split to extract the version from the output.
- By making these changes, the corrected function should now return the correct version information, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.

With this correction, the function "info" in the "Fish" class should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue.
