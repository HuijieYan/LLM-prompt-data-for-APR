The issue with the `info` function is that it is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` using the `Popen` function. However, the test is expecting the command `fish --version` to be used instead. This mismatch in the command being executed causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command being passed to the `Popen` function to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This will ensure that the correct version of the Fish shell is retrieved and compared with the expected value in the test.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now pass the failing test.
