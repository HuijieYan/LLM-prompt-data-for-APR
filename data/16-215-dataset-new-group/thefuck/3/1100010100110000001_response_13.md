## Analysis
The error message indicates that the actual output from the `shell.info()` function is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`, while the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. This implies that the current implementation is not extracting the version number correctly from the output.

## Error Location
The potential error location is where the `version` is extracted from the output of the command.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by not splitting the output to correctly extract the version number. The function is returning the entire output including the word 'fish' and the version number.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to split the output correctly to extract only the version number (e.g., '3.5.9').

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Split and extract the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
