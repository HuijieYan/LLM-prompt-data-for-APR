The buggy function is the `info` method inside the `Fish` class, which is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. It uses the `Popen` class to execute a command that retrieves the Fish shell version.

The potential error in the buggy function is the way it retrieves the version using the `Popen` class.

The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is not providing the expected output. This is causing the function to return an incorrect value. The GitHub issue indicates that the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop due to the buggy function.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version should be modified to correctly output the Fish shell version. Additionally, the code should be updated to avoid the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['echo', 'fish, version $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, the `Popen` class is used to execute the command `echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `communicate` method is then used to receive the output from the command. The `shell` parameter is set to `True` to allow the use of shell commands.

This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub by correctly retrieving the Fish shell version and preventing the recursive loop triggered by the `thefuck -v` command.
