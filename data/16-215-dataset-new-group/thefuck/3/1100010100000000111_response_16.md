## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `info` in the `shells/fish.py` file is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using the `Popen` function. The GitHub issue indicates that the usage of the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop, causing the Fish shell initialization to hang.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error location is with the usage of `thefuck -v` calling the `info` function, which then triggers a recursive loop because it calls `thefuck -v`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the GitHub Issue information

The cause of the bug is the recursive loop triggered by the `info` function when `thefuck -v` is called, leading to the initialization hang in the Fish shell.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to avoid being called recursively when `thefuck -v` is invoked.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if 'THEFUCK_MODE' in os.environ and os.environ['THEFUCK_MODE'] == 'v':
        return u'Fish Shell'
    
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we check if `THEFUCK_MODE` is set to 'v', and if it is, we return the name of the current shell without getting the version. This prevents the recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is called.
