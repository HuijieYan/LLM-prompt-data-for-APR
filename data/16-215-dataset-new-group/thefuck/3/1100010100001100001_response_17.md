The bug in the provided function is likely due to the usage of a MagicMock object instead of the actual subprocess Popen object. This is evident from the runtime values and types of variables, where the `proc` and `proc.stdout` variables are represented as MagicMock objects.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `Popen` function is properly called with the correct arguments and that the `stdout` is properly read from the subprocess.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read the data from `stdout`, and then decode the result to get the version of the Fish Shell. This ensures that the actual subprocess is used, and the correct output is obtained.
