To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:

1. The command used to retrieve the Fish shell version is incorrect.
2. The handling of the version string read from the process output is not correct.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version and properly process the version string that is read from the process output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

In the corrected version:
- The command to retrieve the Fish shell version has been changed to `['fish', '--version']`.
- The version string is properly processed using `version.split(', version ')[1]` to extract the version number.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
