The issue with the buggy function is that it is not parsing the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command correctly. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'fish, version 3.5.9' due to the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we extract the version information from the command output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding the line `version = version.split(',')[1].strip()`, we split the output by "," and take the second part which contains the version number. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
