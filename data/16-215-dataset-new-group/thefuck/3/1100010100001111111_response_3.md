## Fix the bug
The issue is caused by the function `info` returning the wrong version string. It should return `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the way the version string is formatted.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```
