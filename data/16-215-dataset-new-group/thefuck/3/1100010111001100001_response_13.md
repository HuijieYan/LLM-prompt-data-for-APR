The issue in the `info` function is that the command being executed to get the version of the fish shell is incorrect, and the value returned by the Popen process is not being processed correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the command being executed is `echo $FISH_VERSION` instead of `fish --version`, and the function is not correctly reading the output of the Popen process to get the version.

To fix the bug, the command being executed should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`. Additionally, the function should correctly read and decode the output of the Popen process to extract the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(" ")[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly return the version of the fish shell and pass the failing test.
