The issue with the buggy function is that it is not running the command 'fish --version' to obtain the version number. Instead, it is running 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which is not the correct way to retrieve the Fish shell version.

The failing test is detecting this issue, as the expected version is '3.5.9', but the function is returning 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to run the command 'fish --version' and retrieve the output as the version number.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly retrieve the Fish shell version and pass the failing test.
