The issue in the buggy function is with the way it is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. It uses the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' assuming that it will return the version number, but it actually returns the name of the shell as well. This causes the discrepancy in the comparison and the assertion fails.

To fix the bug, the command to retrieve the version should be modified to only return the version number without the extra information.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting only the version from the returned string
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will extract the version number from the output of the command, and the assertion in the test will pass without error.
