The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the wrong command to get the fish shell version, and it is not handling the output correctly. The test is failing because it expects the version number to be extracted from the output of the command, but the function is returning the entire output instead.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct command to get the fish shell version.
2. Properly read and decode the output of the command to extract the version number.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing test and return the correct version number.
