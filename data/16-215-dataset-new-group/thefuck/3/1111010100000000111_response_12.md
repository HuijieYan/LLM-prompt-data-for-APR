## Analysis and identification of potential errors:

The buggy function `info` is making a call to `Popen` which opens a pipe to or from the child process. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the usage of `thefuck -v` is causing a recursive loop, which may be related to how the output of the `Popen` call is being handled. 

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is likely that the `Popen` call is not being handled properly, leading to a recursive loop when `thefuck -v` is used.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `Popen` call to avoid triggering a recursive loop when using `thefuck -v` with the Fish shell.


## Corrected version:
```python
class Fish(Generic):


    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate()` method of the `proc` object to read data from stdout and stderr, and then decode and strip the output to get the version of the Fish shell. This should resolve the issue of triggering a recursive loop when using `thefuck -v` with the Fish shell.
