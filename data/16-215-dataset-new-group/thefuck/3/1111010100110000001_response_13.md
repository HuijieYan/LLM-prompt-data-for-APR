The buggy function `info` in the class `Fish` is designed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it's not working correctly. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning the incorrect shell version and failing to match the expected output.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line that reads the version from the shell.

The cause of the bug is related to how the output of the `Popen` command is being read and processed. It seems that the function is not correctly parsing the version information from the output.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to capture the output of the command and then parse the version number from it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

Using the `communicate()` method ensures that the output of the command is captured correctly, and then parsing the version from the output resolves the bug that caused the incorrect version to be returned. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
