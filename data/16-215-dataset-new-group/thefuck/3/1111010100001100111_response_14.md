The problem with the original function `info` is that it creates a recursive loop in the Fish shell when the `thefuck -v` command is used, due to the way it retrieves the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` call with the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` triggers the recursive loop.

To fix this bug, we should modify the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved to avoid triggering the recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = 'unknown'  # Default value in case of failure
        try:
            with open(os.path.expanduser('~/.config/fish/config.fish'), 'r') as f:
                for line in f:
                    if line.startswith('set -x FISH_VERSION'):
                        version = line.split(None, 3)[3].strip()
                        break
        except IOError:
            pass
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, we are directly reading the configuration file of the Fish shell to retrieve the version, which avoids triggering the recursive loop. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and prevents the recursive loop when using the `thefuck -v` command in the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
