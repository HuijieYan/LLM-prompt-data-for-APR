The bug in the given function is that it is trying to extract the version from the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' using the 'fish' command. However, in the failing test, the expected version is '3.5.9' but the actual version extracted from the command output is 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command to extract the version from the correct source.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected function, we are using the command 'fish --version' to get the version of the fish shell and then parsing the output to extract the version number. This will ensure that the correct version is obtained and the failing test will pass.
