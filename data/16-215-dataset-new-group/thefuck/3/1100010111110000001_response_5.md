The bug in the `info` function appears to be caused by the incorrect use of the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version of the current shell. The test case `test_info` fails because the returned string from the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command includes more than just the version number.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command used to fetch the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. We should update the command from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version` in order to properly obtain the version number only.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function in the `fish.py` file:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[2])
```

This corrected version uses the `fish --version` command to obtain the version number only, and then extracts the third element from the split result to get the version. This modification should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
