## Analysis:
The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. The output of this command is then used to format and return the shell name and version. However, the usage of this command is causing a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Potential Error Locations:
The recursive loop is likely caused by the usage of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a call to the `info` function, resulting in an infinite loop.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `info` function being called when using the TheFuck plugin, which triggers a recursive loop due to the command being executed within the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
One potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `info` function to have a conditional check to avoid executing the problematic command when using the TheFuck plugin. This check can prevent the recursive loop from occurring.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if not self.is_thefuck_plugin():
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        else:
            return u'Fish Shell'

    def is_thefuck_plugin(self):
        """Check if TheFuck plugin is being used"""
        # Add logic to determine if TheFuck plugin is being used
        return # Logic to check if TheFuck plugin is being used
```
In the corrected version, the `info` function now includes a conditional check to determine if the TheFuck plugin is being used. If the plugin is detected, the function returns a generic message without executing the problematic command. Otherwise, it executes the command as before to get the shell name and version. Additionally, a new `is_thefuck_plugin` method is added to determine if the TheFuck plugin is being used. The specific logic for this check would need to be implemented based on the usage of the plugin.
