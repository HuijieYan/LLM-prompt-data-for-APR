The bug is located in the info method of the Fish class. The line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not correctly extracting the version from the output of the fish shell command `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

The cause of the bug is that the shell is returning the output in a different format than expected, resulting in a mismatch when trying to construct the version string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command given to Popen to correctly retrieve the fish shell version and construct the version string accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the info method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

The fix involves changing the command passed to Popen from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`, and then parsing the version from the output by splitting on `', version '`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
