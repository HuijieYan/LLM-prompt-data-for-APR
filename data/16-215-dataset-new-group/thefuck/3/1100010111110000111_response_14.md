## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(" ")[2])
```

Explanation:
The original function was using the incorrect command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the Fish Shell version. Additionally, the test function was asserting the incorrect command being passed to Popen. The correct command should be 'fish --version' to get the version of the Fish Shell. Additionally, the version should be extracted from the output of the command and formatted correctly using split and indexing.

By using the correct command and extracting the version from the output, the corrected function will now return the accurate version of the Fish Shell and pass the failing test.

This change resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post by using the correct command and extracting the version from the output.
