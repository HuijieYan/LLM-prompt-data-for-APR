There are several issues with the buggy function "info":
1. The command to get the fish version is incorrect ('echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version').
2. The assertion in the failing test is expecting the version string to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but it's actually 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
3. The function is not using the mock Popen object provided in the test.

To fix the issues, the following changes need to be made:
1. Change the command to get the fish version to ['fish', '--version'].
2. Use the provided Popen mock object in the function.
3. Strip the unnecessary text 'fish, version ' from the version string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test and return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
