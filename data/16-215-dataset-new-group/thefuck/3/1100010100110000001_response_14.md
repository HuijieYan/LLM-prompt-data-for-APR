The buggy function is trying to find the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. However, it is not correctly processing the command output and the expected version. 

The cause of the bug is that the output of the command is not being properly processed in the function. The function is using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` to read the output, but it is not correctly extracting the version from the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the command output is processed and the version is extracted from it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract the version from the output
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip().split(' ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, after reading the output, we split the output using the comma as the separator, then strip the leading and trailing white spaces. After that, we further split the string using space as the separator and select the second element to extract the version.
