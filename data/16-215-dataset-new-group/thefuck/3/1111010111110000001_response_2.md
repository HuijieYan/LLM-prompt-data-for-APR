The initial bug is present within the `info` function of the `Fish` class. This function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell but it is currently calling the subprocess with an incorrect command to obtain the version. The failing test aims to verify that the function returns the correct version, but it fails because it's expecting the version information in a different format.

It appears that the bug originates from the incorrect subprocess call to obtain the version of the Fish shell. The subprocess call is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but the correct command should be `fish --version`. This is the main cause of the bug, as the result of `echo $FISH_VERSION` command is not in the expected format.

To fix the bug, I will modify the subprocess call within the `info` function to use the correct command to obtain the version of Fish shell.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

With the corrected version of the function, the command to obtain the version of Fish shell is correctly set to `fish --version` and the returned version value is properly formatted to match the expected output in the failing test. This should ensure that the failing test will now pass.
