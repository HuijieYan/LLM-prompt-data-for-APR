## Analysis
The error message indicates that the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This suggests that the function is not correctly extracting the version number from the command output.

The function uses the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the Fish shell version. However, it seems that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is returning the additional text "fish, version" along with the version number.

## Bug Cause
The `info` function is not correctly extracting the version number from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. It is returning the entire output, including the additional text "fish, version".

## Fix Strategy
We need to modify the function to correctly extract only the version number from the output of the command.

## The corrected function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Extract only the version number by splitting the output
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
