The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly capturing the version of the Fish shell due to the incorrect command being executed. The error message shows that the actual output of the `shell.info()` function contains the unwanted output "fish, version" instead of just the version number "3.5.9". This is due to the incorrect command being passed to the `Popen` function, resulting in the additional "fish, version" in the output.

To fix the bug, the correct command to obtain the version of the Fish shell should be used. Then, the obtained version number should be formatted into the desired output format. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command `['fish', '-v']` is used to obtain the version information directly. Then, the obtained version is properly formatted as 'Fish Shell <version>'. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
