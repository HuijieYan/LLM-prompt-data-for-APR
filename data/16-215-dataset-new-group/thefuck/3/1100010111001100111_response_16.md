### Bug Cause:
The `info` function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using the `Popen` function. However, the test is failing because the function is not executing the correct command. The test is expecting the command `['fish', '--version']` to be executed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the command executed by the `Popen` function inside the `info` function to `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By updating the command in the `info` function, it will now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
