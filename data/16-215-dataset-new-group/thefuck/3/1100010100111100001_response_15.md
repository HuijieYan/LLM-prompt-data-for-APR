The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the string "fish, version" is included in the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' and is not being properly handled in the function. This is causing the assertion to fail because the function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to remove the 'fish, version' substring from the `version` variable before returning the formatted string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, version', '').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix will remove the 'fish, version' substring from the `version` variable and return the correct formatted string, passing the failing test.
