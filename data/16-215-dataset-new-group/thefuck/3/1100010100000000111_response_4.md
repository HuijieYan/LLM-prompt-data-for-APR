## Analysis
The buggy function is `info` in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by invoking the `fish` command and retrieving the output. However, there seems to be an issue with the way the command is being run, causing it to hang and trigger a recursive loop.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The Popen call to execute the `fish` command.
2. Reading the output from the process.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the way the `Popen` command is being used to execute the `fish` command. It's likely that the command is not being executed correctly, leading to the hang and recursive loop.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix should involve checking the way the `Popen` command is used to execute the `fish` command and making sure the output is read properly. It's also important to consider any environment variables that might be affecting the execution of the `fish` command.

## Corrected Version
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
    
    # Check for any errors in stderr
    if proc.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError('Failed to retrieve Fish Shell version')
    
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
