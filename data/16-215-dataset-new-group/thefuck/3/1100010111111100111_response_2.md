## Correction:

The problem with the original function is that it's trying to retrieve the version of Fish shell by executing the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command, which does not give back the correct version string.

The correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version is `fish --version`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version_string = version.split(',')[-1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version_string}'
```

This function uses the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and processes the output to extract the version string. It should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
