The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly fetching the Fish shell version from the command output. The Popen command is using the incorrect argument '--version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version number.

To fix the bug, the Popen command should be changed to use the correct argument to fetch the version number. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This change uses the correct command to fetch the Fish shell version and should pass the failing test.
