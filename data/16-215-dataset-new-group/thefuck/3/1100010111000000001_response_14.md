The buggy function fails to extract the Fish version correctly which is causing the failing test. The call to Popen in the info function is using the wrong command and not matching the expected output from the test.

To fix the bug, we need to change the command passed to Popen in the info function to match the command used in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected version, I've changed the command to `['fish', '--version']` to match the failing test. Additionally, I've modified the code to correctly extract the version from the output of the command. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
