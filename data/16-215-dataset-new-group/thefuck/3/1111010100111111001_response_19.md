To fix the bug in the `info` function, we need to modify the way the command output is read and processed.

The bug in the current implementation is that the output of the `Popen` process is being read using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, which is resulting in only the version number (e.g., '3.5.9') being extracted from the full output ('fish, version 3.5.9'). This is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual output values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the command output is read to capture the full output of the command instead of just the version number.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    shell_info = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(shell_info)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the full output of the command, including the shell name and version.

This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
