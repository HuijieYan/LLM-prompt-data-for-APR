The bug in the `info` function seems to be related to the mismatch between the expected output and the actual output. The function is supposed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in the format 'Fish Shell X.X.X', but it seems to be returning the version in a different format.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the function is not correctly extracting the version from the output of the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command. The error message indicates that the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly extract and format the version from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly extract the version from the command output and return it in the expected format.
