The issue with the `info` function is the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish. This can result in an empty output or incomplete output being read from the process, causing the version number to be incorrect.

To fix this, we should use `proc.communicate()` to wait for the process to finish and read the output. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
