## The potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The Popen call may not be returning the expected version output from the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.
2. The decoding of the output from Popen may not be handled correctly.
3. The format of the returned string may not be correct.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of the command output and the version format in the fish.py file. This results in the function not returning the expected version of the Fish shell, leading to a failing test case.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the Popen call and the handling of the command output need to be verified for correctness. Additionally, the format of the returned string should be adjusted to match the expected output.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
