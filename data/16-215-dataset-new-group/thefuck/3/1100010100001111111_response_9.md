The issue with the current code is that it is not handling the expected output correctly. The "echo $FISH_VERSION" command in Fish Shell returns the version with the text "fish, version x.x.x" and the current code is only capturing the version number, not the complete string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we capture the version information from the shell command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'{}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly capture the complete version string and return it without any unexpected recursive loops or hanging during initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. This should resolve the issue that was posted on GitHub.
