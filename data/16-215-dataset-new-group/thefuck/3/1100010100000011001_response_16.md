## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(',')[1].strip())
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it does not handle the output of the command properly. The `version` variable contains the string "fish, version 3.5.9", and the buggy function returns the entire string without extracting the version number.

I modified the code to split the `version` string on the comma and take the second part of the resulting array, which should contain the version number. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the version number.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now return the version number of the Fish Shell as expected.
