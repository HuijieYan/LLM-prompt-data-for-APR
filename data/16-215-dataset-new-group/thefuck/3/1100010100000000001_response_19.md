## Fixing the buggy function

### Analyze the buggy function:
The function `info(self)` is designed to return the name and version of the current shell (Fish shell). It uses the `Popen` method from the `subprocess` module to execute a command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error locations in the buggy function could be related to how the subprocess is executed and how the output is read. Additionally, there could be potential issues with decoding the output.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug in the function is caused by not properly handling the subprocess output. Since the `Popen` method is asynchronous, it's possible that the output is not fully ready to be read when `proc.stdout.read()` is called.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should properly handle the subprocess call, ensuring that the output is read correctly and decoded without any issues.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version of the function, `communicate()` method is used to read the output of the subprocess, and then the output is decoded and stripped to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
