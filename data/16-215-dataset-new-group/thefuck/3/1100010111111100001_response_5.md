The bug in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is incorrect. 

The failing test `test_info` is failing because the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to obtain the Fish shell version. We should use the command `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
This change uses the correct command to obtain the Fish shell version and should pass the failing test.
