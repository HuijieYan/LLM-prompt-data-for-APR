# The buggy function appears to be trying to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. However, the use of Popen may lead to potential errors.

# The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The use of Popen without handling potential exceptions or errors.
2. The use of proc.stdout.read() without error handling or decoding.

# The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle potential errors that may occur during the execution of the subprocess or the decoding of the output.

# To fix the bug, the function should handle potential exceptions using try-except blocks and ensure proper handling of the subprocess output.

# Corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error retrieving Fish Shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```
