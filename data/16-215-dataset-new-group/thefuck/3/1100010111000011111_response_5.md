## The corrected version of the function

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Explanation:
1. The original code had the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which does not match the command expected in the test. The test expects the command 'fish --version'.
2. The Popen call in the original code was not matching the expected call from the test, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The original code was attempting to read the version from the environment variable FISH_VERSION, but the test expected the version to be retrieved using the command 'fish --version'.
4. The correction to the code involves changing the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' to match the expected behavior in the test.
5. With the corrected code, the Popen call matches the expected command from the test, and the function returns the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
