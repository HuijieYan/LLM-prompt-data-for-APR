## Analysis
The `info` function in the `Fish` class is designed to return the version of the Fish shell by executing a command using the `Popen` function. However, the code does not handle the proper reading of the command output, which leads to the reported issue.

## Bug
The bug occurs because the `Popen` function is not being used correctly. The incorrect handling of the subprocess output causes a recursive loop with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, leading to the hang issue.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the subprocess output from the `Popen` function and ensure that it doesn't cause a recursive loop.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
