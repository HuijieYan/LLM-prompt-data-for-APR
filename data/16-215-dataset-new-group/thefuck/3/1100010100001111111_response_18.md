### Bug Explanation
The issue is caused by the function not returning the expected version string, which causes a recursive loop and hangs the initialization when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The function is currently using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but it's not returning the expected output.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the command to get the version string in a way that ensures it returns the correct version without causing recursive loops.

### Corrected Function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
