The buggy function `info` is using the `Popen` function to execute a command and capture its output, but it is not properly handling the subprocess output. The `proc.stdout.read()` function is used to read the subprocess output, but it may block if the subprocess output is too large. This can cause a deadlock, and the function will not return until the subprocess finishes, which can lead to a performance issue.

A better approach is to use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object, which reads the entire output of the subprocess and avoids potential deadlocks. Additionally, it's important to handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the subprocess execution.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    proc.wait()  # Ensure the process has finished and the exit code is ready.
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, the `communicate` method is used to capture the output of the subprocess, and we also call `proc.wait()` to ensure that the subprocess has finished and the exit code is ready. This approach mitigates the potential deadlock issue and provides a more robust handling of the subprocess output.
