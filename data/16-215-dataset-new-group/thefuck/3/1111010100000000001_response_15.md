The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a subprocess and capturing its stdout. The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Use of `proc.stdout.read()` without checking for the `proc` process completion
2. The use of `Generic` class without its definition provided

The cause of the bug is that the `proc.stdout.read()` method doesn't guarantee that all data is available for reading. It's possible that the subprocess hasn't completed yet, leading to an empty result.

To fix the bug, we can add `proc.wait()` to ensure the process has completed before attempting to read the output.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()  # wait for the process to complete
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
