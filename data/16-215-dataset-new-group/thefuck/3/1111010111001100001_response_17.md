The bug in the given function is due to the incorrect command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The command used in the function 'info' is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which does not return the version in the correct format.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to change the command used to get the version of the Fish shell from 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to 'fish --version'.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the function 'info' will correctly return the version of the Fish shell.
