## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell using the `Popen` class from the subprocess module. However, it is not handling the process output correctly, leading to the incorrect version being returned.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of process output using `proc.stdout.read()`.
2. Potential issue with the command format for getting the version of the Fish shell.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the process output after executing the command to get the Fish shell version. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is not used correctly to retrieve the version information.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the process output and obtain the version of the Fish shell correctly.

## The Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the corrected version, `proc.communicate()[0]` is used to retrieve the output of the process, and `decode('utf-8').strip()` is used to obtain the version information correctly.
