The buggy function `info` from the class `Fish` in the file `fish.py` is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. However, it is failing because it is not correctly formatting the version number, leading to an assertion error in the test.

The cause of the bug is that the function is stripping the version number from the output, but not transforming it into the format expected by the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly format the version number before returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.replace('fish, version ', '') # Remove 'fish, version ' from the version string
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue posted on GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version formatting.
