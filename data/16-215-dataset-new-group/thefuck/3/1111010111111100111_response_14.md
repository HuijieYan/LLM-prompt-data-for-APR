## Correction:

The issue in the `info` function is that it is trying to check the version of Fish shell using an incorrect command. It uses `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version, but the correct command should be `fish --version`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly retrieve the version of Fish shell and pass the failing test. This resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect command.
