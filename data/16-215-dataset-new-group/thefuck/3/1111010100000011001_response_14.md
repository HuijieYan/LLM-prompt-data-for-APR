    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],

        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

# Explanation:
# The buggy function attempts to get the version of the Fish shell using the Popen function from the subprocess module, but it doesn't correctly handle the communication with the process.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
# The Popen function opens a pipe to the subprocess and should be used with context managers to ensure the process is properly closed after use.

# The corrected version of the function to handle the Popen process properly is as follows:
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        with Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                   stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL) as proc:
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
