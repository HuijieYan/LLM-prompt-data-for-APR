The potential error in the buggy function lies in the command used to obtain the version of the Fish shell. The command being used in the info() function is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', while the test case expects the version to be retrieved using 'fish --version'.

The cause of the bug is that the info() function is fetching the Fish shell version using an incorrect command, leading to the function returning an incorrect value. This discrepancy between the command used in the function and the expected command in the test case is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the info() function needs to be corrected to 'fish --version' to align with the expected command in the test case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the info() function will use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, satisfying the expectations of the failing test case and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
