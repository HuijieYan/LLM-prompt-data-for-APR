## The bug and its cause

The bug is causing the `info` function of the `Fish` class to return an incorrect version of the Fish shell. The expected version is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'` but the function is returning `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the output from the `Popen` process. The `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not correctly processing the version string.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly process the version string obtained from the `Popen` process. We can use string manipulation to extract the version number and then concatenate it with the `'Fish Shell'` prefix.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extract the version number
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

The corrected version of the function processes the version string correctly and returns the expected output.
