## Analysis
The `info` function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell by executing the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and capturing the output. The failing test sets up a mock `Popen` object to return the output `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'` when `shell.info()` is called. However, the function is trying to read the version from the output of `echo $FISH_VERSION`, and this is inconsistent with the expected output set up in the test. Additionally, the call to `Popen` uses `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` instead of `['fish', '--version']` as expected in the test.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not capturing the correct version string from the command output, and using the wrong command to obtain the version. This inconsistency causes the failing test and the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the command to `['fish', '--version']` to match the expected command in the failing test. We also need to parse the output to extract the version number correctly.  

## The corrected function
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_string = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version_string.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
