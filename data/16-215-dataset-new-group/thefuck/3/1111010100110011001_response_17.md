```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it doesn't correctly extract the version number from the output of the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'. It simply appends the entire output to the string 'Fish Shell'.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly assumes the output of the command will be in the format 'fish, version X.X.X'. However, from the error message, it's clear that the actual output is 'fish, version 3.5.9', and the function fails to extract just the version number.

To fix the bug, we modify the return statement to extract and return only the version number from the output of the command.

The corrected version of the function is provided above. It correctly extracts the version number from the output and returns it in the expected format.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
