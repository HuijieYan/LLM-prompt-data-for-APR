The bug in the `info` function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command used is `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test expects the command to be `fish --version`. This mismatch causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell, matching the expected output in the failing test.
