# The bug in the original function is that it is not correctly parsing the version string returned by the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. The output of the command is "fish, version 3.5.9" and the function should parse this output to obtain just the version number ("3.5.9").

# The `stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is not correctly parsing the version from the output of the command. It is including the "fish, version" part in the version string.

# To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly parse the version number from the output of the command.

# Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the version number is obtained by splitting the output of the command by spaces and taking the last element, which is just the version number.
