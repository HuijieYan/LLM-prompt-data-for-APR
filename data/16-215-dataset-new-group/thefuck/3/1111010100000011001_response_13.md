The buggy function `info` is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell installed on the system. The bug in this function is that it is not properly waiting for the `Popen` process to finish before reading the output from it.

The `Popen` function is used to create a new process and execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` in the Fish shell. However, the `info` function immediately tries to read the output from the process without waiting for it to finish.

To fix this bug, we can use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object, which will block until the process is completed and return the output. This ensures that we get the actual output of the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will properly wait for the `Popen` process to finish and retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
