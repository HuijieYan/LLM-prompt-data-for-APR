The bug in the given function `info` is that it is not returning the expected version information for the Fish shell. The function is using the `Popen` method to execute a command to get the Fish shell version, but it is not returning the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the correct version information. This is evident from the expected values, where the expected version information is `'fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of just `'3.5.9'`. This discrepancy is causing the recursive loop issue as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command executed by `Popen` to fetch the correct version information of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected version, the command executed by `Popen` is changed to `'fish --version'` to fetch the correct version information. This change aligns with the expected values and resolves the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
