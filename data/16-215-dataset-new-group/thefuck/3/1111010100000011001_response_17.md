The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command in a subprocess and reading the output. However, there are potential error locations in the function related to handling the subprocess and reading its output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the subprocess and its output, resulting in incorrect version information being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the subprocess, capture its output, and decode it to retrieve the version information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected version, we use the `communicate` method to capture the output of the subprocess and then decode it to retrieve the version information. This should properly handle the subprocess and return the correct version of the Fish shell.
