## Analysis
The buggy function `info` is called when the `-v` option is used with `thefuck` command, and it triggers a recursive loop with the Fish shell's initialization when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error locations in the `info` function are:
- The call to Popen might be causing the recursive loop.
- Reading the output from `proc.stdout` might not be handled properly.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the recursion loop triggered by the use of the `-v` option with `thefuck` command, which ultimately calls the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The `Popen` call might not be handling the output properly, resulting in the recursive loop.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the Popen call should be handled in a way that it doesn't trigger the recursion loop. Additionally, the output handling needs to be improved so that it doesn't interfere with the Fish shell's initialization.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
            stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error retrieving Fish shell version: {e}")
            return "Fish Shell (version unknown)"
```
