The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function seems to be related to the handling of the `sequential` model. The error message states, "Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead."

Looking at the code, the issue is that the function does not correctly handle models of type `Sequential`. The function raises an error if the model is of type `Sequential`, but it should instead convert the `Sequential` model into a functional model before proceeding with the cloning process.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the input `model` is of type `Sequential`. If it is, we need to convert it into a functional model, and then proceed with the cloning process. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    ...
    """
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        # Convert Sequential model to functional model
        model = SequentialModel.to_functional_model(model)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

Depending on the structure of the `SequentialModel` class, the conversion to a functional model might be different. But the key fix here is to identify the type of the input model and handle it accordingly before proceeding with the rest of the cloning process.
