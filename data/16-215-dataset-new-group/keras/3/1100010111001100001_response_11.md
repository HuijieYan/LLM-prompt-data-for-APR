The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function appears to be related to the creation and mapping of input tensors and layers. Additionally, there may be issues with the handling of multiple input and output layers.

One potential cause of the bug is that in the section where input layers are processed, there is an inconsistency in the usage of `input_layers` and `input_tensors`. This leads to a mismatch which causes issues in the subsequent steps of the function.

To fix this bug, it is important to ensure that the creation and mapping of input layers and input tensors are consistent and properly handled. Additionally, attention should be paid to the handling of multiple input and output layers to ensure that the tensors are correctly processed in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}  

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(tensor=layer.output) for layer in model.layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer.__class__ is InputLayer:
            input_layer = layer
            layer_map[layer] = input_layer
            tensor_map[layer.output] = input_tensors.pop(0)

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer.__class__ is InputLayer:
            continue
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes:
        inbound_layers = [layer_map[x] for x in node.inbound_layers]
        inbound_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in node.input_tensors]

        kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
        output_tensors = to_list(layer_map[node.outbound_layer](*inbound_tensors, **kwargs))

        for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
            tensor_map[x] = y

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version ensures that the input tensors and layers are consistent and properly handled, and it correctly processes multiple input and output layers.
