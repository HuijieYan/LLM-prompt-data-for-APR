The buggy `clone_model` function fails due to a bug in the logic for creating the new model. The primary issue is that the implementation fails to correctly replicate the behavior of the original model, particularly in handling input tensors and creating new layers with their own weights.

The bug seems to be related to the incorrect instantiation of the `Model` object with new input and output tensors, especially when dealing with multiple input and output layers.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully handle the input tensors, input layers, and the nodes of the reference model. Also, ensure that the output tensors are correctly computed and that the new model is instantiated with the appropriate input and output tensors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Code to handle input tensors and input layers
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = [layer for layer in model._input_layers]
        input_tensors = [
            Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                  dtype=layer.dtype,
                  sparse=layer.sparse,
                  name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers
        ]
        
    # Code to handle the creation of new layers and mapping of tensors
    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
        else:
            # Reuse previously cloned layer.
            new_layer = layer_map[layer]
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    # Input tensors and corresponding layers mapping
    input_tensors_map = {
        model.inputs[i]: input_tensors[i] for i in range(len(model.inputs))
    }

    # Code to handle computing output tensors based on input tensors
    output_tensors = []
    for node in model._nodes_by_depth[0]:
        layer = node.outbound_layer
        input_tensors = [input_tensors_map[x] for x in node.input_tensors]
        output_tensors.extend(layer(input_tensors))

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues caused by incorrectly handling input tensors, input layers, and creating new layers with their own weights. It should now correctly clone the original model, ensuring that it behaves the same way as the original model while using new input tensors and instantiated weights.
