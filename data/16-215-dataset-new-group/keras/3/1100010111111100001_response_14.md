The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the model's input layers and output layers, which leads to an assertion error when computing the model outputs.

The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is expecting a `Model` instance but is not correctly handling the case when the model is a `Sequential` instance, which causes the error. Additionally, there are issues with correctly mapping the input and output tensors when iterating over the nodes in the model and calling new layers based on the input tensors.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling different types of models (functional vs. sequential) and ensure that the input and output tensors are correctly mapped when iterating over the model nodes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Create a new dict to cache created layers
    layer_map = {}
    # Create a new dict to map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    tensor_map = {}

    # Handle the case where input_tensors are not provided by creating placeholders
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape[1:], dtype=layer.dtype, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]

    # Initialize the input tensor map
    for original_input, new_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[original_input] = (new_input, None)

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order
    for depth in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth)):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            outbound_layer = node.outbound_layer

            if outbound_layer not in layer_map:
                layer_config = outbound_layer.get_config()
                new_layer = outbound_layer.__class__.from_config(layer_config)
                layer_map[outbound_layer] = new_layer
            else:
                new_layer = layer_map[outbound_layer]

            input_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in node.input_tensors if x in tensor_map]

            computed_tensors = to_list(new_layer(input_tensors))

            for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, computed_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function addresses the issues related to handling different types of models and correctly mapping the input and output tensors when iterating over the model nodes. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
