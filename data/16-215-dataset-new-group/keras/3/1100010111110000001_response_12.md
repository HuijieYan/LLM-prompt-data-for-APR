The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is attempting to clone a functional Keras model, but it is failing to do so. The error message indicates that the function is unable to compute the output for a specific tensor, causing an `AssertionError`. 

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of input tensors and their corresponding layers when attempting to clone the model. The function is not properly mapping the input tensors to their corresponding layers, leading to errors in computing the outputs.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for mapping input tensors to their layers, as well as ensure that the model outputs are correctly computed. Additionally, we should check for the `Sequential` model type earlier in the function to prevent any potential misclassification of model types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Logic for mapping input tensors to their layers

    # Check if the model has input layers, if not, create placeholders
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape[1:], dtype=layer.input.dtype) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]

    # Create a mapping between input tensors and their corresponding layers
    input_layer_map = {layer.name: input_tensor for layer, input_tensor in zip(model.layers, input_tensors) if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)}

    # Iterate over the layers of the model and update the input layers with the mapped input tensors
    for layer in model.layers:
        for i in range(len(layer._inbound_nodes)):
            for idx, node_key in enumerate(layer._inbound_nodes[i].node_indices):
                input_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[i].input_tensors
                for j, input_tensor in enumerate(input_tensors):
                    if input_tensor.name in input_layer_map:
                        input_tensors[j] = input_layer_map[input_tensor.name]

    # Instantiate the new model using the updated input tensors and outputs
    input_tensors = [input_layer_map[layer.name] for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
    output_tensors = [layer.output for layer in model.layers if not any(isinstance(node.outbound_layer, Model) for node in layer._outbound_nodes)]
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The updated function properly maps the input tensors to their corresponding layers and creates a new model using these input tensors and outputs. With this revised logic, the function should be able to correctly clone the functional model without encountering the previous error.
