The issue seems to stem from the `clone_model` function in the `keras.models` module. The function is used to clone a functional model instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing them from the original model. The specific error message mentioned in the GitHub issue ("Could not compute output Tensor") indicates that there is an issue with the computation of the output tensors during the cloning process, potentially related to the handling of multi-output layers and their corresponding masks.

The root cause of the bug can be traced back to the logic for computing output masks. Specifically, the issue is related to the behavior of the `layer.compute_mask` method, which is expected to return a list of masks for each output tensor, but it always returns `None` since Lambda layers don't support using masks.

To fix this issue, a strategy is to update the code to handle the absence of masks for certain layers, specifically when cloning a functional model with layers that have multiple outputs and without mask support.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (previous code here)

    output_tensors = []
    output_masks = []  # Updated to store masks for each output tensor

    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]  # Retrieve the tensor and its mask
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
        output_masks.append(mask)  # Append the mask to the list

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name, output_masks=output_masks)
```

In this updated version, a new list `output_masks` is introduced to store the masks for each output tensor. When populating the `output_tensors`, we also populate the `output_masks` list, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

This strategy addresses the issue by explicitly handling the absence of masks for certain layers during the model cloning process. The updated logic ensures that the `output_masks` list contains the correct masks for each output tensor, even when layers with multiple outputs and without mask support are encountered.
