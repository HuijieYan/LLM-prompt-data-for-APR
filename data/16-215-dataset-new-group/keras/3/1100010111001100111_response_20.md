The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function arises from the incorrect handling of model outputs when the model contains layers with multiple outputs, especially when there is a lack of support for masks in some layers.

The failing test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` demonstrates a scenario with a functional model containing layers with multiple outputs. The model is cloned using the `clone_model` function, and the assertions at the end of the test compare the predictions from the original and cloned models, which are expected to be the same. However, the buggy function fails to correctly handle the layer outputs, leading to inconsistent predictions.

To fix the bug, the `_clone_functional_model` function needs to be modified to correctly handle layers with multiple outputs and ensure that the newly cloned model behaves identically to the original one.

Here's a corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                new_layer.build(node.input_shapes)
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map, then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of (tensor, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                kwargs = node.arguments
                computed_tensors, computed_masks = layer.compute_mask(computed_data, None)
                output_tensors = to_list(layer.call(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors, computed_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)

```

In this corrected version, changes have been made to ensure that multi-output layers are correctly handled, and the cloned model will behave identically to the original model.

By implementing these changes, the `clone_model` function should now correctly handle multi-output layers and ensure that the predictions from the original and cloned models are consistent, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
