The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` has several potential error locations. One of the main issues stems from incorrectly handling the input tensors and input layers when cloning the model. This results in the incorrect creation of the new model and leads to failures in the test.

The `input_layers` are not being properly handled, and there are issues with creating and caching new layers. Additionally, the mapping of input and output tensors is not functioning as intended.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle input tensors, input layers, and create a correct mapping of input and output tensors. The revised function should ensure that the new model is created correctly based on the behavior of the original model.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    tensor_map = {}  
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
        input_tensors = [layer.output for layer in input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    tensor_map = {model.input: input_tensor for input_tensor in input_tensors}
    
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer != model.input:
            x = layer.input
            y = layer.output
            tensor_map[y] = y

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[out] for out in model.outputs]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With the corrected function, it should now properly handle the input tensors, input layers, and create the correct mapping of input and output tensors to match the original model structure. The fixed function should now pass the failing test provided.
