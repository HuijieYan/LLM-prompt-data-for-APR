The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` has a few potential error locations that may be causing the failing test:
1. The creation of input_layers and input_tensors in case `input_tensors` is None: It seems that there is an issue with creating and caching the new input layers when `input_tensors` is None.
2. Processing layers with multiple input and output tensors: The function may not be handling layers with multiple input and output tensors correctly, causing an issue with computing the output tensors and masks.

The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` demonstrates an issue with the `clone_model` function when used with a model that has multiple inputs and outputs and a complex layer structure.

Based on the failing test and the runtime values provided, it seems like the variables `input_layers` and `input_tensors` are not being properly generated when `input_tensors` is None. This leads to issues in retrieving computed data and properly calling the layers, resulting in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input_layers and input_tensors are correctly created and cached, and that the function can properly handle layers with multiple inputs and outputs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape, dtype=layer.input.dtype) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
        
    for orig_input, new_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[orig_input] = (new_input, None) # tensor, mask
    
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
    
    for layer in model.layers:
        if not isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
            new_layer = layer_map[layer]
            input_tensors = [tensor_map[t][0] for t in layer.input]
            kwargs = {}
            if len(input_tensors) == 1:
                kwargs['input'] = input_tensors[0]
            else:
                kwargs['inputs'] = input_tensors
            
            computed_output = new_layer(**kwargs)
            masks = new_layer.compute_mask(input_tensors, None)
            for origin, computed, mask in zip(layer.output, to_list(computed_output), to_list(masks)):
                tensor_map[origin] = (computed, mask)
    
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[out][0] for out in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version ensures that new input tensors are properly created and cached when `input_tensors` is None, and it correctly processes the layers with multiple inputs and outputs, resolving the issues identified in the failing test.

With this correction, the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
