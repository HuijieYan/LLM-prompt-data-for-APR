The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` appears to be encountering an issue with computing the output tensors and masks for a functional model. This is causing the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` to result in an assertion error mentioning that it could not compute the output tensor.

Upon analyzing the provided GitHub issue, it seems that the problem is related to the `clone_model` function failing to compute output tensors in a specific scenario, where the model has multiple outputs without mask support. This is consistent with the error mentioned in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_clone_functional_model` function to correctly handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue where a layer with multiple outputs does not support masks.

Here's a corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function that resolves this issue:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.output.shape.as_list()[1:]) for layer in model._input_layers]

    for in_layer, out_layer in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[in_layer] = out_layer

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for node in model._nodes_by_depth:
        inbound_layers = [layer_map[tensor] for tensor in node.inbound_layers]
        args = {}
        for key, value in node.arguments.items():
            if isinstance(value, list) and all(K.is_keras_tensor(v) for v in value):
                args[key] = [layer_map[v] for v in value]
            else:
                args[key] = value
        output_tensors = layer_map[node.outbound_layer](inbound_layers, **args)
        for in_tensor, out_tensor in zip(node.input_tensors, output_tensors):
            tensor_map[in_tensor] = out_tensor

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[tensor] for tensor in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the input tensor specifications are provided if the `input_tensors` argument is not provided. Additionally, we correctly map the input tensors to the corresponding layers and handle the creation and mapping of new layers. Finally, we correctly compute the output tensors based on the input tensor mapping.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
