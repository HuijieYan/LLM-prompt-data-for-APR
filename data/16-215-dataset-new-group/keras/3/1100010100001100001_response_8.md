The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` seems to have a problem with the creation and mapping of input and output tensors. It is trying to clone a functional model by creating new layers and input tensors, but the mapping of the original and new layers/tensors appears to be incorrect.

The issue seems to lie within the block of code that handles the creation of input layers and the mapping of original layers to newly created layers. It also seems to be mishandling the creation and mapping of output tensors.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the input and output tensors are correctly created and mapped to the new layers. This can be done by carefully creating the input layers and output tensors, and then updating the `layer_map` and `tensor_map` accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}  

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
            tensor_map[layer.output] = input_tensor
    else:
        # Use provided input tensors
        input_layers = input_tensors
        for original_input, input_tensor in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[original_input] = input_tensor
            tensor_map[original_input.output] = input_tensor

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            for i, node in enumerate(model._nodes_by_depth[len(model._nodes_by_depth) - 1]):
                tensor_map[node.output_tensors[0]] = new_layer(input_layers[i])

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_layers, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this fixed version, we ensure that input and output tensors are correctly created and mapped to new layers by using the `layer_map` and `tensor_map` dictionaries. We also iterate through the nodes in the model to map the correct input/output tensors to the corresponding layers.

This should address the issues with creating and mapping input and output tensors and resolve the bug.
