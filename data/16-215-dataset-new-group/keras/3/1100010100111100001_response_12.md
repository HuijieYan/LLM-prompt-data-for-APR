The bug in the function `_clone_functional_model` is due to the mishandling of the input tensors and their corresponding layers. The function fails to properly create placeholder input tensors and map them to the layers during the cloning process. This results in a failure to compute the output tensors for the cloned model, leading to an assertion error.

The cause of the bug is traced to the mishandling of input tensors, improperly caching newly created input layers, and failing to properly map input tensors to their corresponding layers during the cloning process.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the input_tensors are properly created and mapped to the input_layers to avoid any issues in the subsequent layers.
2. Handle the creation and caching of the input layers to avoid discrepancies in the layer_map and tensor_map during the model cloning process.
3. Check for input_tensors and their corresponding layers in both branches of the input_tensors condition to avoid any discrepancies.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from keras.engine.training import Model
from keras.engine.input_layer import Input
from keras.engine.input_layer import InputLayer

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    input_layers = model._input_layers
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = [Input(tensor=x) if not K.is_keras_tensor(x) else x for x in to_list(input_tensors)]

    for original, cloned in zip(input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original] = cloned

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected version, the input tensors are properly created, and their mapping to the input layers is appropriately handled. Additionally, the caching of the input layers and their mapping in the layer_map and tensor_map is handled to ensure the correctness of the model cloning process.
