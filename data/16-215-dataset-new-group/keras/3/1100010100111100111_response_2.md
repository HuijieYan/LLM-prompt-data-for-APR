The bug in the _clone_functional_model function is causing the AssertionError: 'Could not compute output' error. The issue stated that the output_masks are expected to be [None, None] but are always [None]. This happens because the layer.compute_mask(...) always returns None, and Lambda layer doesn't support using masks.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the layer.compute_mask(...) returns None by directly setting output_masks to [None, None] when the computed_masks are None. This will ensure that the output_masks are correctly set, regardless of the layer's mask support.

Here's the corrected version of the _clone_functional_model function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... [existing code]

    if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
        # Call layer.
        if node.arguments:
            kwargs = node.arguments
        else:
            kwargs = {}
        if len(computed_data) == 1:
            # ... [existing code]
        else:
            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

            if computed_masks is None:  # Handle the case where computed_masks are None
                output_masks = [None, None]
            else:
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                        kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(
                    layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors,
                                       computed_masks))
            # ... [existing code]

    # ... [existing code]
```

This correction addresses the issue where the output_masks are not being correctly set when computed_masks are None. By setting output_masks to [None, None] in this case, we ensure that the output_masks are correctly handled regardless of the layer's mask support.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the _clone_functional_model function works as expected when using a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support.
