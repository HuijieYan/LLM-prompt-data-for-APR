The bug in the provided function is likely causing an incorrect cloning of a functional model instance, resulting in unexpected behavior when used with new input tensors.

The potential error locations and causes of the bug include:
1. The `tensor_map` variable is not correctly populated when all input tensors come from a Keras layer. This may lead to missing output tensors and a failure in computing the model outputs.
2. The loop over every node in the reference model, in depth order, may not be handling layers and input tensors correctly, leading to an incorrect instantiation of a new model from inputs and outputs.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to ensure that the correct input tensors are used to build the model and that the model outputs are correctly computed before instantiating a new model from inputs and outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Create a new list of input tensors if not provided and handle input tensors correctly
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
    
    # Build the model on top of the input tensors
    x = input_tensors[0]
    for layer in model.layers:
        x = layer(x)
    
    return Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=x)
```

In this corrected version, we address the bug by creating new input tensors if not provided and ensuring that the model is built correctly using these input tensors. This should prevent unexpected behavior when using the cloned model with new input tensors.
