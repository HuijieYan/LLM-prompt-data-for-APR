The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` has a few issues that are causing the failing test. After analyzing the provided details, it seems that the main issues are with the manipulation of input layers and tensors. Specifically, the function is not correctly handling input layers and their corresponding tensors, which leads to incorrect model cloning.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the input layers and their tensors are appropriately handled during the cloning process. Additionally, the function needs to properly iterate over the model's nodes and update the tensor map accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
        for orig, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[orig] = cloned
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            name = model._input_layers[i].name
            input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
            layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = input_tensor
            tensor_map[x] = (input_tensor, None)

    for depth in reversed(range(len(model._nodes_by_depth))):
        for node in model._nodes_by_depth[depth]:
            layer = node.outbound_layer
            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer

            ref_input_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in node.input_tensors if x in tensor_map]
            computed_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in ref_input_tensors]
            kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}

            if len(computed_tensors) == 1:
                computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_tensors[0], None
            else:
                computed_masks = [tensor_map[x][1] for x in ref_input_tensors if tensor_map[x][1] is not None]
                computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_tensors, computed_masks

            output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
            output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensor, computed_mask))

            for (x, y, mask) in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With the corrected function, it should now properly handle the input layers and their corresponding tensors, as well as iterate over the model's nodes and update the tensor map accordingly. This should address the issues that are causing the failing test.
