The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is causing the failing test. The error message indicates that the model that is being passed is not being considered a functional `Model` instance, triggering a `ValueError`. This happens because the function checks if the model is an instance of `Sequential` without considering whether it's a subclass of `Model`. Additionally, there might be an issue with the creation and mapping of input layers when input tensors are not provided.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to accurately recognize functional `Model` instances and handle the creation and mapping of input layers properly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    if not issubclass(model.__class__, Model):  # Fix to check for subclasses of Model
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):  # Adjusting the check for Sequential instances
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}  

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

This correction updates the first condition to check if the input `model` is a subclass of `Model`, ensuring that both `Model` instances and their subclasses are correctly recognized. Additionally, the error related to the incorrect recognition of `Sequential` instances is addressed by validating that the input model is not an instance of `Sequential`.

After making these changes, the `assert` statement in the failing test should pass, and the corresponding error should be resolved.
