The error message indicates that the model cannot compute some of the output tensors during the cloning process. This is likely due to an issue in the `_clone_functional_model` function, where the input tensors and corresponding layers are not being properly mapped to each other.

The issue seems to be related to the creation and management of input and output tensors, as well as the mapping of layers during the cloning process.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that:
1. Input tensors are properly created or mapped if provided.
2. Output tensors are correctly computed and mapped to their corresponding input tensors and layers.
3. Layer mapping and cloning are handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_clone_functional_model` function as follows:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """
    Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    ... [rest of the docstring and arguments]

    """

    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged

    # Instead of the original return statement, we update the logic to create a new model from inputs and outputs.
    if input_tensors is not None:
        # Use the input tensors provided
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
    else:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape) for layer in model.layers
                            if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]

    # Get the output tensors
    output_tensors = [layer.output for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]

    return Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By making these changes, we ensure that input tensors are properly handled whether provided or created, and the output tensors are correctly obtained from the model's layers. This should address the mapping and cloning issues, resulting in a corrected and functional `clone_functional_model` function.
