The bug in the _clone_functional_model function is related to the incorrect construction of the input_tensors and input_layers when input_tensors are not provided.

The cause of the bug is that the loop creating the input_tensors and input_layers is not properly executed, resulting in an empty input_layers list. This causes issues when attempting to clone the layers and results in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to ensure that the input_layers list is correctly populated with the input layers when input_tensors are not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
        for original, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[original] = cloned
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                layer_map[x._keras_history[0]] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that when input_tensors are not provided, input_layers are correctly created and populated, resolving the issue with incorrect layer cloning.

With this correction, the failing test should pass.
