The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` contains several issues which cause the function to fail. Here are the identified issues:

1. The `input_layers` list is not properly populated when `input_tensors` is `None`. This results in an empty `input_layers` list, leading to an empty `input_tensors` list, which causes issues with the subsequent cloning process.
2. The loop that tries to create placeholders for the input layers is not correctly appending the newly created input layers to the `input_layers` list, resulting in a mismatch between input layers and input tensors.
3. There are issues with the management of input tensors when not using placeholders, which causes issues with tensor mapping.

To fix this, several adjustments need to be made to the function. The logic for handling input tensors (both placeholders and non-placeholder cases) needs to be revised, and the logic for cloning layers and managing the input layer cache needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)
    
    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) 
                         for layer in model._input_layers]
        layer_map = {original: new for original, new in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors)}
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                layer_map[x._keras_history[0]] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # (remaining code remains the same)
```

With these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function should now pass the failing test without the previous AssertionError.
