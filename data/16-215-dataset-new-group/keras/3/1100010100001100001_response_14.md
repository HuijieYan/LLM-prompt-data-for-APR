The bug in the provided function seems to lie in the logic related to creating placeholders and mapping input layers to their corresponding placeholder tensors.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not correctly handling the creation of input placeholders and mapping them to the input layers. This results in an incorrect association between the original input layers and the newly created input tensors.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the creation of input tensors and the mapping of input layers to their corresponding tensors is done correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = model._input_layers
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]
        layer_map = dict(zip(input_layers, input_tensors))
    else:
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensors[i] = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                layer_map[x._keras_history[0]] = input_tensors[i]._keras_history[0]
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    # rest of the function remains the same...

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, the creation of input tensors and the mapping of input layers to their corresponding tensors is handled correctly, ensuring that the placeholders are associated with the correct input layers. This should resolve the issues with the function.
