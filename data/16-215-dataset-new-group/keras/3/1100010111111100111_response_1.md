### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The conditional checks at the start of the `_clone_functional_model` function are not correctly identifying whether the `model` argument is an instance of `Model` or `Sequential`.
2. The creation of input layers and input tensors in the `if input_tensors is None` block seems to be causing issues as it doesn't properly update the `input_layers` list.
3. The iteration over nodes and corresponding layers seems to be leading to issues with identifying and calling the correct layers.

### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is causing issues with correctly cloning a functional `Model` instance. This is leading to an error when trying to compute the output tensors of the model. The failing test case with multiple outputs is exposing the issue by raising an AssertionError, indicating that the output tensor could not be computed.

The GitHub issue suggests that the issue is related to the use of `clone_model` with a functional model containing a layer with multiple outputs without mask support. The issue is related to the calculation of output masks and the lack of proper handling when cloning such models.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the conditional checks at the start of the `_clone_functional_model` function to correctly identify whether the `model` argument is an instance of `Model` or `Sequential`.
2. Modify the creation of input layers and input tensors in the `if input_tensors is None` block to properly update the `input_layers` list.
3. Improve the iteration over nodes and corresponding layers to ensure correct identification and calling of the layers.
4. Address the issue with correct handling of layers with multiple outputs without mask support.

### The corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same docstring as before)

    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ' + str(model))
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead: ' + str(model))

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    input_layers = model._input_layers
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input_shape[1:]) for layer in input_layers]

    for orig_input, new_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[orig_input] = (new_input, None)

    for depth in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth)):
        for node in model._nodes_by_depth[depth]:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                new_layer = layer_map[layer]

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = [(tensor_map[x][0], tensor_map[x][1]) for x in reference_input_tensors if x in tensor_map]

            computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
            computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

            kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}

            output_tensors = to_list(new_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
            computed_tensors = computed_tensors if hasattr(new_layer, 'compute_mask') else [computed_tensors]

            output_masks = to_list(new_layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks)) if hasattr(new_layer, 'compute_mask') else [None] * len(output_tensors)

            for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This version of the function aims to correctly handle cloning of a functional `Model` instance, including proper handling of input tensors, creation of new layers, and correct identification of layer outputs and masks.
