The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the way new input layers are being created and cached in the `layer_map` dictionary.

The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is supposed to create a clone of a functional model, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the existing layers and weights. However, when creating new input layers, it is not properly updating the `layer_map` which causes issues later in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `layer_map` is updated correctly when creating new input layers. Additionally, we need to ensure that the input layers and tensors are correctly handled throughout the cloning process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
    else:
        for i, layer in enumerate(model._input_layers):
            original_input_layer = layer._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[original_input_layer] = input_tensors[i]

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
In this corrected version, the creation of new input layers is simplified and the `layer_map` is updated accordingly to ensure that the clones of layers are correctly stored and retrieved. Additionally, the handling of input tensors and output tensors is improved to properly reflect the changes made during the cloning process.
