The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` seems to be failing when used to clone models with multiple inputs and outputs. The `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` test case checks if the cloned model's predictions are the same as the original model's predictions, and it's failing due to incorrect predictions.

The cause of the bug appears to be incorrect handling of multiple input and output tensors when cloning the model.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle multiple input and output tensors when cloning the model.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # (previous implementation)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = keras.layers.deserialize({'class_name': layer.__class__.__name__, 'config': layer.get_config()})
                new_layer.build(node.input_shapes)
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, keras.layers.InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors

            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                output_tensors = layer(computed_data)
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = y

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return keras.models.Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the logic for cloning layers and handling multiple input and output tensors. Now the function should be able to handle models with multiple inputs and outputs, and the failing test should pass with the corrected function.
