The potential errors in the provided code are as follows:
1. The condition check for whether the input `model` is an instance of `Sequential` is incorrect. It checks for `isinstance(model, Sequential)` after already checking for `not isinstance(model, Model)`. If `model` is not an instance of `Model`, then it doesn't need to check for whether it is a `Sequential` model. Instead, the condition should check whether the input model is an instance of `Functional` model by importing it as `from keras.models import Model`.

2. There is an issue in the logic that builds the model upon the input layers. Additionally, there are issues with handling input tensors and masks.

3. The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect conditional check and the handling of input tensors and masks. The function does not correctly handle building the model upon input tensors and placing placeholders to build the model upon. This results in the model not being correctly cloned and instantiated from the inputs and outputs.

4. To fix the bug, a strategy would be to improve the conditional checks for the type of model and update the logic of building the model upon input tensors to ensure it correctly identifies and handles input tensors and masks.

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from keras.models import Model
from keras.engine.network import Network
from keras.layers import Input, InputLayer

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model) and not isinstance(model, Network):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` or `Network` instance, got ', model)
    
    if isinstance(model, InputLayer):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got an `InputLayer` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model.input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                # Cache newly created input layer.
                original_input_layer = x._keras_history[0]
                newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
                layer_map[original_input_layer] = newly_created_input_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the above corrected version:
- The condition checks for the type of model input have been updated to handle both `Model` and `Network` instances correctly.
- The input tensor and mask handling logic has been updated to correctly cache the newly created input layers and build the model upon the input tensors.
