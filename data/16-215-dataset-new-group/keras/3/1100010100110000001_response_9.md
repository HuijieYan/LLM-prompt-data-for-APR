The error occurs when the `clone_model` function is called with a model having multiple outputs. The function expects the input model to be a functional model but received the error that it got a `Sequential` instance instead. This is the cause of the error as the `_clone_functional_model` function expects the `model` argument to be an instance of `Model` and not an instance of `Sequential`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if the model is an instance of `Sequential`. If it is, an error should be raised since the function expects a functional `Model` instance:

```python
if isinstance(model, Sequential):
    raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead: ' + str(model))
```

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ' + str(model))
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead: ' + str(model))

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly raise an error if the input model is a `Sequential` instance and the failing test should pass.
