The bug in the function `_clone_functional_model` is likely to be causing the failing tests due to incorrect handling of the input_tensors and the layer mapping, which ultimately leads to an incorrect output model.

The function is intended to create a new functional model from an existing one, with newly instantiated weights and new layers. It uses a few different maps to keep track of layers and tensors as it iterates through the existing model. The issue seems to be with how the new input tensors are being created and mapped.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input_tensors and input_layers are properly handled and that the layer mapping is correctly updated as new layers are created.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape[1:], dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name+'_input') for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for original_layer, input_tensor in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_layer] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
    
    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth)):
        for node in model._nodes_by_depth[depth]:
            outbound_layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if outbound_layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer
                outbound_layer_config = outbound_layer.get_config()
                new_layer = outbound_layer.__class__.from_config(outbound_layer_config)
                layer_map[outbound_layer] = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                new_layer = layer_map[outbound_layer]

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            computed_tensors, computed_masks = [], []
            kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
            for computed_tensor, computed_mask in computed_data:
                if 'mask' not in kwargs and hasattr(new_layer, 'supports_masking') and new_layer.supports_masking:
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                    computed_masks = [computed_mask] if computed_mask else []
                else:
                    computed_tensors.append(computed_tensor)
                    if computed_mask:
                        computed_masks.append(computed_mask)

            output_tensors = to_list(new_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
            output_masks = to_list(new_layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

            for original_output, new_output, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                tensor_map[original_output] = (new_output, mask)

    # Check the model outputs in tensor_map, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for output in model.outputs:
        if output in tensor_map:
            output_tensors.append(tensor_map[output][0])
        else:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ', output)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version of the function, I modified the input tensor creation and mapping process to ensure that the input layers are properly handled and that the layer mapping is updated correctly as new layers are created during the iteration. Additionally, I also made minor adjustments to the iteration process to ensure it covers all nodes effectively.
