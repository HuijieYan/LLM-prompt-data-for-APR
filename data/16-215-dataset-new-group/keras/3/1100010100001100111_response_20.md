The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is causing the `multi_gpu_model` function to raise an AssertionError when `cpu_relocation=True`. The issue is that the `clone_model` function is not correctly handling a multi-output model where one of the layers doesn't support mask computation. This leads to the `output_masks` always being `[None]` instead of the expected `[None, None]`, resulting in the error.

To fix the bug, the `_clone_functional_model` function needs to be modified to correctly handle layers with multiple outputs and no mask support. Specifically, the part of the function that handles the computation of `output_masks` for layers with multiple outputs needs to be updated to account for layers that don't support mask computation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask (setting mask to None initially)

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (existing code)

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs and computed_mask is not None:  # Check if mask is not None
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                    output_tensors = to_list(
                        layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = to_list(
                        layer.compute_mask(computed_tensor, computed_mask))
                    computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                    computed_masks = [computed_mask]
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                    computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and any(mask is not None for mask in computed_masks):  # Check if any mask is not None
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                    output_tensors = to_list(
                        layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = to_list(
                        layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors,
                                      output_tensors,
                                      output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)  # Update the mask

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we have added checks to ensure that the layer's mask is only used if it's not None for layers with multiple outputs. This modification should address the issue raised in the GitHub post and ensure that the `multi_gpu_model` function works as expected with the given model.
