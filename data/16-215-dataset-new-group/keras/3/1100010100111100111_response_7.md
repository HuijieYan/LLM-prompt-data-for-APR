To fix the bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function, the issue description suggests that the problem may be related to layer masks when using `clone_model` with a functional model that includes a layer with multiple outputs and no mask support. The issue was found to be occurring with `clone_model` when `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True` was used.

The problem is specifically identified in this part of the code:
```python
if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
    # Call layer.
    if node.arguments:
        kwargs = node.arguments
    else:
        kwargs = {}
    if len(computed_data) == 1:
        computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
        if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
            if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
        output_tensors = to_list(
            layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
        output_masks = to_list(
            layer.compute_mask(computed_tensor,
                               computed_mask))
        computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
        computed_masks = [computed_mask]
    else:
        computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
        computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
        if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
            if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
        output_tensors = to_list(
            layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
        output_masks = to_list(
            layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors,
                               computed_masks))
    # Update tensor_map.
    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors,
                          output_tensors,
                          output_masks):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
```
It's seen that the error is occurring due to discrepancies when layers do not support masks.

To fix this bug, input parameters should be checked and processed separately based on the requirements for masks. If a layer does not support masks, then the mask should be set to None to avoid the error.

Below is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
        
    # Other checks and variable initializations remain the same as in the original code

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Set mask to None if the input tensor does not support masks

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In this corrected version, when setting up the `tensor_map`, if the input tensors do not support masks, the mask is explicitly set to `None` to prevent the error when computing the output tensors.

This approach ensures that the function can handle layers without mask support, which was identified as the issue in the GitHub report.
