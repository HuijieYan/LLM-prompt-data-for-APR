The code provided is the implementation of a function called `_clone_functional_model`, which is intended to clone a functional `Model` instance. The overall logic of the function seems to be correct, but there are some potential error locations within the function:

1. There is a missing import statement for the required modules.
2. The code for creating placeholder input layers is incorrect.
3. The logic for caching the newly created input layers is not functioning properly.

The cause of the bug is that the code does not correctly handle the creation and caching of input layers while cloning the model.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for creating placeholder input layers and caching the newly created input layers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from .engine.input_layer import Input
from .engine.training import Model

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for i, layer in enumerate(model._input_layers):
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor
        input_tensors = input_layers
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model.inputs[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                layer_map[model.inputs[i]] = input_tensor
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order
    for depth, nodes in sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.items(), reverse=True):
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer
                layer = layer_map[layer]

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs
    return Model(input_tensors, [layer_map[output] for output in model.outputs], name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version, the issues related to creating and caching input layers have been addressed. Additionally, I've added the required import statements at the beginning of the code.
