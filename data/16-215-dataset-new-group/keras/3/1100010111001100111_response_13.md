The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function seems to be caused by issues with handling multiple inputs and outputs in the model cloning process. The issue on GitHub also highlights problems with the `clone_model` function when using multi_gpu_model with `cpu_relocation=True`.

The bug may be occurring due to the incorrect handling of multiple input and output tensors, as well as issues related to masks and layer support for masks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling multiple input and output tensors in the `_clone_functional_model` function. Additionally, we should address the issue related to layer support for masks.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Check for mask support in the layer
    support_mask = has_arg(layer.call, 'mask')

    # Modify the code to handle multiple input and output tensors
    computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask)
    if support_mask:
        for x in reference_input_tensors:
            if x in tensor_map:
                computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])
    elif len(reference_input_tensors) == len(input_tensors):
        computed_data = [(input_tensors[i], None) for i in range(len(input_tensors))]

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this modification, we are checking for mask support in the layer and handling the input and output tensors accordingly. This should resolve the issues related to cloning functional models with multiple inputs and outputs.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `clone_model` function works correctly, as reported in the GitHub issue.
