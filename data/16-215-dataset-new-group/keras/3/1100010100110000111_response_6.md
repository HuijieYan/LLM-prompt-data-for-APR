## Analysis
Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when using `clone_model` on a model that has multiple inputs and outputs, especially when the layers do not support masks. The issue arises when attempting to compute output masks for layers where the `compute_mask` method will always return `None`. This causes the error in the `assert` statement when computing the model outputs.

## Bug Location
The bug seems to be located in the `clone_functional_model` function when handling layers that do not support masks.

## Bug Cause
The fundamental cause of the bug is that the `clone_functional_model` function does not handle layers without mask support correctly, causing the assertion error when computing the model outputs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `clone_functional_model` function to handle layers without mask support more gracefully and avoid errors when computing the model outputs.

## Updated corrected version of the function
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Rest of the code remains the same, but with changes to handle layers without mask support

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # Call the layer while handling layers without mask support
            kwargs = {} if node.arguments is None else node.arguments  # get arguments
            output_tensors = to_list(layer(reference_input_tensors, **kwargs))
            output_tensors = to_list(output_tensors)  # convert to list

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Set mask as None

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]  # Get the output tensors
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

By making these changes to the `_clone_functional_model` function, we handle layers without mask support more gracefully and avoid errors when computing the model outputs. This should resolve the AssertionError raised in the failing test case and the issue posted on GitHub.
