The cause of the bug is that the function is failing to correctly compute new output tensors and masks for the cloned model, resulting in an assertion error at the end of the function.

The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the function creates new layers and computes new output tensors and masks for the cloned model.

To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Create placeholders for inputs if `input_tensors` is not provided.
2. Ensure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer by caching the input layer when necessary.
3. Update the `tensor_map` with computed output tensors and masks for each layer in the model.
4. Ensure that the function is correctly computing the output tensors for the cloned model.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same function signature and docstring)

    # Error handling for model type
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got {}'.format(type(model)))

    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead: {}'.format(model))

    # Create placeholders to build the model on top of if input_tensors is not provided
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]

    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order
    for node in model._nodes_by_depth:
        # Get the layer corresponding to the node
        layer = node.outbound_layer

        # Create a new layer for the cloned model
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())

        # Compute input and output tensors for the new layer
        input_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in node.input_tensors if x in tensor_map]
        output_tensors = new_layer(*input_tensors)

        # Update tensor_map with computed output tensors and masks
        for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
            tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Ensure that we computed the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version of the function should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
