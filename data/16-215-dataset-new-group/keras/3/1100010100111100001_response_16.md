The bug in the _clone_functional_model function is causing it to fail when invoked by keras.models.clone_model. This function is meant to clone a functional Model instance by creating a new instance of a Model with newly instantiated weights and layers. However, the function is not creating new layers as intended, which is causing the error.

The bug occurs because there is an issue with the creation and mapping of the input tensors to the corresponding tensors. The function is not correctly handling the input tensor creation and layer mapping, which results in a failure to correctly compute the model outputs.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to revise the part of the function that creates the placeholders for new input tensors and ensures that all layers are correctly cloned and mapped. Additionally, the logic for handling the input tensors and output tensors within the iteration over the nodes of the reference model needs to be thoroughly checked and adjusted.

Below is the corrected version of the _clone_functional_model function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [K.placeholder(shape=inp.shape, name=inp.name) for inp in model.inputs]

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map, then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).

            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}

                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]

                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]  # Get the corresponding tensors from the tensor_map
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
