The issue with the given function _clone_functional_model is that it is not cloning the model properly. The code contains a few issues that should be addressed:
1. The function is intended to clone a functional `Model` instance, but it is currently not performing this task correctly.
2. The layer_map and tensor_map are being used to cache the created layers and tensors, but there are inaccuracies in populating these caches.
3. The input_layers list is not being constructed properly.
4. There is a check for the existence of masks but the implementation to handle masks is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input_layers are constructed correctly, and the caches are populated accurately. Additionally, we need to handle the masks properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The correct version of the function
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
        to build the model upon. If not provided,
        placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = model.inputs
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer._keras_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]
        for layer, tensor in zip(input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[layer] = tensor
    else:
        # Make sure that all input tensors come from a Keras layer.
        # If tensor comes from an input layer: cache the input layer.
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        _input_tensors = []
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model.inputs[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                _input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
                layer_map[model.inputs[i]] = input_tensor
            else:
                _input_tensors.append(x)
        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every layer in the reference model, in depth order.
    for layer in model.layers:
        # Get or create layer.
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        reference_input_tensors = layer.input
        reference_output_tensors = layer.output

        # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
        # then call the layer on them.
        if all(x in tensor_map for x in reference_input_tensors):
            input_tensors, masks = zip(*(tensor_map[x] for x in reference_input_tensors))
            kwargs = layer._updated_config
            updated_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config(), custom_objects={})
            output_tensors = updated_layer(*input_tensors, **kwargs)

            for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    outputs = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, outputs, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The input layers are correctly retrieved from the model.
2. The caches for layers and tensors have been updated to store the correct mappings.
3. The process of calling layers is improved through the iteration and retrieval of input and output tensors.

These corrections should address the issues present in the original function and make it work as intended.
