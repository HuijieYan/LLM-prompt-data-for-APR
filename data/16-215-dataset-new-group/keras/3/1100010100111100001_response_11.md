The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function arises because the function checks if the input model is an instance of `Model` and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. However, the model in this case is actually an instance of `Sequential`, which is a subclass of `Model`. As a result, the function should not be raising an error in this case.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `if` condition that checks the instance type of the input model. Instead of checking if the input model is an instance of `Model`, we should check if it's an instance of `Sequential`. If it is, then we should just return the input model without performing any further operations. Only if the input model is a non-sequential `Model` instance, should we proceed with the cloning process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        return model  # If the input model is a Sequential model, return it directly
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle instances of `Sequential` and avoid raising an error when it encounters such instances.
