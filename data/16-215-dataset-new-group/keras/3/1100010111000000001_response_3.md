The reason why the `_clone_functional_model` function fails to execute the `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` test is because the `Model` class is not being imported and used correctly. The function expects an instance of the `Model` class as an argument, but the import statement for the `Model` class is not provided.

To fix the bug, we need to import and instantiate the `Model` class correctly and then use it to create a new model with the same behavior as the original model. Additionally, we need to check if the provided `input_tensors` argument is a list and handle it accordingly.


Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.engine.training import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]  # Create placeholders for input tensors

    output_tensors = [layer(input_tensors) for layer in model.layers if layer not in input_tensors]  # Call the layers on the input tensors

    new_model = Model(input_tensors, output_tensors)  # Instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs
    return new_model
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test.
