The bug in the `models.py` file seems to be related to the `clone_model()` function where the output tensors are not being computed correctly for models with layers that have multiple outputs without a mask support.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_clone_functional_model` function to handle the case where the layer doesn't support masks and adjust the computation of output masks accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... existing code ...

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... existing code ...
            
    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
            output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            # If the output tensor is not in the tensor_map, try to recover the original tensor
            original_tensors = [key for key, value in tensor_map.items() if value[0] is x]
            assert original_tensors, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
            original_tensor = original_tensors[0]
            tensor_map[x] = (original_tensor, None)  # Use the original tensor and no mask
            output_tensors.append(original_tensor)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this correction, we handle the case where the output tensor may not have been directly computed and instead try to recover the original tensor if it's not in the tensor_map. We set the mask to None in case the layer does not support masks.

This update should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `clone_model()` function works as expected for models with layers that have multiple outputs without mask support.
