The bug in the provided code is likely due to the failure to correctly compute the output tensors and masks, resulting in the 'Could not compute output Tensor' error. This issue is related to the use of multi_gpu_model with cpu_relocation=True in the original GitHub issue.

The main potential error location within the buggy function is in the computation of the output_tensor and output_masks, specifically for layers that do not support using masks.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the logic related to computing the output tensors and masks for layers that do not support mask computation. This may involve handling these cases differently and ensuring that the output masks are properly handled.

Below is the corrected version of the function based on the analysis:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
        for original, cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
            layer_map[original] = cloned
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        layer_map = {original: input_ for original, input_ in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors)}

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    for depth in sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.keys(), reverse=True):
        for node in model._nodes_by_depth[depth]:
            outbound_layer = node.outbound_layer

            if outbound_layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = outbound_layer.__class__.from_config(outbound_layer.get_config())
                layer_map[outbound_layer] = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                outbound_layer = layer_map[outbound_layer]

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(outbound_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for computing output tensors and masks has been modified to ensure that it handles layers that do not support mask computation properly, addressing the issue that was experienced with multi_gpu_model and cpu_relocation=True.
