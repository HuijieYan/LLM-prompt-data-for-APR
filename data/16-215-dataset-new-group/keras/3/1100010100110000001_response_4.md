## Analysis
The error message occurs because the `clone_model` function was unable to compute the output tensors for the given input model. The failing test was `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs`.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the function `_clone_functional_model` where it fails to properly gather the input tensors and call the layers for cloning.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function doesn't properly update the `tensor_map` during the cloning process, resulting in an inability to compute the output tensors of the new model.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for updating the `tensor_map` during the cloning process. We should ensure that the `tensor_map` is updated properly for each input tensor and that the output tensors are computed correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Update tensor_map.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            # Call layer if computation is possible
            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, I have updated the code within the for loop for updating the `tensor_map` based on the computed input and output tensors. This should fix the bug by ensuring that the `tensor_map` is updated correctly during the cloning process.
