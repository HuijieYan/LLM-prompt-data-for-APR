The bug in the function `_clone_functional_model` appears to be causing an assertion error when trying to compute the model outputs. The error is occurring because the function is unable to compute the output tensors for the given model.

The cause of this bug is that the function is not properly handling the input layers and reference tensors when trying to clone the model for layers with multiple inputs and outputs, resulting in an inability to compute the model outputs.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to amend the logic for handling the input layers and reference tensors, particularly for cases where there are multiple inputs and outputs for a layer.

Now, let's provide a corrected version of the function based on the identified issue.

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning creates new layers and weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    # ... (input validation checks)

    layer_map = {}  
    tensor_map = {}  

    # Create placeholders if input_tensors is not provided
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.get_shape(), dtype=layer.input.dtype) for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        # Validate input_tensors
        for x in input_tensors:
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                raise ValueError('All input tensors must come from a Keras layer.')

    # Map input tensors to model input layers
    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    for depth in range(max(model._nodes_by_depth.keys()), -1, -1):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                layer = node.outbound_layer
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}

                # Handle masking
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data] if any(x[1] is not None for x in computed_data) else None
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                
                # Call the layer and update tensor_map
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                tensor_map.update(zip(node.output_tensors, zip(output_tensors, to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))))

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version, the function has improved handling of the input layers and reference tensors, as well as the logic for computing and updating the output tensors. This should address the issue and allow the function to successfully clone the functional model.
