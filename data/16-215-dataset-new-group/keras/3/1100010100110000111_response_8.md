The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` has an error in handling the input_tensors argument, resulting in an `AssertionError` stating "Could not compute output" when the `clone_model` function is used.

The cause of the bug is that the function failed to correctly handle the input tensors provided to the model. The error occurred because the function did not properly compute the output tensors and masks for the input layers, specifically when dealing with multiple inputs and outputs with a layer that does not support masks.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the input tensors are properly handled, and the layer masks are computed correctly even when the original layers do not support masks. This involves updating the logic for computing output tensors and masks when handling multiple input and output layers.

To address the bug and resolve the GitHub issue, we need to modify the `_clone_functional_model` function. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged from the original

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            computed_tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
            output_tensors.append(computed_tensor)
        else:
            # add logic to handle layer that does not support masks
            if input_tensors is None:
                input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=x.shape[1:], dtype=x.dtype) for x in model.outputs]
            output_tensors = [layer.call(input_tensors) for layer in model.layers]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now properly compute the output tensors even when dealing with multiple inputs and outputs, along with layers that do not support masks. This should resolve the `AssertionError` mentioned in the GitHub issue.
