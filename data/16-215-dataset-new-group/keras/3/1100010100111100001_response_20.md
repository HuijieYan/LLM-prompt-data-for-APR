The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is causing the AssertionError when trying to assert that all model outputs have been computed. The issue stems from the incorrect construction of the model cloning process when handling multiple output layers.

The current implementation fails to handle the multiple outputs of the model correctly, leading to missing Tensor mappings and an incomplete model construction. This discrepancy results in an assertion error when validating the model's outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle models with multiple output layers by ensuring that all output tensors are accounted for in the mapping process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Check that all tensors have been mapped
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x not in tensor_map:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ', x)

    return Model(input_tensors, [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs], name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version, we iterate through all the output tensors of the model and ensure that they are available in the `tensor_map`. If any output tensor is missing from the map, a ValueError is raised, indicating that the output could not be computed. This ensures that all model outputs are properly handled and mapped during the model cloning process.
