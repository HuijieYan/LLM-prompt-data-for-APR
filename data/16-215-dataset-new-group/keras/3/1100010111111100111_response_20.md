## Correction

The issue seems to be related to handling the multiple outputs from a Keras model when using `clone_model`, particularly when a layer with multiple outputs and no mask support is involved. This causes the error because the `compute_mask` method always returns `None` due to lack of mask support.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to handle the case of missing masks more gracefully in `_clone_functional_model` and update the tensor map accordingly. Specifically, when the `output_masks` are `None`, this information should be preserved.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    # existing code ...

    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
        if mask is not None:
            tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
        else:
            tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we check if the `mask` is `None` before updating the `tensor_map`. If a mask is available, it is assigned to the corresponding output tensor in the `tensor_map`; otherwise, `None` is preserved as the mask.

This corrected version should handle the multi-output case more gracefully and prevent the "Could not compute output" error.
