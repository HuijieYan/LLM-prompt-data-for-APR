The potential error locations in the provided buggy function are in the sections where the input layers are being created and in the section where the output tensors are being checked, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The issue seems to be related to the clone_model function, and the bug is associated with the computation of output tensors and masks for a model with layers that do not support masks.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where the layer does not support masks.

Here's the corrected version of the function, which includes the fixes based on the GitHub issue:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # function remains the same as before, with some modifications as follows

    # existing code...

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code...
            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # existing code...
            else:
                # existing code...

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # existing code...

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # existing code...
                computed_tensors = [computed_data[i][0] for i in range(len(computed_data))]
                computed_masks = [computed_data[i][1] for i in range(len(computed_data))]

                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                        kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                # Call layer.
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # ignore mask for layers that don't support it

    # remaining code...

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, the code has been updated to properly handle layers that don't support masks. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
