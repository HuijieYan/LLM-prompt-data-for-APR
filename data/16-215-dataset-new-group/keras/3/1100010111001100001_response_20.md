The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance by creating new layers and new weights instead of sharing existing layers and weights. The function defines layer mappings and tensor mappings to recreate the behavior of the original model with newly instantiated weights.

The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` attempts to create a functional model with multiple outputs, clone it, and compare the predictions from the original model and the cloned model. However, the test fails, indicating that the cloned model does not reproduce the behavior of the original model as expected.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the process of creating placeholders and mapping the input and output tensors as part of cloning the model. It seems that the mappings and tensor creation are not accurately capturing the behavior of the original model.

The cause of the bug can be traced to inaccurate mappings of input tensors, output tensors, and layer references within the `_clone_functional_model` function. This incorrect mapping is affecting the behavior of the cloned model, causing it to produce incorrect predictions compared to the original model.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure accurate recreation of the original model's behavior by correctly mapping the input and output tensors, as well as updating the layers as needed during the cloning process. This may involve revisiting the logic for creating or reusing placeholders, accurately mapping the input and output tensors, and handling multi-output layers. Additionally, the tensor mapping process and the handling of input layers need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that the behavior of the original model is faithfully reproduced in the cloned model.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.output_shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]
    
    layer_map = {}
    for layer in model.layers:
        config = layer.get_config()
        cloned_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(config)
        layer_map[layer] = cloned_layer

    all_inputs = [layer.input for layer in model.layers if hasattr(layer, 'input')]
    all_outputs = [layer.output for layer in model.layers if hasattr(layer, 'output')]
    from_output_to_input = {}
    for ii, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
        for node in layer._inbound_nodes:
            input_tensors = [layer_map[lay].output for lay in node.inbound_layers]
            if len(input_tensors) == 1:
                input_tensors = input_tensors[0]
            elif len(input_tensors) == 0:
                input_tensors = []
            from_output_to_input[layer_map[layer.output]] = input_tensors
            
    new_output_tensors = [from_output_to_input[out] for out in all_outputs]
    
    return Model(input_tensors, new_output_tensors)
```

With these corrections, the `_clone_functional_model` function should accurately recreate the behavior of the original model, allowing the failing test to pass.
