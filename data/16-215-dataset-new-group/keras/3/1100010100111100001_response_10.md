The bug in the given function is causing an assertion error during the runtime of the failing test. The failing test case is trying to clone a functional `Model` instance with multiple outputs, and the assertion error occurs due to the inability to compute the output tensors in the cloned model. 

The cause of the bug is related to the way input tensors are being handled in the function, particularly when the layer contains multiple input tensors. The cloning process is not properly mapping the input tensors from the original model to the corresponding input tensors in the cloned model.

To fix the bug, the function `_clone_functional_model` needs to be modified to correctly handle the input tensors and their corresponding mappings during the cloning process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Create placeholders to build the model on top of
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers]

    # Build the model on top of the provided input tensors
    outputs = model(input_tensors)
    return Model(input_tensors, outputs, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected version, the function correctly handles the input tensors and creates a new model based on the provided inputs. This ensures that the cloned model will have the correct input mappings and should resolve the failing test case.
