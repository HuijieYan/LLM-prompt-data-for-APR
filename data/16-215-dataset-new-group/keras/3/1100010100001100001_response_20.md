The bug in the provided function is likely causing a failure when the function is called with specific input parameters. Based on the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the function is failing to properly clone a functional model due to issues with the handling of input tensors and layers.

The potential error locations within the buggy function can be found in the section that handles the creation and mapping of input layers, as well as the iteration over nodes in the reference model.

The bug in the function is likely caused by incorrect handling of input tensors and layers, leading to issues in cloning the model and properly computing output tensors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly create placeholders for input layers, properly handle the creation and mapping of input layers and tensors, and iterate over nodes in the reference model to effectively clone the model with newly instantiated weights.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]

    # Map input tensors to input layers
    layer_map = {layer: input_tensor for layer, input_tensor in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors)}

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    for depth in sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.keys(), reverse=True):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    # Build a dictionary to map input_tensors to input_layers
    tensor_map = {input_tensor: layer_map[input_layer] for input_tensor, input_layer in zip(input_tensors, model._input_layers)}

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[output] for output in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, the function first creates placeholders for input layers and correctly maps input tensors to input layers. Then, it iterates over the nodes in the reference model to clone the layers and build a dictionary to map input tensors to input layers. Finally, it checks and computes the model outputs before instantiating a new model from the inputs and outputs.
