The potential error locations within the given buggy function are as follows:
1. Inconsistent usage of input_layers and input_tensors
2. Incorrect mapping when creating input_tensor

The cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent creation and mapping of input_tensors and input_layers in the function. This results in the incorrect handling of input_tensors and input_layers, which leads to unexpected behavior when cloning the model.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the input_tensors and input_layers are correctly handled and mapped when creating the model. This includes properly creating input_tensors and mapping them to their corresponding input_layers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (rest of the function code)

    input_layers = model._input_layers
    input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors) if input_tensors is not None else [None] * len(input_layers)

    # Create the input placeholders to build the model on top of
    placeholders = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]

    # Create a mapping between original input layers and the newly created placeholders
    layer_map = dict(zip(input_layers, placeholders))

    # Re-map the input tensors to use the created placeholders
    input_tensors = [layer_map[l] if x is None else x for l, x in zip(input_layers, input_tensors)]

    # ... (rest of the function code)
```

This corrected version ensures that the input tensors and input layers are correctly handled and mapped, addressing the issues identified in the original function.
