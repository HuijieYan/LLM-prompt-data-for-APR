The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the cloning process of the functional model due to incorrect handling of the input tensors and their corresponding layers. The runtime analysis reveals that the function is not correctly propagating the input tensors and their corresponding layers, which leads to incorrect layer and tensor mappings.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to ensure that the input tensors and their corresponding layers are properly handled and mapped throughout the cloning process. Additionally, the computation and handling of the output tensors and masks should be carefully reviewed to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
    else:
        # Map input tensors to their corresponding layers.
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                input_tensors[i] = input_tensor
                layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
    
    # Recursively clone the layers in the model, ensuring correct mappings between original and new layers.
    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
        for i in range(len(layer.inbound_nodes)):
            node = layer.inbound_nodes[i]
            for orig_input, new_input in zip(node.input_tensors, node.input_tensors):
                tensor_map[orig_input] = (new_input, None)  # tensor, mask
    
    # Map the output tensors of the model to their corresponding cloned tensors.
    for orig_output in model.outputs:
        output_tensor = tensor_map[orig_output][0]
        tensor_map[orig_output] = (output_tensor, None)
    
    # Construct the new model using the mapped input and output tensors.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[output][0] for output in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version:
1. The input and output tensors are correctly mapped to their corresponding layers and cloned tensors.
2. The model's layers, along with their inbound nodes, are recursively cloned and mapped to ensure the correct relationships between original and new layers.
3. The output tensors of the model are correctly mapped to their corresponding cloned tensors.

By making these changes, the function should now be able to perform the cloning of functional models correctly, ensuring that new layers are created and weights are properly instantiated.
