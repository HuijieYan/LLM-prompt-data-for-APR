The bug is occurring in the `_clone_functional_model` function of the `keras/models.py` file. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement at line 166 is failing, meaning that the output tensors from the original model are not being computed correctly in the clone model.

After analyzing the function, it seems that the bug could be related to the proper handling of input and output tensors, as well as the cloning of layers.

It appears that the issue stems from the handling of input tensors in the `_clone_functional_model` function. When creating the new input tensors if `input_tensors` is not provided, the `input_layers` list is initialized as an empty list, but it is not used to store the placeholder layers.

To fix the bug, it's important to properly create the placeholder layers and ensure that they are added to the `input_layers` list for subsequent usage.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(input_tensor)  # Add the placeholder to the list
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer

        # Updated the loop with input_layers
        for _original, _cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
            layer_map[_original] = _cloned

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By ensuring that the `input_layers` list is properly populated with the placeholder layers, this fixes the bug and ensures that the clone model will compute the output tensors correctly.
