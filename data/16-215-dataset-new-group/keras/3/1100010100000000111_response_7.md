## Analysis:
The issue is related to the `clone_model` function in Keras, specifically to do with issues around layer cloning, mask support, and computing output tensors.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The line `for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors`. This may be where the issue with not being able to compute output tensors is occurring.
2. The line `output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(` where the output_masks are always being set to None due to a lack of mask support for certain layers.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the inability to compute output tensors for certain layers that do not support masks, which is causing the `clone_model` function to fail when trying to clone the model.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Check for layer mask support and handle the case where layers do not support masks.
2. Ensure that the output_tensors and output_masks are being computed correctly for all layers, including those without mask support.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python

    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:

                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of input_tensors and the computation of output_tensors have been adjusted to ensure that layers without mask support are correctly handled, and the model can be successfully cloned.
