### Analysis
The problematic function `_clone_functional_model` seems to be intended to create a clone of a functional `Model` instance. The function is meant to create new layers with new weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect instance type checking: There might be issues with checking the instance types of the model.
2. Incorrect caching of input data: The process of caching input data and creating new input layers may have issues.
3. Handling of reference_model nodes: The loop for iterating over every node in the reference model might not work as intended.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function causes issues with the cloning of the functional model, resulting in an incorrect clone of the original model. The incorrect type checking and layer caching can lead to the creation of a model with shared weights instead of new weights.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that new layers with new weights are created instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. This can be done by effectively caching input data, ensuring correct layer type checking, and properly handling the nodes of the reference model.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.output_shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers]

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
    
    for original_input, new_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_input] = new_input
        tensor_map[original_input] = new_input

    for layer in model.layers:
        cloned_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = cloned_layer
        for orig_input, new_input in zip(layer.input, cloned_layer.input):
            tensor_map[orig_input] = new_input
            layer_map[orig_input] = new_input
        for orig_output, new_output in zip(layer.output, cloned_layer.output):
            tensor_map[orig_output] = new_output
            layer_map[orig_output] = new_output

    inputs = [layer_map[x] for x in model.inputs]

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]

    return Model(inputs, output_tensors, name='cloned_' + model.name)
```

The corrected version of the function utilizes a more straightforward approach for cloning the functional model, ensuring that new layers with new weights are created. The input tensors are created using the input shape of the original model's layers, and the mapping of input and output tensors is handled appropriately during the cloning process. The corrected version is intended to improve the accuracy and robustness of the functional model cloning.
