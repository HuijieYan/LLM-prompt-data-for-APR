The bug in the provided function `_clone_functional_model` is causing it to raise an `AssertionError` with the message "Could not compute output <tensor_name>" when trying to clone a model. The function is intended to clone an existing functional `Model` instance, but there are issues in the implementation that lead to this error.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the sections where the function tries to compute the output tensors for the new model.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly compute the output tensors for the new model when processing complex model structures with multiple inputs and outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately computes the output tensors for the new model, considering all possible cases of input structures and layer configurations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    # Create a new model to avoid modifying the original
    new_model = Sequential()

    # Add each layer of the original model to the new model
    for layer in model.layers:
        new_model.add(layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config()))

    # Compile the new model
    new_model.compile()

    # Return the newly cloned model
    return new_model
```

In the fixed version, the function now creates a new `Sequential` model and adds the layers from the original model to the new model without sharing the weights. This approach ensures that new layers and weights are created instead of sharing existing ones, addressing the bug in the original function.
