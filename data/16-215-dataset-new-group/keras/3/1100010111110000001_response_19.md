The `clone_model` function is failing with an `AssertionError` due to a bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function in the Keras library. This issue is causing the `assert` statement to fail in the `clone_model` function. The error message indicates that the output tensor cannot be computed for a certain layer.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input layers, caching input layers, and computing the output tensors for the model cloning process. The issue may be due to the incorrect handling of the input tensors and their associated layers during the cloning process.

To fix this bug, the handling of input tensor caching and the computation of output tensors needs to be carefully revised. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the layers are properly cloned and the associations between input and output tensors are correctly mapped during the cloning process.

Here's a corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function based on the analysis given above:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor  # Associate original layer with the newly created input tensor
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[i].name
                input_tensor = Input(tensor=x,
                                     name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
                layer_map[model._input_layers[i]] = input_tensor  # Associate original input layer with the newly created input tensor

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Associate input tensors with corresponding tensors and mask
    
    # ... (remaining parts of the function)

    # Corrected section for checking computed model outputs
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
            output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            # Handle the case where the output tensor cannot be computed
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ', x)
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected version addresses the handling of input layers and the mapping of input and output tensors during the model cloning process. This should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
