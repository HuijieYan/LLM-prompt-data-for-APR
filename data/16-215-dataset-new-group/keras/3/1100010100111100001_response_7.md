The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function occurs because the function checks if the input `model` is an instance of `Sequential` after already checking if it is an instance of `Model`. This leads to a contradiction as `Sequential` is a subclass of `Model`, causing the function to raise an error even when the input `model` is a valid instance of `Model` (specifically, a functional `Model`).

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the redundant check for `Sequential` and only check if the input `model` is an instance of `Model`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to correctly clone a functional `Model` instance without raising an error unnecessarily.
