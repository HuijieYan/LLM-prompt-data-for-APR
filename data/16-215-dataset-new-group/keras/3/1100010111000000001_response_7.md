The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is that it is not handling the inputs and outputs correctly when cloning the model. This is causing the failing test to fail because the cloned model is not producing the same outputs as the original model.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the input tensors and the output tensors when creating the cloned model.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when creating the cloned model, the input tensors and output tensors are handled correctly so that the behavior of the original model is accurately reproduced.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
from keras.engine import topology

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    clone_map = {}
    layer_weights = {}  # Cache for layer weights.
    
    # Clone the input layers
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(tensor=K.placeholder(shape=shape, dtype=dtype))
                         for shape, dtype in zip(model.input_shape, model.input_dtype)]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
        layer_configs = topology.Layer.get_config(layer)
        new_layer = topology.Layer.from_config(layer_configs)
        clone_map[layer] = new_layer
        
        # Get the layer weights
        weights = layer.get_weights()
        layer_weights[layer] = weights

    # Get the output tensor(s)
    x = input_tensors
    for layer in model.layers:
        x = clone_map[layer](x, **kwargs)
        
    cloned_model = Model(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=x, name=model.name)
    
    # Set the layer weights
    for layer in cloned_model.layers:
        if layer in layer_weights:
            layer.set_weights(layer_weights[layer])

    return cloned_model
```

In the corrected version, we create a `clone_map` to map the original layers to their cloned counterparts and a `layer_weights` cache to store the weights of each layer. We then iterate through the layers of the original model, create new layers with the same configurations, and apply the layers to the input tensors to build the cloned model. Finally, we set the weights of the cloned layers to match the original model.

With the corrected `_clone_functional_model` function, the failing test should now pass as the cloned model will accurately reproduce the behavior of the original model.
