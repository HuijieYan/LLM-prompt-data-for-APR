The cause of the bug is that the variable `input_layers` is not being assigned any value during the execution of the function, and there is an attempt to use it in the following section of the code:
```python
for _original, _cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
    layer_map[_original] = _cloned
```
Since `input_layers` is an empty list, the function encounters an error when trying to access its elements as it iterates through the zip statement. 

To fix this bug, we need to populate the `input_layers` list with the appropriate values to match the length of `model._input_layers` before reaching the zip statement. We can achieve this by appending the cloned input layers to the `input_layers` list as they are created.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (unchanged code)

    input_layers = []  # Create an empty list to store the cloned input layers
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            newly_created_input_layer = input_tensor._keras_history[0]
            layer_map[layer] = newly_created_input_layer
            input_layers.append(newly_created_input_layer)  # Append the newly created input layer to input_layers

    for _original, _cloned in zip(model._input_layers, input_layers):
        layer_map[_original] = _cloned

    # ... (unchanged code)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
``` 

In the corrected version, a new input_layers list is created and the newly created input layers are appended to this list. This ensures that input_layers always matches the length of model._input_layers, fixing the bug.
