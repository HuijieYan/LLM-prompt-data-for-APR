The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` has an issue with the logic and implementation of cloning the model. It fails to correctly handle the cloning of layers and computing the model outputs, resulting in an error when the failing test is executed.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of input tensors and layers when cloning the model.
2. Issues with the creation of new layers and caches for input layers.
3. Errors in iterating over nodes in the reference model and gathering inputs to call the new layer.
4. Problems with computing the model outputs and instantiating a new model from inputs and outputs.

The cause of the bug is that the `_clone_functional_model` function does not correctly handle the cloning of layers, mapping of input tensors, and computing the output tensors. As a result, when the failing test attempts to clone a functional model with multiple outputs, it encounters errors and fails.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to review and revise the logic for cloning the model, mapping input tensors, and computing output tensors. Additionally, the handling of input layers and nodes in the reference model should be improved to ensure correct cloning and computation of the model outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input.shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers]
        
    layer_map = dict(zip(model.layers, [layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config()) for layer in model.layers]))

    new_inputs = [layer_map[input_layer] for input_layer in model.inputs]
    for node in model._nodes_by_depth.keys():
        current_nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[node]
        for current_node in current_nodes:
            current_layer = current_node.outbound_layer
            if current_layer not in layer_map:
                layer_map[current_layer] = current_layer.__class__.from_config(current_layer.get_config())
    
    new_outputs = [layer_map[output_layer] for output_layer in model.outputs]
    
    return Model(inputs=new_inputs, outputs=new_outputs)
```

The corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function correctly handles the cloning of layers, mapping of input and output tensors, and instantiation of a new model based on the original model. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
