The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is intended to clone a functional `Model` instance. However, the issue seems to be caused by the inability of the function to handle multiple outputs from a single layer, due to the absence of a mask support for certain layers.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to modify the function to properly handle multiple outputs from a single layer, specifically, by accounting for the absence of output masks for layers that do not support masks.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.keys(), reverse=True):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors

            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_data))
                for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version:
- Iteration over nodes and layers is refactored to handle multiple outputs properly.
- The `mask` support check is removed to allow layers without mask support to be handled correctly.

This should resolve the issue and allow the `clone_model` function to work properly with models containing multiple outputs from a single layer.
