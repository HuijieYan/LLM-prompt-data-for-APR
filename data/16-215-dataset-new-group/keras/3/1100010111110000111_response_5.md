The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is causing an `AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)` when using the `clone_model` method. In the GitHub issue, a similar error is reported when using `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling layers with multiple outputs properly, and there is an issue with the creation and mapping of tensor and mask information.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a layer has multiple outputs, the tensor and mask information are properly mapped and used. Additionally, the creation and caching of input layers need to be managed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_layers = []
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model._input_layers:
            input_tensor = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                 dtype=layer.dtype,
                                 sparse=layer.sparse,
                                 name=layer.name)
            input_layers.append(layer)
            input_tensors.append(input_tensor)
            # Cache newly created input layer.
            layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for layer in model.layers:
        layer_input_tensors = [tensor_map[node] for node in layer._inbound_nodes]
        new_tensors = [layer_map[node.outbound_layer] for node in layer._inbound_nodes]

        for x, y in zip(layer_input_tensors, new_tensors):
            tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model([tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.inputs], output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that all input layers are properly mapped, and the mapping of tensor and mask information is correctly handled for layers with multiple inputs and outputs. This should resolve the issue and make the function work as expected.
