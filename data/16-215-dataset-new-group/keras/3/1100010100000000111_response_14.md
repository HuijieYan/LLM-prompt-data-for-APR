The bug in the `clone_model` function is causing an error related to the inability to compute the output tensor, particularly in cases where a layer with multiple outputs without mask support is used. This bug results in the `clone_model` function not correctly handling the output masks, causing it to always return `None`. This issue is confirmed by the GitHub issue titled "Could not compute output Tensor" which provides a script to reproduce the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `clone_model` function to properly handle cases where the layer.compute_mask returns `None`. This may involve modifying the logic for handling the `output_masks` and checking if the `output_masks` are `None`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the tensor_map is properly updated to compute the model outputs.

Here is the corrected version of the function taking into account the information from the GitHub issue:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same function definition)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (same code for recovering the layer and computing the output tensors)

            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}
            if len(computed_data) == 1:
                computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
            else:
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and computed_masks != [None]:
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Only update the tensor_map with the computed tensors, masks not handled

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the logic for handling the `computed_masks` and updating the `tensor_map`. We are also handling the case where `computed_masks` may be `None` and only updating the `tensor_map` with the computed tensors, since masks are not handled in this function. This update should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
