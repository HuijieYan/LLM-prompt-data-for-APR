The bug in the _clone_functional_model function is causing the failing test to raise a ValueError. The bug is most likely in the section where the function tries to create or reuse layers for the new model. 

Upon analysis of the failing test and the corresponding error message, it seems like the issue arises when trying to reproduce the behavior of the original model on top of new input tensors using newly instantiated weights. The error message indicates that the model's output tensor could not be computed.

To fix this bug, you can revise the code in the section responsible for creating or reusing layers for the new model, as well as the part where the input tensors are handled.

Here's a corrected version of the _clone_functional_model function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance')

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in model.input_layers]

    for original, cloned in zip(model.input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original] = cloned
        tensor_map[original.input] = (cloned, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.keys(), reverse=True):
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                new_layer = layer_map[layer]

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            computed_data = [tensor_map[x] for x in reference_input_tensors if x in tensor_map]

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                output_tensors = to_list(new_layer(computed_data[0][0]))
                tensor_map[node.output_tensors[0]] = (output_tensors[0], None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We iteratively create the input tensors for the new model based on the original model's input layers.
2. We then map the original model's input tensors to the corresponding newly created input tensors.
3. We traverse the nodes of the original model in a reverse order, creating or reusing layers and computing the output tensors for the new model.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
