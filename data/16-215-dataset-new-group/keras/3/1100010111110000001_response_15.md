The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is causing it to fail when trying to clone a functional model with multiple outputs. The error message indicates that it could not compute the output for the `swap_layer_1` tensor.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle models with multiple outputs correctly. When attempting to compute the output tensors for the cloned model, the function fails to process the multiple output scenario, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle multiple output scenarios and ensure that all output tensors are properly computed and added to the `tensor_map`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
            output_tensors.append(tensor)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ' + str(x))  # Handle case where output tensor is not computed

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through all output tensors of the model and check if each output tensor is present in the `tensor_map`. If any output tensor is not found in the map, we raise a ValueError to indicate that the output could not be computed.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle models with multiple outputs and properly compute the output tensors. This should address the failing test and resolve the assertion error.
