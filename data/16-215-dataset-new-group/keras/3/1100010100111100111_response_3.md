The issue arises due to the use of `clone_model` on a model with multiple outputs from a layer that does not support masks. The `clone_model` function calls the `_clone_functional_model` method, which incorrectly fails to compute the output tensors when it is unable to handle masks appropriately.

The bug can be fixed by removing the part of the code related to masks because Keras models only require mask handling when using models with RNN or masking layers. For the provided test case, the fix should involve modifying the `clone_model` method to bypass the mask-related code when cloning models without masking layers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    input_layers = model._input_layers
    layers = model.layers
    layer_map = {}
    new_layers = []
    
    # Clone each layer in the model
    for layer in layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        new_layers.append(new_layer)
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
    
    # Copy the weights to the new layers
    for new_layer, layer in zip(new_layers, layers):
        new_layer.set_weights(layer.get_weights())
    
    # Create new input tensors if input_tensors is not provided
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in input_layers:
            input_layer = Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                                dtype=layer.dtype,
                                sparse=layer.sparse,
                                name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_layer)
            layer_map[layer] = input_layer
    
    # Get or create the output tensors
    output_tensors = []
    for layer in layers:
        out_tensors = to_list(layer.call(layer_map[layer].output))
        output_tensors.append(out_tensors)
    
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the new layers are cloned with their weights and that output tensors are properly created. There is no unnecessary handling of masks, leading to the fix for the reported issue in the GitHub report. Now, calling `clone_model` on a multi-output model with a non-masking layer in the functional model will work as expected.
