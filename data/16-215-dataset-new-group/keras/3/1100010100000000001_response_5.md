The potential error in the buggy function is that:
- It checks if the input `model` is an instance of the `Model` class but then tries to handle `Sequential` instances differently, which might lead to the function raising an exception when it should handle `Sequential` instances differently.

The cause of the bug is that the code incorrectly handles `Sequential` instances differently from other instances of `Model`, leading to potential errors and incorrect behavior. 

To fix the bug, the strategy is to handle `Sequential` instances in a consistent manner with other instances of `Model` by distinguishing their behavior before any conditional checks are made.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in model.input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)

    layer_map = {}
    tensor_map = {}
  
    for layer, input_tensor in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[layer] = input_tensor

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            # Clone layer.
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer
        else:
            # Reuse previously cloned layer.
            layer = layer_map[layer]
            if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                continue

        input_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in layer.input_tensors]
        kwargs = layer.arguments if layer.arguments else {}
        if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
            kwargs['mask'] = [tensor_map[x][1] for x in layer.input_tensors]

        output_tensors = to_list(layer(input_tensors, **kwargs))
        output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(input_tensors, [tensor_map[x][1] for x in layer.input_tensors]))

        for index, x in enumerate(layer.output_tensors):
            tensor_map[x] = (output_tensors[index], output_masks[index])

    return Model(input_tensors, [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs], name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that `Sequential` instances are handled consistently with other models. The input tensors are correctly created or passed as input, and the cloning process iterates through layers based on the model's layer structure. This approach ensures consistent behavior and avoids unnecessary complexity.
