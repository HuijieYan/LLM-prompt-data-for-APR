The potential error locations within the buggy function are identified in the `clone_functional_model` function, particularly in the section where it iterates over nodes in the reference model and processes the input and output tensors. The issue mentioned in the GitHub post involves the inability to compute the output tensors for the cloned model, which is due to the `output_masks` always being `[None]` when using a layer that does not support masks.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to check for the existence of masks and handle the case where a layer does not support masks. This can be done by adding a conditional check before computing the output masks, and adjusting the subsequent logic accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing function definition) ...

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        if mask is not None and hasattr(model, 'compute_mask'):
            output_masks = model.compute_mask(tensor, mask)
        else:
            output_masks = None
        output_tensors.append(tensor)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the mask is not None and if the model has the `compute_mask` attribute before computing the masks for the output tensors. This ensures that we handle the case where a layer does not support masks and prevents the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.
