### Analysis
The `_clone_functional_model` function is used to clone a functional `Model` instance. The GitHub issue revealed that when using `clone_model`, it raised an assertion error: "Could not compute output Tensor." The issue was related to a layer with multiple outputs without mask support. The issue posted provides a script that reproduces the bug and suggests that the `output_masks` will always be `[None]` instead of the expected `[None, None]`.

### Identified Bug
The bug appears to be related to the way `output_masks` are handled when a layer with multiple outputs without mask support is encountered. This leads to the 'Could not compute output Tensor' error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `output_masks` are computed for layers with multiple outputs. Specifically, when `layer.compute_mask` returns `None`, the code should handle it correctly to avoid the assertion error.

### Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:
```python
# The corrected function of the buggy function

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (same as the original function)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs, then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    out_mask = None
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
        if mask is not None:
            if out_mask is None:
                out_mask = [mask]
            else:
                out_mask.append(mask)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name, output_mask=out_mask)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for handling `output_masks` in the loop that gathers the output tensors. When the `mask` is not `None`, it is added to the `out_mask` list, which is then passed to the `Model` constructor as the `output_mask`. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the function work correctly with layers having multiple outputs without mask support.
