The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` has several error locations:

1. There is no need to check if `model` is an instance of `Model` because the function signature mentions it as a mandatory argument.
2. There is a bug in the code where input_layers and input_tensors are being initialized.
3. The way tensor_map is populated and used is not helping to perform the operations correctly.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug involves following these steps:
1. Remove the type check for `model` since it's mentioned as a mandatory argument.
2. Initialize `input_layers` and `input_tensors` correctly when `input_tensors` is None.
3. Rewrite the logic for populating `tensor_map` and using it for performing operations accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_input_shape=layer.input_shape, name=layer.name) for layer in model.layers]
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: corresponding_tensor}

    # Iterate over the layers and link the input and output tensors
    for layer in model.layers:
        for i in range(len(layer.inbound_nodes)):
            for x in layer.inbound_nodes[i].input_tensors:
