The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function arises from the incorrect handling of multi-output layers and the generation of input layers. This results in incorrect output tensors and does not successfully clone the model. The issue on GitHub further suggests that this bug occurs when using multi_gpu_model with `cpu_relocation=True` and when using a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support.

To fix the bug, we need to make changes to how input layers are created and how multi-output layers are handled to ensure that the model is correctly cloned with the appropriate input and output tensors. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    
    # Check if model is a Sequential model
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    input_layers = model.inputs
    if input_tensors:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for i, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                wrap_layer = InputLayer(input_tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + input_layers[i].name)
                input_layers[i] = wrap_layer

    reference_output_tensors = model(input_layers)
    
    return Model(input_layers, reference_output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We check if the input tensors are provided and update the input layers accordingly.
2. We call the model on the input layers to get the reference output tensors.
3. Finally, we return a new model with the updated input and output layers.

By making these changes, we ensure that the model is correctly cloned with the appropriate input and output tensors, fixing the bug and resolving the GitHub issue.
