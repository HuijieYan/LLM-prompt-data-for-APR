The bug occurs in the function `_clone_functional_model` in the file `keras/models.py`. The function attempts to clone a functional `Model` instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The function is failing when used with the test function `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` in the file `tests/keras/test_sequential_model.py`.

The specific error message indicates that the function is unable to compute the output for a certain tensor, causing an assertion error.

The potential location for the error is when the function iterates over every node in the reference model. It gathers inputs to call the new layer and attempts to compute the output for each tensor. If it fails to compute the output for any tensor, it raises an assertion error.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to refactor the logic of computing the output tensors and masks to ensure that the function can correctly compute the model outputs. This may involve revisiting the cloning logic and the handling of input and output tensors.

The corrected version of the function may look as follows:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other lines of the function)

    # End of the function remains the same

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    computed_output_tensors, computed_output_masks = [], []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x in tensor_map:
            tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
            computed_output_tensors.append(tensor)
            computed_output_masks.append(mask)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output for tensor:', x)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to generate the output tensors correctly without raising an assertion error. This should make the test function `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` pass successfully.
