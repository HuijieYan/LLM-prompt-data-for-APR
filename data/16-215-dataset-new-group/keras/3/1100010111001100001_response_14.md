The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is most likely due to incorrect handling of the input layers and input tensors when cloning a functional model. The main issue seems to be related to the creation and mapping of input tensors and input layers, which results in incorrect references and mappings during the cloning process.

The function tries to create placeholders for building the model when `input_tensors` is not provided, but the creation and mapping of the input layers and tensors are not consistent, leading to incorrect references and mappings.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the creation and mapping of input layers and input tensors are done correctly, and that the references are mapped properly for the cloning process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    input_layers = []
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = []
        for layer in model.inputs:
            input_layer = Input(batch_shape=layer.shape, dtype=layer.dtype, name=layer.name)
            input_tensors.append(input_layer)
            input_layers.append(input_layer)

    for layer in model.inputs:
        input_layers.append(layer)

    layer_map = {}
    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    tensor_map = {x: y for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors)}

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            layer_map[layer] = layer

    for node in model.nodes:
        outbound_layer = node.outbound_layer
        if outbound_layer not in layer_map:
            new_outbound_layer = outbound_layer.__class__.from_config(outbound_layer.get_config())
            layer_map[outbound_layer] = new_outbound_layer

    for node in model.nodes:
        outbound_layer = node.outbound_layer
        reference_input_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in node.input_tensors]
        computed_data = [(x, None) for x in reference_input_tensors]

        for x in computed_data:
            tensor_map[x[0]] = x

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the creation and mapping of input layers and input tensors correctly, ensuring that the cloning process reproduces the behavior of the original model. This should address the issues observed in the failing test.
