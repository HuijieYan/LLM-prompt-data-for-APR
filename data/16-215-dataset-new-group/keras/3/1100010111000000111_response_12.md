The bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function is likely related to the handling of multiple inputs and outputs, specifically when calling a layer with multiple inputs and outputs without mask support.

The bug seems to be causing an error related to the inability to compute the output tensor when using `clone_model()` on a functional model with a layer that has more outputs without mask support.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the `_clone_functional_model` function to correctly handle layers with multiple inputs and outputs, especially in cases where the layer does not support mask computation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code from the original function)

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors

            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}
            output_tensors = to_list(
                layer(reference_input_tensors, **kwargs))

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = y

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The changes made to the function include directly using all reference input tensors for the new layer call, instead of computing the mask and handling multiple input/output cases specifically within the loop. This should address the bug where the original function failed to properly compute the output tensors and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
