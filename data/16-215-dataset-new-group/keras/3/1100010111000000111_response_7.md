Based on the detected error location and the issue description, I understand that the problem arises from the `output_masks` variable always being set to `None` due to a specific scenario where a layer does not support masks. This causes the "Could not compute output Tensor" error. To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the output_masks are set to `None` correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts remain the same)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]

                # Call layer with input tensors and kwargs.
                if len(computed_tensors) == 1:
                    kwargs['mask'] = None  # Set mask to None if not available
                else:
                    if 'mask' not in kwargs or kwargs['mask'] is None:
                        kwargs['mask'] = [None] * len(computed_tensors)

                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Set mask to None for all output_tensors

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected version, the `mask` for each layer call is specifically handled and set to `None` if not available, as it was identified that the error occurred when the `output_masks` were always `None`. This should resolve the "Could not compute output Tensor" issue.
