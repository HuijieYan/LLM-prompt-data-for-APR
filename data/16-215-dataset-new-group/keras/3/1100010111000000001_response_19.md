### Analysis:
The `_clone_functional_model` function is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance. It creates new layers (and new weights) instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The `for` loop to gather inputs to call the new layer seems to be incorrectly indexing if all previous input tensors are available in `tensor_map`.
2. The problem might be related to the iteration over every node in the reference model, in depth order. There might be incorrect handling of the layers and their connections.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the input and output tensors in the `_clone_functional_model` function. This might be leading to incorrect cloning and reuse of layers, resulting in an incorrect cloned model.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Carefully review the iteration over every node in the reference model and ensure that the layers and their connections are correctly handled.
2. Review the logic for gathering inputs to call the new layer and ensure that the indexing and processing of tensors is correct.

### Bug-fix for the `_clone_functional_model` function:
```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... existing function code ...

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x not in tensor_map:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output ', x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The fix involves adding a specific check for each output tensor to ensure that it has been computed and exists in the `tensor_map`. If not, it raises a `ValueError` indicating the issue. This ensures that the model outputs are correctly computed before instantiating a new model from inputs and outputs.

### Test Function Behavior:
Once this fixing is done, the provided test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` should pass successfully.
