The potential issues in the buggy function are:

1. Incorrect checking for the model instance type.
2. The code is prone to errors for checking the type of the model.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect validation of the model type. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the model instance type. When validating the type of the model, the code is not dealing with the Sequential model instance effectively, leading to potential inconsistencies or errors.

To fix the bug:
1. Validate the model types effectively based on the Keras Model types.
2. Replace isinstance check for the Sequential model with isinstance(model, Sequential).

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, the `Sequential` model check is replaced with `isinstance(model, Sequential)` to effectively handle both the functional and sequential model instances. This should address the potential issues in the original implementation.
