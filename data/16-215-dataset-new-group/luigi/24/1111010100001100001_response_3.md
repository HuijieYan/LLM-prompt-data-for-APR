The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the input dictionary correctly when constructing the command list. The function should iterate through the key-value pairs of the dictionary and construct the command list accordingly.

The bug is caused by the use of the variable name inside the for loop, which overwrites the input parameter name. This results in incorrect command construction.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter name. Additionally, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # using a different variable name 'val'
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

This version of the function correctly constructs the command list by iterating through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and avoiding overwriting the input parameter name.
