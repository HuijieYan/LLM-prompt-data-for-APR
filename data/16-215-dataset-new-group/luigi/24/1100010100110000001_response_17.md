The buggy function `_dict_arg` is expected to return a list `command` based on the `value` and `name` provided. The function checks if the `value` exists and is of type `dict`, and if so, it appends formatted key-value pairs to the `command` list. However, the function includes the double quotes within the `command` list, which leads to an error during the tests.

To fix the bug, the function should append the key-value pairs to the `command` list without including double quotes around the value. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes around the value
    return command
```
