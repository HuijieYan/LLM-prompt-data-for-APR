The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary values into a list of command arguments. The function is mistakenly using the same variable name 'value' for the loop iteration, which causes the value to be overwritten and results in the incorrect formatting of command arguments.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to prevent the overwriting of the original 'value' variable. Additionally, the function should properly format the dictionary key-value pairs into the expected format for the command arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name 'val' for the loop iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Properly format the dictionary key-value pairs
    return command
```

With this correction, the _dict_arg function should now properly format the dictionary values into a list of command arguments, and the failing test cases should pass.
