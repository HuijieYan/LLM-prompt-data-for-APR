The buggy function _dict_arg has an issue with reusing the variable name within the for loop. Since the variable name is being used for both the property name and the value, it causes a conflict and unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the value variable inside the for loop to avoid the conflict:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the variable value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variable inside the for loop from value to val, we can eliminate the conflict and fix the bug.
