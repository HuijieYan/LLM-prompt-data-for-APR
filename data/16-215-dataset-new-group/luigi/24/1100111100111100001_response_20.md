The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary values when creating the `command` list. The bug causes the values to be surrounded by double quotes even when they should not be. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary values when constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the `{1}` in the `format` method, we ensure that the dictionary values are not enclosed in quotes when constructing the `command` list. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct command list, passing the failing test cases.
