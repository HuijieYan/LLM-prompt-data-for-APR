The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. The function should be constructing the command list with the correct formatting for each key-value pair in the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the items in the input dictionary and construct the command list using the correct formatting for each key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the _dict_arg function should now properly construct the command list with the correct formatting for each key-value pair in the input dictionary. This should ensure that the failing tests pass and the expected output values are satisfied.
