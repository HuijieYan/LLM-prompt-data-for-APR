The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the function iterates over the input dictionary and appends the key-value pairs to the `command` list with incorrect formatting. The key-value pairs should be formatted as `key=value` without quotes. Additionally, the function is using the same variable name `value` for the inner loop, which is causing a conflict with the outer loop. 

To fix the bug, we need to change the formatting of key-value pairs and use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid conflict.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the inner loop
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, prop_value)]  # Format key-value pairs as key=value
    return command
```

This corrected version will format the key-value pairs correctly and handle the conflict between the outer and inner loop variable names. With this change, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
