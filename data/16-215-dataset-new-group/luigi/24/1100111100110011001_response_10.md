The issue with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly wraps the property and value in double quotes when constructing the command list for a dictionary of properties. This is causing the failing test cases as it expects the properties and values to be without double quotes. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pair when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
