The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it uses the same variable name `value` for the input parameter and the value inside the for loop, which causes unexpected behavior. The correct variable for the for loop should be assigned to a different name to avoid conflicts.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
