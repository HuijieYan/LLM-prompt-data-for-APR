The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is wrapping the property and value in double quotes when creating the command list, which leads to the extra quotes in the output command list. This causes the failing test cases as the quotes are not expected in the output.

To fix this bug, the function should not wrap the property and value in double quotes when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from the value pair when creating the command list, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
