## The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fixed the formatting of the command
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list. The function is expected to create a command list to be used in a subprocess call, but it incorrectly formats the property-value pairs. It was using the wrong formatting with double quotes and equal sign, which doesn't match the expected format for the subprocess call.

To fix the bug, the corrected function preserves the `name`, and updates the formatting for the command list within the loop. It now uses `--{prop}={val}` formatting to correctly represent the command for subprocess call.

The corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
