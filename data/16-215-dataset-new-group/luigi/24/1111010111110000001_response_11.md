## Analysis
The `test_run` test case appears to test the `SparkSubmitTask` and fails with an assertion error. The assertion error details that the lists differ, and the differing element is related to `conf` values.

The `test_defaults` test case also fails with an assertion error. The assertion error details that the lists differ, and the differing element is related to `conf` values.

The cause of the error appears to be with the `value` format in the `_dict_arg` function inside the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The current implementation of `_dict_arg` function generates command for `dict`-like value and this seems to be faulty for the provided tests, especially for `conf` property.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to behaviorally differentiate the `prop` values in the `_dict_arg` function, based on whether they are the `conf` property values or not, and format them accordingly in the resultant command.

## The corrected version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The corrected class
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    # The corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, pvalue in value.items():
                # Modified the command generation to differentiate the formatting of prop values
                if prop == 'conf':
                    command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, pvalue)]  # don't wrap prop in quotes
                else:
                    command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, pvalue)]  # wrap prop in quotes
        return command
```
The corrected implementation of the `_dict_arg` function accounts for the special formatting needed for `conf` values and separates them from other property values. This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
