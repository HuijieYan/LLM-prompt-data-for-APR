The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not correctly formatting the command list when iterating through the dictionary items. The bug causes the command list to be incorrectly formatted, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _dict_arg function to properly iterate through the dictionary items and format the command list correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from value to val to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Updated formatting to use '--' and removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

In the corrected version, I changed the formatting of the command list to use '--{prop}={val}' format and renamed the variable inside the loop to avoid confusion with the function parameter. This change ensures that the command list is correctly formatted for the test cases to pass.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values and types for the failing test cases described. It correctly formats the command list for the given dictionary input, which aligns with the expected command lists in the failing test cases.
