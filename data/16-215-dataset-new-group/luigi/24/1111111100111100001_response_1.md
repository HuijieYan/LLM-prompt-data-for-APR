The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the extra quotes around the property value when the function constructs the command list. This results in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the property value in the command list construction.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the variable to avoid shadowing the outer variable
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove extra quotes around the property value
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list without the unnecessary quotes around the property value, fixing the mismatch issue in the failing tests.
