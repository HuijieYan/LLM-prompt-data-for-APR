The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not properly handle the input dictionary `value` and convert it into a list `command` as expected by the test cases. The way it currently handles the dictionary items is incorrect, resulting in the incorrect output.

The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list `command` with formatted strings for each key-value pair. However, it's currently not doing this correctly, resulting in the wrong output.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the dictionary items and properly format them into strings before adding them to the `command` list. Then return the `command` list at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the dictionary items and use `extend` to add the formatted strings to the `command` list. Then we return the `command` list at the end of the function.

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
