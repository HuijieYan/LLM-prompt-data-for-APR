The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable `value` in the loop, which causes it to overwrite the original value passed into the function, resulting in incorrect behavior. 

To fix the bug, the variable name inside the loop can be changed to avoid overwriting the function's input.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
