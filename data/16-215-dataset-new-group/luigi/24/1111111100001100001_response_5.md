The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary. It is not separating the key-value pairs with an equal sign and wrapping them in double quotes as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command in the correct format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version properly constructs the command list by iterating through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary, separating them with an equal sign, and not wrapping them in double quotes.

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle input parameters that are dictionaries and construct the command list accordingly.
