The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name "value" in the for loop, which overwrites the function parameter `value`. This causes the function to use the wrong `value` and `prop` variables.

To fix the bug, we should rename the loop variable from `value` to something else, such as `v`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]
    return command
```
