The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is due to the unnecessary double-quoting of the values in the command list. The expected values in the command list do not have double quotes, so we need to remove them. Additionally, the function is using the variable name `value` in the loop, which is the same name as the input parameter, causing confusion. We will need to rename the variable in the loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

To fix the bug, we will remove the double quotes around the formatted value and change the loop variable name to something else to avoid conflict with the input parameter. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This should resolve the issue and the function should now pass the failing tests.
