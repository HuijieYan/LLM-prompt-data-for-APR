There's an issue with the '_dict_arg' function which does not produce the expected output in the test cases.

The issue is that the function is adding double quotes around the value in the command list, but this is not expected. The tests are failing because of this. 

A possible strategy to fix the bug would be to remove the double quotes around the value in the command list in the '_dict_arg' function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the '_dict_arg' function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes here
    return command
```
