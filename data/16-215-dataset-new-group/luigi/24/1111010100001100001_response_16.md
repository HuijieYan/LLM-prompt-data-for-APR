The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not handling the dictionary input properly. It is adding the `name` parameter to the command list for each key-value pair in the dictionary and formatting the key-value pairs incorrectly.

The problem lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line appends the `name` parameter for each key-value pair, and the format for the key-value pair is incorrect, resulting in an incorrect command list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly handle the dictionary input and generate the command list.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version of the function will properly iterate through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and format them correctly before adding them to the command list. This should fix the bug and generate the correct command list for the SparkSubmitTask.
