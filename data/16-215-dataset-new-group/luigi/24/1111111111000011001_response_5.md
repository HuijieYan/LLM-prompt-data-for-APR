To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to prevent the overwriting of the `value` variable inside the loop. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'prop_value' to prevent overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten within the loop. This is because the loop variable has the same name as the input parameter `value`, which causes the issue. Renaming the loop variable to `prop_value` prevents the overwriting of the input parameter.

The corrected function changes the loop variable name to `prop_value`, ensuring that the command list is correctly constructed with the property-value pairs from the input dictionary.

The corrected function addresses the bug by renaming the loop variable to prevent the overwriting of the input parameter and accurately constructing the `command` list with the correct property-value pairs from the input dictionary.

This corrected function will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
