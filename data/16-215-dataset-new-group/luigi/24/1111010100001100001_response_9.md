The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly constructs the command list by surrounding the property-value pair with double quotes. This results in the command list containing unnecessary quotes when adding the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the command list construction.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

This corrected version constructs the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs, which is the cause of the bug. Now the function should work as expected and produce the correct command list.
