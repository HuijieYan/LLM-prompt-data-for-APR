The issue with the current implementation is that it is adding extra double quotes within the command list. Instead, we should only add the key-value pair as a single string without any extra quotes. We can fix this by removing the extra quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
