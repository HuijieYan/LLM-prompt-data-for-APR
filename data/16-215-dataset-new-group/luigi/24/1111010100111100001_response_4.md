The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary addition of quotes around the property and value when creating the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property and value in the command list when constructing it inside the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes, the function will construct the command list without the extra characters that were causing the test failures.

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass without any assertion errors.
