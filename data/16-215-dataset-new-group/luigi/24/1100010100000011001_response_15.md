## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary `value` and generate a command list based on its key-value pairs. However, the current implementation is not correctly formatting the command list and is not handling the input dictionary properly.

## Identified Errors
1. The function uses the same variable `value` to iterate through the dictionary and to store the individual values. This is causing the value of `value` to change and is likely leading to incorrect formatting of the command list.
2. The string formatting for the command list is not correctly adding the key-value pairs.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the variable `value`, leading to the incorrect addition of key-value pairs to the command list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable for iterating through the dictionary. Additionally, we should correct the string formatting for adding the key-value pairs to the command list.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
