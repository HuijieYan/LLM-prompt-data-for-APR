The bug in the given function is that it overwrites the `value` variable used in the `for` loop. This leads to incorrect values being added to the `command` list. 

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name in the `for` loop to avoid overwriting the input `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now work properly and pass the failing tests.
