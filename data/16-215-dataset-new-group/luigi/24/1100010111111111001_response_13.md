The issue with the current `_dict_arg` function is that it is wrapping the property value in double quotes, which is causing the failing tests. The expected values in the failing tests do not include the property value wrapped in double quotes. To fix the bug, we need to remove the wrapping of the property value in double quotes in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
