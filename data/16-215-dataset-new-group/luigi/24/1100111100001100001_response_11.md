The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is reusing the variable name `value` in the for loop, which overwrites the original `value` input parameter. This causes the function to incorrectly extract the `value` and `prop` from the input `value` dictionary, resulting in the wrong output.

To fix the bug, the loop variable in the for loop should be different from the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
