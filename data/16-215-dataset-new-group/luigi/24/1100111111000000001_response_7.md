The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that it does not handle the cases where the value is an empty dictionary. This results in the command list being returned as empty, causing the test to fail. 

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for an empty dictionary before processing the items in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the _dict_arg function will now handle the case where the value is an empty dictionary and properly generate the command list. This should resolve the failing test cases.
