The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary, iterate through its key-value pairs, and then append them to a list as a formatted string. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. The function doesn't handle the case where the value is an empty dictionary, which would result in an empty `command` list being returned.
2. The function incorrectly uses the same variable name `value` for the loop iteration variable and the input parameter. This causes a conflict and will lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix these issues, the function should be updated as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to a different name like val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name for the loop iteration (in this case `val`), we eliminate the conflict with the function's `value` parameter.

Additionally, we added a check for the input dictionary `value` to handle the case where it may be empty. If `value` is empty, the function will return an empty `command` list as expected.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function will be able to handle dictionary input properly and avoid conflicts between variable names.

I hope the above explanations and code correction will help to resolve the bug.
