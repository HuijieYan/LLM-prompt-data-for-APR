The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class fails to generate the correct command list for the Spark subprocess to execute. The function only appends the keys and values from the input dictionary to the command list if the dictionary is not empty and if it is of type dictionary. However, the keys and values are not properly formatted as command line arguments for the Spark subprocess.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to format the keys and values from the input dictionary into a proper command line argument format and then append it to the command list.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the keys and values from the input dictionary are formatted in the format `--key=value` and then appended to the command list.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
