The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not handling the input values correctly. The function is supposed to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and append them to the command list, but it is not doing so because the variable name is being overshadowed within the loop. Instead, the loop variable should be renamed to avoid this conflict.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed the value variable to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and append them to the command list.

This corrected version of the _dict_arg function should now handle the input values correctly and produce the expected output.
