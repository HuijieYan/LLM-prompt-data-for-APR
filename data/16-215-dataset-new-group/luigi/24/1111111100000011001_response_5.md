## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a `name` and `value` as parameters, iterate through the `value` (assuming it's a dictionary), and construct a command list with the format `['name', '"prop1=val1"', 'name', '"prop2=val2"', ...]`. However, there are a few potential errors in this function:
1. The parameter name `value` is being shadowed by the nested variable `value` in the for loop.
2. The `name` parameter is not included in the constructed command list.

## Bug Cause
1. The parameter name `value` is being used as both a function parameter and as an iterating variable in the for loop, causing confusion and potential issues.
2. The `name` parameter is missing in the constructed command list, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to avoid using the same variable name for the function parameter and the iterating variable in the for loop. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `name` parameter is included in the constructed command list.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The corrected _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the iterating variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val), name]  # Include the name in the command list
    return command
```
