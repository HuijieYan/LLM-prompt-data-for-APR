The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly adds the dictionary values with extra quotes around the property and value.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list, which results in the extra quotes in the command list and causes the assertion error in the tests.

To fix the bug, the function should add the property and value to the command list without enclosing them in quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change value to val to avoid overwriting the input parameter
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove quotes around property and value
    return command
```
