## Analysis
1. The `_dict_arg` function in the file `luigi/contrib/spark.py` takes three inputs `(self, name, value)` and returns a list of `command` items.
2. The error messages show that the content of the `command` list is incorrect in both cases.
3. The difference in the output concerns the formatting of the content within the `command` list.

## Identifying the Issue
The `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function contains incorrect formatting that causes the failing tests. Specifically, the `name` and `value` are not formatted correctly.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is due to incorrect formatting of the `name` and `value` elements. The function should iterate over the dictionary and append the key and value successfully. We can modify the function by adding a check for the type of value and then formatting the string accordingly.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append(f'"{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```
The corrected version uses the `append` function to add elements to the list `command`. The values within the list are also formatted in the correct way to match the expected output.
