The problem here is that the function is adding quotes around the property value when it shouldn't. This is causing the assertion error in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotes around the property value when adding it to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we removed the unnecessary quotes around "prop=prop_value" when adding it to the `command` list. This should fix the bug and make the failing tests pass.
