The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is related to the `command` list. The purpose of this function is to create a command that can be executed as a subprocess. The bug is causing inconsistencies in the `command` list that results in the incorrect output when compared with the expected output in the test cases.

The cause of the error is due to the addition of key-value pairs from the dictionary `value` to the `command` list using the format `"{0}={1}"`. The problem is that it includes the key-value pair within double quotes, which is not desired in the final command.

To fix this bug, the double quotes in the format `"{0}={1}"` should be removed so that key-value pairs are added without quotes to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected function `_dict_arg`:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to avoid conflict with the inner scope
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Adding key-value pairs in the format prop=val
    return command
```

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests provided.
