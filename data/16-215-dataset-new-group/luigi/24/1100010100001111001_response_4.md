The cause of the bug is that the current code is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. The format  `"{0}={1}"` is already providing the expected format, and adding double quotes around it is unnecessary.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the addition of double quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list construction.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will return the expected `command` list for the given input parameters in both Case 1 and Case 2.
