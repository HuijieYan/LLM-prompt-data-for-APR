The bug in the _dict_arg function is causing the value of a dictionary to be enclosed in double quotes in the return command list, leading to a failure in the comparison with the expected values.

The cause of the bug is that inside the for loop, the format function adds double quotes around the values in the command list, leading to a mismatch in the comparison with the expected values.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes from the format function and just append the property and value directly to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
