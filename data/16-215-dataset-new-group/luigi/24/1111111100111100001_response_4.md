The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the fact that the values in the dictionary are surrounded by double quotes, which is causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to remove the double quotes from around the values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from around the values, the function should now produce the correct command list and pass the failing test.
