The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary `value` and construct a command by iterating through the key-value pairs in the dictionary. It seems to have a bug where it reuses the variable `value` in the for loop which results in overwriting the original `value` passed to the function.

This can lead to incorrect construction of the `command` list and can result in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we should avoid reusing the `value` variable in the for loop and use a different variable to iterate through the dictionary items.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable inside the loop
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (`val` in this case) to iterate through the dictionary items, we ensure that the original `value` passed to the function is not overwritten and the `command` list is constructed correctly based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
