The issue with the buggy function is that it overwrites the value variable used in the loop with the value from the dictionary, causing the incorrect output. This is due to the reused variable name "value" for both the loop and the input parameter, causing confusion and overwriting.

To fix this, we should rename the loop variable from "value" to something else, and use a different variable for the loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter "value".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name for the loop, we avoid overwriting the input parameter "value" and ensure that the correct values are used to construct the command list. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
