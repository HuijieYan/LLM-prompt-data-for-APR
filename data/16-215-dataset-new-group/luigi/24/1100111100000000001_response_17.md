The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes three arguments `self`, `name`, and `value`. It is supposed to iterate over the items in the `value` dictionary and build a list of command strings based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, there is a potential error location in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. 

The issue with the buggy function is that it overwrites the `value` parameter passed to the function as a loop variable. This causes unexpected behavior, as the original `value` dictionary gets overwritten with each iteration of the loop.

To fix the bug, we can change the loop variable name from `value` to something else, such as `val` or `v`, to avoid overwriting the original `value` dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change loop variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
