The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect formatting of dictionary key-value pairs in the command list. The buggy function adds double quotes around the values when constructing the command list, which causes the tests to fail. To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the double quotes around the value
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
