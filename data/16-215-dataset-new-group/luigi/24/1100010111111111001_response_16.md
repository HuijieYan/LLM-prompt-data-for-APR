The buggy function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly adding double quotes around the values of the dictionary in the `command` list. This causes the test cases to fail because the double quotes are not expected in the output. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when appending the values to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removing unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes when building the `command` list, the function now should produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
