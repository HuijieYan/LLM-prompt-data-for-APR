The issue with the buggy function is that it is adding quotes around the property values in the command list when it shouldn't. This is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should remove the quotes around the value when adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed the variable to prop_value to avoid shadowing the prop variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Removed the quotes around the property value
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
