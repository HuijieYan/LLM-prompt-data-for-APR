The cause of the bug is that the `value` and `prop` are being wrapped in double quotes unnecessarily, which results in incorrect formatting of the command list.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
