The issue with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it is not properly constructing the `command` list based on the input `value`. It should be adding the `name` along with the `prop` and `value` from the input dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Modified to properly construct the command list
    return command
```

The strategy for fixing the bug is to iterate through the `value` dictionary properly and construct the `command` list by adding the `name` along with the proper `prop` and `value` pair.

With this corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, both the failing test functions should pass without any issues.
