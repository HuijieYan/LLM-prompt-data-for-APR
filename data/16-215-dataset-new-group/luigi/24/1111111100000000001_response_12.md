The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using the same variable name "value" for the input dictionary and the value within the loop, which is causing the original "value" to be overwritten. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" input parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # fixed variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name "prop_value" in the loop, we avoid overwriting the original "value" input parameter and ensure that the command is generated correctly based on the input dictionary.
