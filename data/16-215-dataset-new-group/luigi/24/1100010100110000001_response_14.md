## The problem:
The `_dict_arg` method is causing type confusion. The logic inside the method incorrectly adds double quotes around the `prop=value` string, which causes the test to fail. 

## The fix:
The `_dict_arg` method needs to be fixed to remove the unnecessary double quotes and address the type confusion by correctly constructing the command list.

## Here's the corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
This correction removes the unnecessary double quotes, fixes the type confusion, and lets the method correctly construct the command list.
