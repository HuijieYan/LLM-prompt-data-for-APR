The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary use of double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. This results in the extra double quotes appearing in the output, causing the test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property and value when formatting the string in the list concatenation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should create the command list without unnecessary double quotes and pass the failing tests.
