The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary and construct a list of command-line arguments that correspond to the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, the problem lies in how the function constructs the command list. It incorrectly includes double quotes around the key-value pairs, resulting in mismatched strings when comparing expected and actual command lists.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list before returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, and the failing tests should pass with the expected input/output values.
