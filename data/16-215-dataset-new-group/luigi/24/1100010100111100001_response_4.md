The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the inclusion of unnecessary quotation marks around the property value when creating the command list. This is causing the assertion error in the failing tests.

The bug can be fixed by removing the quotation marks from around the property value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
