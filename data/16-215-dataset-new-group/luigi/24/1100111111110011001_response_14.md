The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it adds double quotes around the values in the `command` list. This is not required and leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes when adding the values to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected outputs.
