The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list. The function is currently adding the name and value as separate elements of the list when they should be combined into a single string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly format the command list by combining the name and value using the format `"name=value"`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [f'{name}={prop}={val}']
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly create the command list with the expected format, and the failing tests should pass.
