Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The function is using the variable name 'value' for both the input parameter and the loop variable, which can cause confusion and potential errors.
2. The use of double quotes around the formatted string in the command list may cause issues when using the command later on.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is that it is using the same variable 'value' for both the input parameter and the loop variable within the 'for' loop. This can cause unexpected behavior and errors in the function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the loop variable name within the 'for' loop to avoid confusion with the input parameter name.
2. Remove the double quotes around the formatted string in the command list to ensure it is formatted correctly.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(str(name + "={0}={1}".format(key, val)))
    return command
```
