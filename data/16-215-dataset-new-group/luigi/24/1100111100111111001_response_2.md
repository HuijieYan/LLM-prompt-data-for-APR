The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it's adding an extra set of quotes around the value when building the command list. This causes the values to be formatted incorrectly when compared to the expected values. 

To fix this bug, we should remove the extra quotes when formatting the value and also when adding the key-value pairs to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
