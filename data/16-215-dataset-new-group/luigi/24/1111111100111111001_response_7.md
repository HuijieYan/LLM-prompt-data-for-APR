The issue with the function `_dict_arg` arises from the way it handles dictionary values. It incorrectly adds double quotes around the property and value when constructing the `command` list. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual list of arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property and value when constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
