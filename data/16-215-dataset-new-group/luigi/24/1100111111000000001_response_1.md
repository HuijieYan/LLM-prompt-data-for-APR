## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` seems to have an issue with the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` where it is trying to add the name and formatted key-value pair to the `command` list.


## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the failing test:
The function attempts to add the name and formatted key-value pair to the `command` list, but it does not take into account the format or structure of the expected command. This results in the test case failing because the command produced by `_dict_arg` does not match the expected command.


## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
The issue can be resolved by modifying the way the name and key-value pair are added to the `command` list, ensuring that it matches the expected command structure.


## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
