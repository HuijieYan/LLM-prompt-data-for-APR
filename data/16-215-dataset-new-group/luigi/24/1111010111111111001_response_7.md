To address the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, the issue arises from the incorrect formatting of the command list when constructing it out of a dictionary. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the double quotes should be removed from the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Key-value pairs without double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected command lists as per the provided input values.
