There are multiple issues with the current implementation of the _dict_arg function:
1. The function checks if the input 'value' is a dictionary and then iterates over its items. However, the iteration variable 'value' is re-used, leading to incorrect results.
2. The format of the command list is not as expected. The values should be surrounded by double quotes, which is missing in the current implementation.
3. Inconsistent naming between the input parameter 'value' and the iteration variable 'value' can lead to confusion and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Rename the iteration variable from 'value' to something else to avoid re-assigning it and causing confusion.
2. Enclose the values in double quotes to match the expected format.
3. Use the correct input parameter name when adding values to the command list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
