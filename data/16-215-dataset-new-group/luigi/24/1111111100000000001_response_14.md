The potential error in the buggy function is the reassignment of the `value` variable within the loop, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the `name` parameter seems to be used incorrectly.

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the reassignment of the `value` variable in the for loop. This could lead to unexpected behavior as the original `value` passed to the function is being overwritten. Additionally, the usage of the `name` parameter within the loop is incorrect, as it is being concatenated with the other values in an unpredictable way.

To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable and use a separate variable for constructing the command. This will ensure that the original `value` is not modified and that the `name` parameter is used properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += ['--{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, key, val)]
    return command
```
