The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it adds double quotes around the property value when constructing the command. This causes the failing test because the expected command list does not have the property values enclosed in double quotes, but the buggy function does.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will construct the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes, and it should pass the failing tests.
