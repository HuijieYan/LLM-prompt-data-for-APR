Potential error locations:
1. The variable `value` is being used as both the input parameter and the variable within the for loop, which can cause confusion and potentially lead to errors.
2. The use of double quotes around `"{0}={1}"` may not be necessary and can cause issues when the command is being constructed.
3. The function does not handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary.

Cause of the bug:
The use of the same variable name `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable can lead to confusion and potential errors. Additionally, the use of double quotes around `"{0}={1}"` may not be necessary and can cause issues when constructing the command. Finally, the function does not handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the loop variable to something other than `value` to avoid confusion with the input parameter.
2. Use single quotes around `{0}={1}` instead of double quotes to properly construct the command.
3. Add a check to handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary to avoid unexpected behavior.

Corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
