The bug in the _dict_arg function is the use of double quotes around the key-value pair in the command list. The correct format should be 'key=value' without the double quotes.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the double quotes around the key-value pair when appending to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
