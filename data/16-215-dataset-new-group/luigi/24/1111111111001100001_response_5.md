The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is not correctly creating the command list when the `value` input is a dictionary. Instead of adding each key-value pair as a separate item in the `command` list, it is concatenating the `name` and a formatted string of the key-value pair. This results in an incorrect command list.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function should iterate through the dictionary and add each key-value pair as a separate item in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
        return command
```

With this change, the _dict_arg function should now correctly create the command list when the `value` input is a dictionary.

The failing test cases should now pass.
