The buggy function is failing due to the use of unnecessary quotes around the property values in the command list. This is causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing test cases.

The potential error location is identified in the line:
```
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is adding unnecessary quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This is causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary quotes when formatting the property and value in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
