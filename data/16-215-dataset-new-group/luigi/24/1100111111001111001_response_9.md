The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not correctly formatting the dictionary items into the command list. Specifically, it's not enclosing the key-value pairs in double quotes. This is causing the failing tests as they expect the dictionary values to be enclosed in double quotes in the command list, but the function does not do that.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly format the dictionary items into the command list by enclosing the key-value pairs in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed the variable name to val to avoid conflicting with the outer variable name
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Enclosing the key-value pair in double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the dictionary items into the command list, and the failing tests should pass.
