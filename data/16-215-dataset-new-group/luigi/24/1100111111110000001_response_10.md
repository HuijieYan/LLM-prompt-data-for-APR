The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function should not encapsulate values that are already strings with double quotes.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
