## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command arguments. It iterates through the dictionary items and appends the key-value pairs as strings to the `command` list.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The use of the variable name `value` in the for loop and also as a function parameter could cause confusion and potential errors.
2. The string formatting in `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)` may not produce the desired result.
3. The condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` may not behave as expected.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function fails to correctly output the command list due to the incorrect usage of the loop variable `value`. The string formatting is also not in the expected format, and the condition to check if `value` is a dictionary is not necessary.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Rename the loop variable to something other than `value` to avoid confusion with the function parameter with the same name.
2. Adjust the string formatting to concatenate the key-value pairs in the desired format.
3. Remove the unnecessary condition to check if `value` is a dictionary because it is already specified as a dictionary in the function signature.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
