The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that the code inside the `if` block is not properly constructing the command list. The `name` parameter is being appended multiple times for each key-value pair in the dictionary.

The correct behavior should be to construct the command list with the key-value pairs from the dictionary, where each key-value pair is represented as `"{name}='{prop}={value}'"`. This means the `name` should only be appended once before the key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, the `_dict_arg` function needs to be updated to construct the command list in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command.append(name)
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append("'{0}={1}'".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now generate the command list correctly and pass the failing test cases.

I hope this information is helpful! Let me know if you need further assistance.
