## Analysis
1. The `test_run` and `test_defaults` functions fail with Python's `AssertionError` during the `self.assertEqual` test.
2. The error message specifies that the `list` of call arguments `proc.call_args[0][0]` differs from the expected list of arguments passed to the `proc` function in the test case. The differing elements are being quoted or not quoted in the expected and actual lists, which is leading to the assertion errors. 
3. Based on the failure in the `self.assertEqual`, there is a discrepancy with quoting or not quoting while formatting the args using a dictionary in the `_dict_arg` function. This discrepancy leads to the `AssertionError`.

## Bug in the Code
The `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when constructing the list of command arguments. It is not handling the quotes properly and leads to an inconsistency in the generated list that causes the test failures.

## Bug Fix
The function `_dict_arg` should quote the arguments when they are strings, while skipping the quotes for other non-string inputs.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):  # quote if the value is a string
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
