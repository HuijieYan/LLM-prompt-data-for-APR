## Analysis of the buggy function:
This function is intended to construct a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. However, there are potential error locations within the function:
1. The use of the variable name `value` for both the input parameter and within the for loop can cause confusion and potential errors.
2. The formatting of the command list using `"{0}={1}"` may not be correct.

## Potential causes of the bug:
The bug in the function is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the variable `value` and the formatting of the command list.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the variable names and references are distinct and to use the correct formatting for the command list.

## Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Changed variable names to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]  # Changed command list formatting
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the variable `value` within the for loop has been changed to `val` to avoid confusion with the input parameter. Additionally, the command list formatting has been changed to use `--{0}={1}` to align with standard command line argument formatting for a dict.
