The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's overwriting the `value` variable inside the loop, which causes incorrect command building. The `value` variable is being reused for both the input and the loop variable, causing the loop to incorrectly parse the dictionary and resulting in the wrong command list.

To fix the bug, the loop variable should have a different name than the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed the loop variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the loop variable `val` will correctly represent the value in the dictionary, and the `value` parameter will remain unchanged. This should resolve the bug and ensure the correct command list is built.
