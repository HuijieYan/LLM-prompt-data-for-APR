The issue is that the `_dict_arg` function is enclosing the value of the `'prop=value'` pair in double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the values and modify the formatting of the command concatenation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should correctly build the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes, which will resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
