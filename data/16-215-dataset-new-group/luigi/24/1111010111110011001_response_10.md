The issue with the original _dict_arg function is that it adds double quotes around the property=value pairs, which causes the test cases to fail because the test cases expect the values without double quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property=value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    
    # Corrected version of the _dict_arg function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values for both test cases.
