The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the way it handles dictionary values. It incorrectly adds quotes around the property and value when creating the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the value is a string and quote it if necessary, or simply add the property and value to the command list if they are not strings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle dictionary values and pass the failing test cases.
