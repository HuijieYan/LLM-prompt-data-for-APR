The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary use of double quotes when constructing the command list. This is leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values when comparing the lists in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
