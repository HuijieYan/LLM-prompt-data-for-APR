The issue with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it does not handle dictionary values properly and does not generate the correct command list. The `value` from the dictionary is not being used to create the command list, and unnecessary double quotes are being added.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the dictionary `value` and construct the command list properly without adding unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Concatenate name, prop and val without using unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version will handle the dictionary values properly and generate the correct command list, satisfying all the expected input/output values and types.
