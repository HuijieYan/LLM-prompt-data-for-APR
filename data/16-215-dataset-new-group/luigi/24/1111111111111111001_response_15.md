The problem with the current implementation of the `_dict_arg` function is that when creating the command list, it adds double quotes around the property and value. This causes the tests to fail because the expected and actual results do not match, due to the presence of the double quotes around the property and value.

To fix this issue, we should remove the double quotes around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
