The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not handling dictionary values correctly. It is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property and value when constructing the `command` list.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function needs to modify the way it constructs the command list by removing the double quotes around the property and value when adding them to the list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version constructs the `command` list by formatting the property and value without unnecessary double quotes.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
