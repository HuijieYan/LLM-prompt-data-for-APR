The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is causing the failing tests. The function is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command-line arguments, but the bug is causing it to incorrectly format the arguments. 

The bug seems to be caused by the way the function is constructing the command list. It is not correctly handling the `value` parameter when it is a dictionary, causing the command list to be constructed incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate over the dictionary and construct the command list by properly formatting each key-value pair. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly constructs the command list from the input dictionary. After making this change, the failing tests should pass.
