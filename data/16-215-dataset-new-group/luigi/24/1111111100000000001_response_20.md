### Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is meant to iterate over a dictionary and build a command list, but it has a bug where the loop variable `value` is assigned a new value within the loop. This reassignment of the loop variable causes unexpected behavior and potential errors.

The cause of the bug is that the loop variable `value` is being used for both the input parameter and to store the value of the dictionary items. This causes confusion and potential errors in the loop.

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop variable name within the loop, so it does not conflict with the function input parameter. Additionally, the loop variable name should be more descriptive to improve code readability.

The corrected version of the function `_dict_arg` includes changing the loop variable name from `value` to `val` to avoid conflict with the function input parameter, and to make the code clearer and less error-prone.
