The buggy function is `_dict_arg(self, name, value)`. It is designed to take a name and a dictionary value and convert the dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. The bug seems to be related to the way the function handles the dictionary values.

The failing tests are showing that the expected command list is different from the actual command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function. The differences in the lists are related to how the `value` from the dictionary is formatted within the command list.

In Case 1, the `value` is being enclosed in double quotes when added to the command list, resulting in an extra pair of double quotes around the `prop=value` pair. Similarly, in Case 2, the `value` is being enclosed in double quotes for some reason, causing a mismatch with the expected command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `value` from the dictionary is added to the `command` list. We should not enclose the `value` in double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes from around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes from around `{0}={1}`, the function will construct the command list without the extra quoting, addressing the issues observed in the failing tests. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
