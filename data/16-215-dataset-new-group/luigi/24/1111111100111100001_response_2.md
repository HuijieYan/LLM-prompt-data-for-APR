The issue in the buggy function is that when creating the command list, the function is adding unnecessary quotation marks around the property and value pairs when building the command list.

To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary quotation marks from the property and value pairs being added to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict with the input parameter
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotation marks
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly build the command list without unnecessary quotation marks and should pass the failing tests.
