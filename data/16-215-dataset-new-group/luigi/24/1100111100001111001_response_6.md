## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is caused by using the variable name in both the outer loop and the inner loop, resulting in overwriting the variable and causing incorrect output. To fix this, we need to rename the inner loop variable from value to val to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable.

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list with the expected formatting for each key-value pair in the input dictionary.
