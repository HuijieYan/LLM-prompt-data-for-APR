## Correction
The issue with the buggy function is that it reuses the variable name 'value' within the for loop, which overwrites the original value. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation. 

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary, without overwriting the original 'value' variable.
