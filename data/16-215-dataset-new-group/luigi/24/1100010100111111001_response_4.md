The bug in the function is that it is adding double quotes around the property-value pair when creating the command list, resulting in an incorrect format of the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should not add double quotes around the property-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]  # Removed the double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly create the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair. This should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
