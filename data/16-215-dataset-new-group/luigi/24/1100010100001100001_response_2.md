The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. The bug is caused by the use of the same variable name "value" inside the for loop, which overwrites the original input value. Additionally, unnecessary double quotes are added around the key-value pairs in the command list.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the original input value. We should also remove the unnecessary double quotes from the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name here
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```
