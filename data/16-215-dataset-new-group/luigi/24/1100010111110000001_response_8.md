The issue in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the use of quotes around the property and its value. This leads to discrepancies between the expected and actual argument lists.

The bug occurs because of the inclusion of quotes around both property and value, causing the `AssertionError` to fail whenever these lists are compared with each other.

To fix the bug, the quotes around `{0}={1}` should be removed, so that the function returns a list without any quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove the quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
