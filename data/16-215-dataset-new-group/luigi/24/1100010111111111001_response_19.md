Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug is caused by the function incorrectly adding double quotes around the property=value pair when building the command list. This causes the test cases to fail when comparing the actual and expected command lists.

To fix the bug, the function should build the command list without adding double quotes around the property=value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
