The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary to a list of strings, where each key-value pair becomes a separate string. However, there are two main issues with the function:
1. The `value` parameter is used as an iterator variable inside the loop, causing conflicts with the input parameter name.
2. The string formatting in the list concatenation is incorrect and may lead to unexpected behavior when using the resulting command list.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use a different variable name for the iterator and to properly format the strings in the list concatenation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly generate the command list and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test.
