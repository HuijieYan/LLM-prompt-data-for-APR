The issue with the `_dict_arg` function arises from the way it constructs the `command` list. The function is intended to create a list of command line arguments based on the input dictionary. However, it incorrectly adds double quotes around the key-value pair, resulting in mismatched strings in the output command list.

The faulty lines of code are:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

This line adds double quotes around the key-value pair, which is unnecessary and causes the failing test cases.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes and update the line to simply append the key-value pair to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now generate the correct command list without unnecessary double quotes, and it should pass the failing test cases.
