### Analysis:
The `_dict_arg` function takes a `name` and `value` as input, and it is expected to construct a command as a list based on the input values. However, there seems to be a bug where it's not correctly constructing the command.

### Identifying the potential error location:
The potential error location is in the construction of the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. It's currently not handling the dictionary values correctly to construct the command.

### Explanation of the bug:
Based on the failing test cases, the `_dict_arg` function is expected to construct a command based on the given input dictionary. However, due to the incorrect construction of the command list, the test cases are failing.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function needs to correctly iterate over the input dictionary and construct the command based on the key-value pairs.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed value to val
        return command
```
