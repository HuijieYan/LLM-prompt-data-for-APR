The root cause of the issue is that the `_dict_arg` function is not adding key-value pairs as arguments in a command list when the input `value` is a dictionary.

The function has a bug because it is wrapping dictionary values within quotes, whereas they should be added directly to the command strings. This causes the test to fail due to a mismatch in the command list when it is generated based on dictionary key-value pairs.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format and add the key-value pairs as arguments to the command list without unnecessary quotes. This might involve changes in how the loop iterates over the dictionary and how the key-value pairs are processed to create the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected function ensures that dictionary key-value pairs are added directly to the command list without quotes, allowing the test to pass successfully.
