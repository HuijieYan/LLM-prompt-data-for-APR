The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the property value when constructing the `command` list. This leads to the assertion error in the failing tests because the expected and actual command lists do not match due to the presence of double quotes.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the constructed command list. This can be achieved by using the format function without surrounding the value with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the constructed `command` list will not include unnecessary double quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
