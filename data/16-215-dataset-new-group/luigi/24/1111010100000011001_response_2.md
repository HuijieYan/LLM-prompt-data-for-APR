## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be that the variable `value` is being mistakenly used in two different contexts - first as the input parameter to the function, and then as a loop variable to iterate through the dictionary. This causes confusion and results in incorrect behavior. To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid this confusion.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
