The buggy function `_dict_arg` seems to be incorrectly generating the command list, resulting in an AssertionError in the test functions. The function is designed to take a name and a dictionary of values as inputs, and then generate a command list based on the name-value pairs in the dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that when constructing the command list, the function is adding extra quotes around the value pairs in the list. This leads to a mismatch with the expected command list, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command list without adding additional quotes around the value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed extra quotes around value pair
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should generate the command list without additional quotes, fixing the bug and allowing the test functions to pass.
