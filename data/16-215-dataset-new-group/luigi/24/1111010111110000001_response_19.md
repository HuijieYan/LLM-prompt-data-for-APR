The main issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it creates command in a non-sequential order due to if check, value could be a dictionary and a string or None. We can fix the problem by replace the if block to a simple check, remove in case of string and fix the incorrect quotes. The alternative is to use dictionary unpack operator to populate the command to run.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        command.extend([name, *["{0}={1}".format(prop, value) for prop, value in value.items()])
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        command.extend([name, value])
    return command
```
This updated function ensures that the command is populated in the required order and format. This should fix the original issue and pass the failing tests.
