The bug in the given function is that it is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. The bug causes the function to incorrectly format the key-value pairs when generating the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are properly formatted in the command list. This can be done by using the correct format for string interpolation, and also by adding the name parameter in front of the property as well as using the correct quotes for the value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list.
