The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command arguments. The function is using double quotes around the key-value pair, which is not desired, and it's not adding the key-value pair to the command list.

To fix the function, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pair and add the key and value to the command list separately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes and added key and value separately
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command arguments, satisfying the expected input/output values mentioned in the test cases.
