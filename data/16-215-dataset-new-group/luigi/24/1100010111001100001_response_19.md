The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect construction of the command list when the input `value` is a dictionary. The function incorrectly appends the `name` and `value` in the command list with an additional pair of double quotes, resulting in an incorrect format of the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the additional pair of double quotes in the command list when appending the `name` and `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the command list correctly when the input `value` is a dictionary and should now pass the failing tests.
