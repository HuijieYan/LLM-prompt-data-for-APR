The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not correctly construct the command list for the given dictionary input. It fails to separate the key-value pairs and incorrectly formats them as a single string.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to properly construct the command list by appending each key-value pair as a separate string in the format "name=prop=value".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly process the input dictionary and construct the command list as expected.
