The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs when creating the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is quoting the entire key-value pair using double quotes, which is not necessary and causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs and their values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This should resolve the issue and the function should now produce the correct output for the failing test cases.
