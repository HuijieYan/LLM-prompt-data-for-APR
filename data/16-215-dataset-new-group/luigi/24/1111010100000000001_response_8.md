## Potential Error Locations:
- The function _dict_arg may not be properly forming a command list based on the input dictionary value.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the _dict_arg function exists because the command list is not being formed correctly when iterating over the input dictionary. The logic to add key-value pairs to the command list is flawed.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to fix the logic inside the _dict_arg function to correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary. This can be achieved by iterating over the dictionary items and adding the key-value pairs to the command list in the desired format.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
