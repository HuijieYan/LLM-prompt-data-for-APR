The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not properly format the dictionary items and convert them into command strings. The function should create a list of command strings for each key-value pair in the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the dictionary items, convert each item into a properly formatted command string, and add it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will format the dictionary items as expected, producing the correct command list for the input dictionary.
