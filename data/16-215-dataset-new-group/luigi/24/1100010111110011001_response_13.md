The issue with the given function is that it is wrapping both the property and its value in double quotes, which is causing the failing tests. The function needs to be modified to handle this correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '--{0}'.format(prop), str(val)])
    return command
```

In this corrected function, we are iterating through the dictionary's items and adding each key-value pair to the command list separately. This ensures that the values are not wrapped in double quotes, which should resolve the failing tests.

The corrected function should pass both of the existing failing test cases.
