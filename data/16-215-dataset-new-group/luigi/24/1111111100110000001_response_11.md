1. The function `_dict_arg` in the class `SparkSubmitTask` is the buggy function. It's called in tests from the file `luigi/contrib/spark_test.py`. The primary error that occurs when the tests are run is a difference in lists. The erroneous function is intended to convert a dictionary to a list of arguments. 

2. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly adding a pair of values to the `command` list instead of adding the correct name-value pair.

3. When the function transforms a dictionary to a list of arguments, it improperly adds properties and values. This results in wrong assertions in the tests. The error raises because of a mismatch between the expected values and the actual values.

4. To fix the bug, we need to change the way dictionary items are formatted and added to the `command` list according to the expected format of the arguments. 

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed value to prop_value to avoid shadowing
            # Change the string format to add name-value pair without quotes
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates over the dictionary and now adds name-value pairs to the `command` list without quoting the pairs. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
