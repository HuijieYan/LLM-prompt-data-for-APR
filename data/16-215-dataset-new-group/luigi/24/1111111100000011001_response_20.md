The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that the variable name is being reused inside the for loop. This is causing the original name value to be overwritten and leading to incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we can simply use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the original name value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input parameters and satisfy the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
