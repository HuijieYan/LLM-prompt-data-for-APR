The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs. It is adding unnecessary quotation marks around the value when creating the command list, resulting in the AssertionError when comparing the expected and actual values.

To fix this bug, we should remove the quotation marks around the value in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the unnecessary quotation marks
    return command
```

With this change, the function will correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs without unnecessary quotation marks, and the failing tests should pass.
