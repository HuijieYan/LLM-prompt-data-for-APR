The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the command list for input dictionary values.

The function should be amended to properly format the command list for dictionary values, as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Change 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```

With this change, the function should correctly format the command list for both input dictionary values in Case 1 and Case 2. This will resolve the issues causing the failing tests in the test functions provided.
