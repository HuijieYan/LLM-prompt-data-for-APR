The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not treating the dictionary values properly to create the command list. The values from the dictionary are not being formatted as expected, leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle dictionary values correctly to create the command list. Specifically, the values should be formatted as `prop=value` without double quotes, and the entire command should be constructed using these formatted strings.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format dictionary values and pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
