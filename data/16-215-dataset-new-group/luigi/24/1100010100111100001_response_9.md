The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary to a list of command-line arguments. However, it currently adds double quotes around the property-value pairs, which is causing the failing tests due to incorrect formatting of the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly adds double quotes to the property-value pairs when constructing the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected command list.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```
