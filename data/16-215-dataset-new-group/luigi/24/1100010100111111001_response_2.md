The cause of the bug is that the function is adding extra double quotes around the property-values pairs when creating the command list, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes from around the property-values pairs being added to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changing variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removing extra double quotes from around the property-value pair
    return command
```
