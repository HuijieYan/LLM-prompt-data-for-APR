The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it reassigns the `value` variable inside the for loop, which leads to incorrect results. The original `value` parameter is being overwritten by the loop variable `value`.

To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable to something else, so that it doesn't overwrite the `value` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Rename the loop variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly build the `command` list based on the input dictionary `value`.
