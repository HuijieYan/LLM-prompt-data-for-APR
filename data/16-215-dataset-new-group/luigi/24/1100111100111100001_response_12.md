The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding extra quotes around the property values in the `command` list. This is resulting in a mismatch between the expected command and the actual command when the function is called.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the property values in the `command` list.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the extra quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
