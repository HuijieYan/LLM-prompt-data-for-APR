Buggy function analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a command list for a Spark job. However, it seems to have a bug where the inner loop variable 'value' is re-assigned after the outer loop variable 'value', causing potential conflicts and unexpected behavior.

Identified potential error locations:
The potential error lies in the re-use of the variable name 'value' for both the outer loop and the inner loop. This can lead to unintended overwriting of values and incorrect command generation.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises from re-using the variable name 'value' in both the outer and inner loop. This leads to unintended overwriting of values and incorrect command generation. For example, if the input dictionary has nested values, the inner loop's 'value' variable will overwrite the outer loop's 'value' variable, leading to unexpected behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should use different variable names for the outer and inner loop to avoid conflicts. Additionally, we should append the formatted strings to the 'command' list within the inner loop to ensure correct command generation.

Corrected version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the inner loop variable name to 'val'
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))  # Appended the formatted string to the 'command' list
    return command
```
