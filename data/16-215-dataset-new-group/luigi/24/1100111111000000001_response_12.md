The buggy function seems to be adjusting input values and creating command strings in an inconsistent manner, leading to an incorrect final output.

The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is the re-use of the variable `value` in the for loop within the function. Changing the name of the loop variable to avoid shadowing the function parameter should fix the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is iterating over the dictionary elements using `value` as the loop variable, which shadows the function parameter `value`.

To fix the bug, the loop variable name should be changed to something different from `value` to avoid overwriting the function parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed loop variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Updated to use the loop variable val
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the `command` list based on the input dictionary `value`. This should resolve the bug.
