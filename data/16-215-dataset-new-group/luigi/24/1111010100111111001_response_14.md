The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's adding unnecessary quotation marks around the value when constructing the `command` list for each key-value pair in the input dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotation marks around the `value` in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line of code.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
