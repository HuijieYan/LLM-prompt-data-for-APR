The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly formats the command list. The function is intended to iterate through the input dictionary and append the key-value pairs to the command list in the correct format, but it is not doing so.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list. The function is adding extra quotes around the key-value pairs, resulting in a format that is not valid for command line arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes from the command list and ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the command list with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. After making this change, the function should return the correct command list for the given input parameters.
