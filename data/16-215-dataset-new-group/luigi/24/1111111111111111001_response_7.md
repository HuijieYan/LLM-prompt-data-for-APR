The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding double quotes around the property and value when creating the `command` list, which is causing the tests to fail due to the difference in the structure of the command list.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes when creating the `command` list. The correct version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

This version of the function should produce the command list in the format expected by the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
