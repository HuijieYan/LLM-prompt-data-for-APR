The issue with the `name` variable being reassigned inside the for loop is causing the bug in the `_dict_arg` function. 

Since `value` is being redefined in the for loop, it will conflict with the input `value` to the `_dict_arg` function. This can cause unexpected behavior and incorrect results when building the `command` list.

To fix this bug, the variable names inside the for loop should be changed to avoid conflicts with the input variable. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change variable name to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
