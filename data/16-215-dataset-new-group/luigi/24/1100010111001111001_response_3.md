There are two issues with the _dict_arg function:
1. The value for each property should be enclosed in double quotes, which is missing in the current implementation.
2. The property name and value should be separated by '=', but the current implementation separates them with ':', which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _dict_arg function to include the property name and value separated by '=', and ensure that the value is enclosed in double quotes. 

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass both failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
