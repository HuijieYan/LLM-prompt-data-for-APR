The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it replaces the value parameter in the loop with the value of the inner loop, effectively overwriting the original value. This causes the function to only capture the last item in the dictionary.

To fix this bug, the value variable in the loop should be renamed to something else so that it does not overwrite the value parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name inside the loop from `value` to `val`, we prevent it from overwriting the original `value` parameter, thereby correctly capturing all key-value pairs in the dictionary as separate command arguments.
