Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function lies in the fact that the inner loop variable is also named 'value', which overwrites the input 'value' parameter. As a result, the function is not able to access the correct values for 'value' and 'prop', leading to incorrect output.

The fix involves changing the variable name in the inner loop from 'value' to 'val', ensuring it does not conflict with the input parameter.

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases.
