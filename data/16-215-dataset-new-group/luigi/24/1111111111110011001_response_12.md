The issue with the `_dict_arg` function seems to be the use of double quotes around the property and value in the command list. This is causing a mismatch in the test cases where the quotes are not expected.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property and value when concatenating them into the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming value to avoid conflict with input parameter
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed the double quotes from here
    return command
```

With this fix, the double quotes will not be included in the command list, and the function should pass the failing test cases with the expected values.
