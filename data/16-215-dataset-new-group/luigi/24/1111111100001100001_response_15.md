The issue with the buggy function is that it reuses the variable name `value` within the for loop, causing it to overwrite the original `value` parameter. This leads to incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we should rename the variable in the for loop to something else to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use val instead of value here
    return command
```
