The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding double quotes around the property value when creating the `command` list. This is resulting in incorrect comparison of the return value to the expected value in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property value when appending it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the property and its value are appended to the `command` list without any additional quotes.
