The bug in the provided function is that the variable `value` is getting overwritten inside the for loop. This causes the loop to iterate incorrectly and produce an incorrect `command` list.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the `value` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'prop_value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

This corrected version uses `prop_value` as the variable for the loop iteration, preventing the overwriting of the `value` variable. This should satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
