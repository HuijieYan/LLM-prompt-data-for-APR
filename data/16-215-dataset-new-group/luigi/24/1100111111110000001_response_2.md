The issue with the buggy code is that the _dict_arg function is not handling the dictionary values correctly.

The error in both test cases indicates that the dictionary is not converting its properties and values properly.

To address the problem, the code has to be modified to correct the way the values from the dictionary are being handled.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, value), the corrected function will format the dictionary properties and values in the proper way to be interpreted without quotes.

With the corrected function, the failing tests should pass, as the issue with parsing the dictionary properties and values has been addressed.
