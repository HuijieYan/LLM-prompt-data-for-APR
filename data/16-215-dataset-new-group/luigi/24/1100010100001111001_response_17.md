The bug in the given function is that the values are not properly formatted when adding them to the command list. The expected output is a list with elements in the format "{name}={value}".

To fix the bug, we need to update the formatting of the elements being added to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

In the corrected function, we use f-string formatting to properly format the elements being added to the command list. This ensures that the output matches the expected values for the given test cases.
