The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the `value` being wrapped in double quotes when added to the `command` list. This causes a mismatch with the expected format and leads to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes from around the `prop=value` string when adding it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name to `val` to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the double quotes from the format
    return command
```
