The bug in the given code is with the function `_dict_arg`. The bug occurs when creating the argument list for the spark command. The bug manifests itself as a failing test, as indicated in the error messages provided.

Looking at the failing tests, the cause of the bug seems to be that the function adds extra quotation marks and equal signs to arguments when they are added to the command list. This was not intended and causes the resulting command to be incorrect and fail the test cases.

A strategy to fix this bug is to avoid wrapping the key-value pair in quotation marks and an equal sign when adding the arguments to the command list.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now generate a command list without the unwanted quotation marks and equal signs, ensuring the correct and expected execution of the SparkSubmitTask.
