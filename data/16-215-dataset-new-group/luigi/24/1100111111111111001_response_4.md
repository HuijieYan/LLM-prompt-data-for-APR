The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly formatting the command list when generating the command line arguments. 

The bug stems from the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
In this line, it is adding `name` (e.g., '--conf') and the formatted string '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value) to the `command` list. The problem is that the formatted string is being enclosed in double quotes, resulting in mismatched quotes when forming the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the formatted string and ensure that the output is correctly formatted for the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should correctly generate the command list with the expected input/output variable values for both test cases.
