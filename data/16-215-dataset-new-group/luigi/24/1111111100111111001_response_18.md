The bug is in the _dict_arg function, specifically in the line where the command is being constructed. The bug is due to the use of double quotes around the property and value when adding them to the command list. Additionally, the use of double quotes is inconsistent. This is causing the actual command list to differ from the expected command list when the test is run.

To fix the bug, the double quotes around the property and value should be removed, and the construction of the command list should be standardized.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes and constructs the command list consistently. Additionally, it uses the variable 'val' to avoid shadowing the input parameter 'value'. This version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
