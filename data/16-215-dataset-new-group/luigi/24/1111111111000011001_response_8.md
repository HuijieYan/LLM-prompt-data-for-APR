Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the use of the variable name `value` within the for loop. This causes the original value of `value` to be overwritten, leading to an incorrect command list being built. 

To fix this bug, the variable names should be changed within the for loop to differentiate them from the outer variable `value`. Then, the correct values can be extracted and added to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed variable name from value to val
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
