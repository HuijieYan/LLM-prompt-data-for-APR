The `_dict_arg` function in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file is causing the failing test to give an AssertionError with the message "Lists differ".

In both test functions (`test_run` and `test_defaults`) defined in `test/contrib/spark_test.py`, the failing checks using `self.assertEqual` indicate a mismatch between two lists. These checks test the output of a certain class's call against the expected list of strings, which is being formed using the `_dict_arg` method that has a bug.

The bug in `_dict_arg` is the use of double quotes around `{0}={1}` inside the`format` method. The `format` method returns a properly formatted string, so adding unnecessary double quotes around it causes the error.

To fix the bug, remove the double quotes from the string inside the `format` function in the `_dict_arg` method as given below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By doing so, the unnecessary double quotes issue is resolved and the `_dict_arg` function will generate the command list correctly.

With the corrected function, the test should pass without any errors.
