The bug in the function is caused by reusing the variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable in the for loop. This leads to the overwrite of the original "value" input, resulting in incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable in the for loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command

```

By using "val" as the loop variable instead of "value", we prevent the overwrite of the original "value" input, and the function should now generate the correct command based on the input dictionary.
