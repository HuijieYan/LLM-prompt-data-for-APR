1. There is a class `SparkSubmitTask` that contains a function `_dict_arg`. This function seems to take a 'name' and a 'value' as arguments, and if the 'value' is a dictionary, it performs operations on the dictionary keys and values to construct a command. The failing test seems to identify mismatches in the arguments passed to `proc.call_args[0][0]`.

2. The potential error location is the code block where the `value` is being processed as a dictionary.

3. The failing test cases indicate that there is a mismatch in the arguments passed to `proc.call_args[0][0]`. The failing test has identified that the key-value pairs of the dictionary are not being processed correctly, leading to differences in the expected and actual command being constructed.

4. Strategy to fix the bug: The code block that constructs the command from the dictionary values can be modified to ensure that the keys and values are correctly processed and appended to the command list. Changes should ensure that the dictionary key-value pairs are processed as expected and do not lead to any unexpected formatting issues.

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function can be as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]) # Modified line
    return command
```
