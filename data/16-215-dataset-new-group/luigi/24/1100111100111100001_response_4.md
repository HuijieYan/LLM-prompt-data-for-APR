### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly handling the dictionary values when creating the `command` list. In the first case, it adds extra quotes around the value when constructing the command list, and in the second case, it adds quotes around the entire key-value pair.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list when the value is a dictionary. We should remove the extra quotes and handle the key-value pairs properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
