The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly handling dictionary values by adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values. This is the cause of the failing test, which expects a different format for the command list.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly construct the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes and constructs the command list in the format expected by the failing tests. This fix will ensure that the function passes the failing tests and satisfies the expected input/output values.
