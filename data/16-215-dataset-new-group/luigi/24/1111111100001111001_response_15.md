The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into the command list. It should be using the format `'"{0}={1}"'` instead of `'{0}={1}'` to ensure that the key-value pairs are enclosed in quotes.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` can be modified to correctly format the dictionary items into the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now successfully format the dictionary items into the command list as expected.
