The buggy function fails to generate the correct format for the command list. It should add double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not adding the double quotes around the key-value pairs when adding them to the command list.

To fix the bug, we can simply modify the line where the items are added to the command list by appending the key-value pairs with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
