The bug occurs in the `_dict_arg` method defined in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. This method is aimed to control the value of the given dictionary according to its key which is supposed to add each key-value pair as an argument to a command. The error stems from a mismatch in the assertion comparisons regarding the items from the dictionary that are expected to be added to the command, considering their expected format, when the function is executed. The discrepancy is probably caused by unnecessary double-quoting of the value in the `--conf` case. When analyzing the error messages, we notice that the assertion errors are due to differing elements, particularly with the `--conf` related arguments within the command.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_dict_arg` method to properly add the key-value pairs from the dictionary as command arguments. We should remove the unnecessary double-quotes in cases like `--conf` to match with the expected command.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            if name == '--conf':
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

The parts where double-quoting is not required are handled and for `--conf`, only the value part is placed accordingly without double quotes.
