To fix the bug in the _dict_arg function, we need to address the issue where the variable names are being reused. The loop variable "value" is being overwritten by the inner loop, causing unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function occurs when the variable name "value" is being reused in the inner loop, overwriting the original value. This leads to incorrect concatenation of the command list, resulting in unexpected behavior.

By changing the variable name in the inner loop to "val", we avoid overwriting the original value and correctly construct the command list.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values for all test cases.
