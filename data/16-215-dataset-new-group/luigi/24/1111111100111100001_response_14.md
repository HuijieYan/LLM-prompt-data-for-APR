The issue seems to be with the `_dict_arg` function, where it is not handling the dictionary values correctly when creating the command list. The function is incorrectly wrapping the dictionary values in double quotes, causing the AssertionError in the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly handle dictionary values without wrapping them in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed the double quotes around the value
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the value in the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)` statement, the function will generate the command list without wrapping dictionary values in double quotes, resolving the issue.
