The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not formatting the command correctly when the input `value` is a dictionary. The `value` should be formatted as `'prop=value'` within the `command` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the dictionary input properly and is not correctly formatting the command based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we should iterate through the dictionary items and format them as `'prop=value'` before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should correctly format the command based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary.
