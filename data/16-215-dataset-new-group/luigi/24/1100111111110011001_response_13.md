The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding the property and value to the `command` list enclosed in double quotes, which is not necessary. This causes the test cases to fail as it expects the values without quotes.

To fix this bug, the approach is to remove the unnecessary double quotes before adding the property and value to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, it will now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
