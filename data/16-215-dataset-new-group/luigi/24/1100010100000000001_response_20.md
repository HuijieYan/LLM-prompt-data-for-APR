## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change the variable name to prop_value to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to generate a command list based on the input dictionary. However, there are potential error locations in the function:

1. The variable name "value" is used for both the input parameter and the loop variable within the for loop, which can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.
2. Unnecessary double quotes are being added around the command values.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the variable name "value" is being reused within the for loop, and unnecessary double quotes are being added to the command values.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the loop variable needs to have a different name than the input parameter "value" to avoid conflicts. Additionally, the unnecessary double quotes around the command values should be removed.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and provides a more suitable implementation.
