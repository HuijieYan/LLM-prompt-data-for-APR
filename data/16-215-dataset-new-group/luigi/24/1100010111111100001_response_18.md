The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is enclosing the property-value pair within double quotes, which is causing the mismatch in the test results. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pair in the function _dict_arg.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the property-value pair, the function will correctly construct the command list without any mismatch, and the failing tests should pass.
