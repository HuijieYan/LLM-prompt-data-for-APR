The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly building the command list by including an extra set of double quotes around the property-value pair.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes when building the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
