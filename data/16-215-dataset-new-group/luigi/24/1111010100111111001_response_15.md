Firstly, there is an issue with the quotation marks around the key-value pairs in the `command` list. The expected output includes the key-value pairs as single strings enclosed in double quotes, while the buggy function includes double quotes for each part of the pair separately. 

To fix the bug, the function should concatenate the key and value into a single string and add it to the `command` list. This can be achieved by using f-strings or the `format` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the correct output and pass the failing tests.
