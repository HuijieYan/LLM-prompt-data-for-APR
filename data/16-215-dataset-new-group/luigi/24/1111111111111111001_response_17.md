The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the for loop. The loop iterates over the keys and values of the input dictionary and adds the name and formatted property-value pair to the `command` list. However, the property-value pair is erroneously enclosed in double quotes, which causes the test to fail.

The bug is occurring because the function is improperly formatting the property-value pair, resulting in the incorrect structure of the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pair and separate each property-value pair as a separate command.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the `command` list will be constructed without unnecessary double quotes, and the test cases are expected to pass.
