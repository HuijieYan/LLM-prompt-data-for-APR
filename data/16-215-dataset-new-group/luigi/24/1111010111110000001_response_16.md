The function `_dict_arg` is returning a list of arguments for a task. However, it appends the `value` value wrapped under double quotes if it's a non-empty dictionary. The failing test shows that the error is observed in the assertEqual statement when comparing two command string lists. The error message lists differ with a differing element.

To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, the wrapped double quotes should not be added around each property value for the command list. Updating the code to utilize the property name and value directly without wrapping it in quotes should result in the successful execution of the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Correct the way the values are being appended
    return command
```

This change will address the issue by correctly appending property names and values without double quotes, resolving the failing test cases.
