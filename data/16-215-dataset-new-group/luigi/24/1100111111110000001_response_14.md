The problem with the `_dict_arg` function lies with the line:
`command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`

This line inadvertently appends quotation marks around the value in the command list. The failing tests indicate that string formatting for the `--conf` argument is adding extra quotes, causing a failure. The correct format for this command should only have a single quote rather than a double quote.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to remove the quotes around the `{0}={1}` placeholders. 

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # Removed the extra quotes
    return command
```
