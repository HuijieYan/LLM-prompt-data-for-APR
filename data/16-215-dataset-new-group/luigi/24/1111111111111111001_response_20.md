In the given code, the _dict_arg function is intended to construct a list of command line arguments based on a dictionary of values. However, there are mistakes in the code that cause it to fail the tests.

The cause of the bug is that the code incorrectly adds quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected output. This is evident from the error messages indicating differences in the command list elements, specifically the presence of quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding quotes around the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by removing the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list, which should allow the function to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
