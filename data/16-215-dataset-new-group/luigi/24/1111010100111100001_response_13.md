The issue in the `__dict_arg` function is causing the error. The function is supposed to construct a command for submitting a Spark job, but it is not handling dictionary values correctly. When iterating through the dictionary, it is adding a double quote around the key-value pair, which is incorrect.

The bug is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes from around the key-value pairs before adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `__dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes, the function should now correctly construct the command for submitting a Spark job and pass the failing tests.
