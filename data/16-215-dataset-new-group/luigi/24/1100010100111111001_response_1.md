The issue with the function is that it is incorrectly quoting the key-value pairs in the command list. The input values are being wrapped in double quotes, which is not expected.

To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes from the format string and only concatenate the key-value pair without any additional quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes from the format string
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
