    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                if '=' not in value:
                    command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # pass arguments without quotes if they do not have an equals sign
                else:
                    command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

The problem with the buggy function is that in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, for the properties that don't have an equals sign, the value should be added without quotes. The current implementation adds quotes around all values, causing the tests to fail.

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function addresses this issue and modifies the logic to add quotes only when necessary, thereby fixing the bug:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                if '=' not in value:  # check if value has an equals sign
                    command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # pass arguments without quotes if they do not have an equals sign
                else:
                    command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]  # pass arguments within quotes if they have an equals sign
        return command
```
