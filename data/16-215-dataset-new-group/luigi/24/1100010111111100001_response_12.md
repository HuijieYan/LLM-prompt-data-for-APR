The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary items, enclosing the property=value pairs in double quotes. This causes the failing tests to compare the expected and actual lists, resulting in assertion errors due to the difference in string formatting.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property=value pairs when constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the `command` list will be constructed without the unnecessary double quotes, which should match the expected list in the failing test cases.

The corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
