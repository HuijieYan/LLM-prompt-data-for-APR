The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly constructing the command list for the given input dictionary.

The bug is caused by the use of the same variable name `value` in the for loop which overwrites the original `value` input variable. This causes the function to only consider the last key-value pair in the dictionary during iteration.

To fix the bug, we need to change the name of the loop variable to something that does not conflict with the input variable `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use val instead of value
    return command
```

By changing the loop variable name to `val`, we prevent the conflict with the input variable `value`, and the function should now correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests provided.
