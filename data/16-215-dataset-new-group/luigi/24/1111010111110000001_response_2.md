Here's an analysis, explanation of the bug and a corrected version of the buggy function

Analysis:
The bug is in the method `_dict_arg`. The method is used to form a command but it has a logical error. The error in the method logic is causing the output of the command to be incorrect, which results in an assertion error in the tests.

Explanation of the Bug:
The incorrect output in the command causes different lists resulting from the `_dict_arg` method to fail the assertion test causing the tests to fail.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, I will modify the `_dict_arg` method to properly construct the command. In order to do so, we need to modify this line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`  and avoid using double quotes to wrap the property and the value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:
```python
# We need to modify the _dict_arg method
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []

    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]

    return command
```
