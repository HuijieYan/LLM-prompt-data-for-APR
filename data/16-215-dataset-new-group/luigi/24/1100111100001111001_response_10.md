The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly appending the dictionary key-value pairs to the command list. It is using the format "prop=value" instead of '"prop=value"'. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the way the key-value pairs are formatted and appended to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
