Looking at the `_dict_arg` function, it appears that the method is intended to transform a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, there are potential issues in the function and how it processes the input dictionary.

In this case, it seems that the bug stems from the concatenation of the command list `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. It should simply append the new items to the list, but the use of the `+=` operator may be causing issues by trying to concatenate the lists rather than adding elements to the existing list.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to append the items directly to the `command` list, rather than using the `+=` operator which concatenates lists.

Here is the fixed version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this change, the function should correctly convert the dictionary into a list of command-line arguments, and the provided test should pass.
