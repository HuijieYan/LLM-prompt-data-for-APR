## Analysis
The function is intended to take a name and a dictionary of values, and construct a command list based on the format `"name='prop=value'"`. However, there are several issues with the current implementation:
1. The function overwrites the name parameter with the prop parameter within the for loop.
2. The function incorrectly uses double quotes around the property=value pair.

## Bug
The bug is caused by the variable name being overwritten with the variable value in the for loop, and the incorrect use of double quotes around the property=value pair.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration and replace the double quotes with single quotes in the command list construction.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name for the loop iteration
            command += [name, "'{0}={1}'".format(prop, val)]  # use single quotes instead of double quotes
    return command
```
