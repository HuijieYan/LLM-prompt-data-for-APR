The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable `value` is used as the loop variable and also checked for truthiness. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially result in a logical error.

The cause of the bug is that the loop variable `value` is being overwritten with the looped values from the dictionary, and it is also being used to check for truthiness. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially result in a logical error.

To fix the bug, we can use a different variable name for the looped values in the dictionary and modify the check for truthiness to explicitly check for `None` or an empty dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
In this corrected version, we use `key` and `val` as the loop variables for the dictionary items, and we check for truthiness using `if value and isinstance(value, dict)`. This ensures that the loop variable is not overwritten and the truthiness check is explicitly checking for a non-empty dictionary.
