The bug in the `_dict_arg` method is that it incorrectly quotes the property and value in the command list when building the command. This leads to a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases and causes the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to remove the quotes around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly build the command list without quoting the property and value, and the tests should pass.
