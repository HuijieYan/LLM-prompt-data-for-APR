The buggy function fails to correctly construct the command list as it does not properly handle the values of the dictionary. The function is intended to create a command list to be passed to a subprocess, where each key-value pair in the dictionary is added as a separate argument to the command.

The bug occurs because the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list. This is causing the failing tests to have a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists.

To fix this bug, the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs should be removed. Additionally, the function should handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, and it will handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary.

This corrected version should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
