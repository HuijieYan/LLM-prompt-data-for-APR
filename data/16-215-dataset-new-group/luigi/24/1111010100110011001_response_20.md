To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value when they are added to the command list. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when adding them to the command list. Now, the function should pass the failing tests and return the expected output.
