The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to generate a command list based on a dictionary of arguments, but it has several issues. It relies on mutating the `command` list, and it doesn't handle the case where `value` is not a dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly constructing the command list based on the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the case when `value` is not a dictionary and to correctly populate the command list based on the input dictionary.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we've made the following changes:

1. We are checking for `value` being not None before proceeding to check if it is a dictionary.
2. The loop variable `value` has been renamed to `val` to avoid name conflicts.
3. We are using `extend` instead of `+=` to add individual items from the dictionary to the `command` list.


By using this corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the failing test cases should pass as the correct command list will be generated based on the input dictionary.
