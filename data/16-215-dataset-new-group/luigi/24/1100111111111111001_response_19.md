The issue with the buggy function is that it is mistakenly adding quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list. This is causing the failing tests as they are not expecting the quotes in the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should append property-value pairs directly to the command list without adding quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
