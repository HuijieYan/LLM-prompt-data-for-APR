The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the use of double quotes around the values in the `command` list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual values when comparing the command list in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # avoid using 'value' as a variable name to prevent potential conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove double quotes around the value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
