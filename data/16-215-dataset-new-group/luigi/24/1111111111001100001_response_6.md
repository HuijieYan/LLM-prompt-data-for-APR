The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not correctly constructing the command list when the input `value` is a dictionary. It is not handling the construction of the command list correctly for dictionary inputs.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list for dictionary inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` instead of `value` inside the loop, we make sure that we are iterating over the dictionary values correctly and constructing the command list as expected.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
