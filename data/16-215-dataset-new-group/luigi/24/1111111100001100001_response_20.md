The issue in the buggy function is that the inner loop is using the same variable name `value` for both the input and the iteration. This causes the outer `value` to be overwritten by the inner `value`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop, avoiding the conflict with the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # using 'val' instead of 'value' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` as the variable name in the inner loop, we avoid overwriting the outer `value` variable from the input, fixing the bug.
