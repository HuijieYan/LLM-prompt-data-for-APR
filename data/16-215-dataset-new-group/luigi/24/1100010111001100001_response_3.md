The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it uses the same variable name 'value' for both the input parameter and the loop variable, causing a conflict and leading to incorrect behavior. This results in the incorrect generation of the `command` list, which in turn causes the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the loop variable in the for loop should be renamed to avoid the conflict with the input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # renamed loop variable to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `prop_value`, we avoid the conflict with the input parameter, and the function should now correctly generate the `command` list. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
