The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary. It is not handling the case where the value is a string instead of a key-value pair. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the value is a string and construct the command accordingly. If it is a key-value pair, then we should construct the command as before.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        command += [name, value]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, it should handle both dictionary and string inputs correctly, and it should pass the failing tests.
