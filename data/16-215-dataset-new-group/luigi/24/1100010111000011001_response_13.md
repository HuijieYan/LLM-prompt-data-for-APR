## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid conflict with the function parameter
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Use -- instead of " " to format the command
    return command
```

Explanation:
1. The original function incorrectly formatted the command by adding quotes around the property-value pairs, which is not the standard format for command-line arguments.
2. It also used the same variable name "value" in the loop, causing a conflict with the function parameter.
3. The corrected version uses "--" to format the command and renames the value variable within the loop to avoid conflicts.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected values for the given input parameters.
