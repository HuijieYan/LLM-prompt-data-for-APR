The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where 'value' is not a dictionary. The function assumes that the 'value' input is a dictionary and attempts to iterate over it, causing a TypeError when 'value' is not a dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if 'value' is a dictionary. If it is, then we can iterate over it and construct the command list. If 'value' is not a dictionary, we can simply return an empty command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This fixed function will handle the case where 'value' is not a dictionary and the failing tests should now pass.
