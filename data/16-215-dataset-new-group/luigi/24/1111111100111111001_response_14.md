The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a name and a dictionary as input and return a list of command arguments. The bug is that it is not properly handling the dictionary values.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding double quotes around the dictionary key-value pairs, which is not expected. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly construct the command list without adding additional quotes to the dictionary key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modification removes the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary key-value pairs, which should resolve the failing test cases.
