## Analysis:
The buggy function seems to be taking in a `name` and `value` and creating a command list based on the `value` being a dictionary. The function then iterates through the dictionary and appends items to the `command` list.

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error in the function seems to be the reusing of the variable name `value` for the loop variable, which may lead to conflicts.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be caused by the reuse of the variable name `value` within the loop, which causes conflicts with the original `value` input to the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the loop variable `value` needs to have a different name to avoid conflicts with the original function input. Additionally, it's good practice to make sure the function handles cases where the input `value` is not a dictionary.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the revised version, the loop variable `value` has been changed to `val` to avoid conflicts. Additionally, the function now checks if the input `value` is indeed a dictionary before proceeding with the loop.
