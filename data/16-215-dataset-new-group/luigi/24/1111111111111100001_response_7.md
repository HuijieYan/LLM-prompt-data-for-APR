The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by creating extra double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the `command` list, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual command list in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we should remove the extra double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed value to val to avoid naming conflict with the input variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed extra quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
