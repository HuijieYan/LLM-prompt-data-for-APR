The _dict_arg function is designed to construct a command line list from a dictionary. It's supposed to iterate through the dictionary and add each key-value pair in 'name=prop' format to the command list.

From the error message of the failing test:
- AssertionError: Lists differ
- First differing element
- The failing test is due to a discrepancy between an expected list and the actual output of the _dict_arg function.

Based on the error message, the issue seems to be with the way the properties from the dictionary are being added to the command list. The function is currently adding the property-value pairs with double quotes which are not required.

The cause of the bug is the inclusion of additional double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to remove the additional double quotes while constructing the command list from the dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the _dict_arg function should work as intended and pass the failing tests.
