The bug in the buggy function is that it is not correctly formatting the command list based on the input dictionary. It is not wrapping the property-value combination in double quotes as expected.

The input dictionary should be formatted as `'{prop}="{value}"'`, but the buggy function is currently formatting it as `'{prop}={value}'`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to wrap the property-value combination in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [f"{name}", f'"{prop}={value}"']
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the command list and pass the failing tests.
