Based on the provided input and buggy function, the issue is that the function is not correctly constructing the command list. The function is intended to take a name and a dictionary of properties, then construct a command list by formatting the properties and values. However, the implementation is not handling the formatting correctly, resulting in incorrect command list generation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the properties and values are formatted and added to the command list. Instead of formatting the property and value with double quotes and an equal sign, we should directly concatenate the strings with an equals sign.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
