The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it is enclosing the property=value pairs in double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when appending the property=value pairs to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
