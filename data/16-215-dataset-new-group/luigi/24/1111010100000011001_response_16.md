## The corrected version of the function
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list. Additionally, using the same variable `value` within the for loop caused conflicts and improper handling of the input.

In the corrected version, the unnecessary double quotes have been removed, and the variable that iterates through the dictionary items has been changed to `val` to avoid conflict.

The corrected function satisfies the expected input/output values and types for both cases.
