1. The buggy function is in the `spark.py` file and is defined within the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The failing test references subprocess.Popen and calls the `TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask()` and `TestSparkSubmitTask()` classes. The error message shows that there's a problem with the `dict_arg()` function that is generating a command list in the `SparkSubmitTask` class.

2. A loop inside the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly formats the value from the dictionary as `"prop=value"` with double quotes included.

3. The cause of the bug as per the error message is due to the incorrect formatting of the arguments in the command list generated by the `_dict_arg` function. The function wraps the values from the dictionary's key-value pairs with double quotes regardless of the data type of the value. As a result, when the command list generated by `_dict_arg` function is compared with the expected output in the test, they do not match because of these double quotes around the values of the dictionary keys.

4. To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should check the type of the value from the dictionary before formatting it into `"prop=value"` and only include the double quotes if the value is a string. If the value is an integer or any other data type, it should be included as `prop=value` in the command list.

5. Here's the corrected version of `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # previous code here ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                if isinstance(val, str):  # check if value is a string
                    command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)] 
                else:
                    command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the code will correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs according to their data type and generate a command list without the erroneous double quotes around non-string values.
