The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary items into a command list. The bug causes the values in the dictionary to be enclosed in double quotes when they should not be. This is causing the assertion errors in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly format the dictionary items into a command list without enclosing the values in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should properly generate the command list with the dictionary items formatted correctly, fixing the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
