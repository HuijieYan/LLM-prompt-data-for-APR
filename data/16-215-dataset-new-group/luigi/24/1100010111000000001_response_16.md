Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, it appears that the bug is occurring in the _dict_arg function. The function is not correctly formatting the dictionary arguments. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling dictionary values when constructing the command list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly format the dictionary values and append them to the command list as separate arguments. This can be accomplished by iterating through the dictionary and appending each key-value pair as a separate argument in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle dictionary arguments and pass the failing test.
