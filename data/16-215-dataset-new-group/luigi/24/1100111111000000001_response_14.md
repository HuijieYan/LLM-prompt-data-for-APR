The buggy function seems to be incorrectly generating the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` method. It appears to be overwriting the `value` variable, causing unexpected behavior.

The potential error location is here:
```python
for prop, value in value.items():
```

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is overwriting the `value` variable with the iteration variable in the for loop. This causes unexpected behavior in the subsequent usage of the `value` variable.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to change the name of the iteration variable in the for loop to something other than `value` to avoid overwriting the existing `value`.

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```
