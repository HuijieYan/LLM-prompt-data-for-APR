The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that the values of the dictionary are not being enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the incorrect output. The function is supposed to generate a command list based on the input dictionary, with each key-value pair being formatted as "key=value".

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to enclose the values in double quotes as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This revised function will enclose the values in double quotes as expected and will satisfy the provided test cases.
