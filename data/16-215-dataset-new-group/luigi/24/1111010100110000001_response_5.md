The functions `test_run` and `test_defaults` are failing in the `contrib.spark_test.SparkSubmitTaskTest` class, returning an assertion error. It's clear that the failure is due to discrepancies between the expected `proc.call_args` and the actual values.

The `proc.call_args` are assertions that involve comparing lists of command line arguments. Specifically, the errors indicate that there is a mismatch between the expected list of command line arguments and the actual list of command line arguments.

Based on the error message, the issue arises when comparing the actual list generated by the `_dict_arg` function with the expected command list.

The cause of the bug is within the `_dict_arg` method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The `_dict_arg` method is intended to construct command-line arguments based on input dictionary values, but it currently has issues when there are dictionary values that contain additional quotes.

To fix the bug, we should modify the implementation to ensure that the command list is constructed properly from the dictionary.

The corrected version:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command.append(name)
                command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value))
        return command
```

By changing `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command.append(name)` and `command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value))`, we can resolve the issue with additional quotes being added.

After replacing the buggy function with the corrected version, the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
