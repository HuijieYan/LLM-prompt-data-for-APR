The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary values as strings. Instead of properly formatting the key-value pairs, the bug adds unnecessary quotation marks around the values in the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the values when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Properly format the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotation marks
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs as expected and pass the failing tests.
