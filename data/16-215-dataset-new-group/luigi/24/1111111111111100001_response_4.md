The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not correctly handling dictionary values when forming the command list.

The bug occurs because the buggy function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property=value pairs when creating the command list. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the failing tests, resulting in assertion errors.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the property=value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the property=value pairs, the corrected function should now generate the command list correctly and pass the failing tests.
