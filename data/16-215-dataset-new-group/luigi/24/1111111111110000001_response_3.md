Analyze:

The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes two arguments, `name` and `value`. It is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class within the `luigi.contrib.spark` file. This class is a template task for running a Spark job, and supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn.

Looking at the failing test function, it showcases an `AssertionError`. The error indicates that there are issues with the structuring of command elements in the `proc.call_args[0][0]` list. The error points to disagreements in specific properties such as `'--driver-library-path'`, `'--conf'`, `--properties-file`, etc.

Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:

The primary reason for the failure is in the `_dict_arg` function where the command list is being constructed.

Explanation of the cause of the bug:

The cause of the bug is related to the way the command list is being constructed. It uses append operations and formatting in a way that is resulting in the list holding additional quotation marks around the values, which differentiates it from the expected result where these values should not have quotation marks around them.

Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by modifying the way the elements are being added to the command list. Specifically, the formatting operation should be altered in order to not include extra quotation marks around the property and value strings when adding them to the list. A revised logic should ensure that these elements are added to the list without extra quotation marks.

The corrected version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With the corrected version, the test functions that were failing should now pass as the constructed command list would match the expected results.
