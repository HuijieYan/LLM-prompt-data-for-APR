The issue with the buggy function is that it wraps the property values in double quotes, which causes the test to fail when it compares the expected and actual command lists. 

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes from around the property values when building the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from the `'{0}={1}'` format string, we ensure that the property values are not enclosed in double quotes, which should fix the comparison issues in the failing test cases.
