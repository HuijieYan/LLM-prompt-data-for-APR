To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when adding it to the command list in the _dict_arg function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed the double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes, and both failing tests should pass.
