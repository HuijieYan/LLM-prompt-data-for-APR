The bug identified is that in the `_dict_arg` function, the property name and the value are not being concatenated properly. The concatenated string is not forming correctly, mainly because the double quotes are added unnecessarily around the value.

The fix for this bug is to remove the double quotes added around the value in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The usage of the `dict_arg` function should now properly generate the command list without causing issues with extra double quotes. The corrected version should pass both the failing tests.
