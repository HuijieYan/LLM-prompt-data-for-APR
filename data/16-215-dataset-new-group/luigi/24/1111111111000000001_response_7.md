The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is not properly constructing the command list. When the function loops through the dictionary and creates the command list, it doesn't correctly format the key-value pairs in the command list. Instead, it concatenates the command list with the name and improperly formatted key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, we should update the function to properly format the key-value pairs and append them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Correctly formatting the key-value pairs
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing test cases.
