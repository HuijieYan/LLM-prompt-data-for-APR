The problem with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it adds quotes around the property values, which causes the final command to fail.

To fix this issue, I will remove the additional quotes from around the property values to ensure that the resulting command list is formatted correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
By making these changes, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now produce a properly formatted command list, avoiding the issue that caused the failing test.
