The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the unnecessary use of double quotes around the property and value in the `command` list. This is leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from around the property and value while constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
