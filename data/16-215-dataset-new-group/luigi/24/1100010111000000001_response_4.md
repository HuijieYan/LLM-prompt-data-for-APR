Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The handling of the command list may not be correctly building the command list in the _dict_arg function.
2. The value being appended to the command list may not be formatted correctly with the name.

Cause of the bug:
The _dict_arg function is not correctly building the command list with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. It may not be formatting the values properly with the name.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _dict_arg function to correctly iterate through the input dictionary and build the command list with the formatted key-value pairs.
2. Ensure that the values are correctly formatted with the name before appending to the command list.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
