The bug in the given function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary value into a string inside the list 'command'. 

The bug is caused by the way the function is trying to join 'name' with the formatted string of 'prop' and 'value', resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code inside the for loop to properly concatenate the 'name' with the formatted string of 'prop' and 'value', and then append it to the 'command' list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} \"{prop}={val}\"")
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the dictionary value into a string and append it to the 'command' list. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
