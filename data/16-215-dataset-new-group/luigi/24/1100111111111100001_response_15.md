The issue with the buggy function is that it is adding double quotes around the property value pairs when constructing the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail due to a mismatch in the format of the command list.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to remove the double quotes from the command list when constructing it. This can be achieved by changing the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
to
```python
command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
```

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided.
