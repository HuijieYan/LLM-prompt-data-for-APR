The given `SparkSubmitTask` class has the `def _dict_arg(self, name, value)` function which is buggy and causing the tests to fail with an AssertionError.

The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not working as expected when the value passed to it is a dictionary. The failing assertions are due to the items in the dictionary being inconsistently formatted when adding to the command list.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_dict_arg` function to handle dictionary values in a consistent and clean way. The name and value of each property should be formatted uniformly and added to the command list without any additional quotes.

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function will format the items in the dictionary consistently and correctly when adding them to the command list, which will resolve the failing tests.
