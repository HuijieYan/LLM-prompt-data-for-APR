## After analysis and fixing the bug, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid overwriting value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use a different variable name to avoid confusion
    return command
```

Explanation of the bug and the fix:
The bug in the original function was caused by reusing the variable name "value" in the for loop, which overwrote the input value and caused incorrect behavior. This was due to using the same variable name "value" in the for loop as the input parameter. The fix involved using a different variable name "val" in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input value and causing confusion.

By making this simple change, the function will correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary, and the bug will be fixed.
