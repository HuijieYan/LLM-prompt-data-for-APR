The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as command-line arguments. Instead of encapsulating the key-value pairs with double quotes, it is only encapsulating the values. This causes the failing tests to fail because the command does not match the expected command.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as command-line arguments by encapsulating both the keys and values with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now format the key-value pairs correctly as command-line arguments and pass the failing tests.
