Potential error locations:
1. The variable "value" is used as both an input parameter and a loop variable, which can lead to confusion and potential errors.
2. There is a potential issue with formatting the command string with double quotes around the value.

Cause of the bug:
The potential error with using the same variable name "value" for the input parameter and loop variable can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the formatting of the command string with double quotes might not be done correctly, leading to incorrect command generation.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the loop variable to avoid confusion with the input parameter.
2. Use proper string formatting to ensure the command string is generated correctly.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value_dict):
    command = []
    if value_dict and isinstance(value_dict, dict):
        for prop, val in value_dict.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```
