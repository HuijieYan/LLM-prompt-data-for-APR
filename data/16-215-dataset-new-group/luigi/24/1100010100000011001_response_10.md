The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the variable `value` is being overwritten in the for loop, which leads to incorrect results in the `command` list. 

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output values and types for the given test cases.
