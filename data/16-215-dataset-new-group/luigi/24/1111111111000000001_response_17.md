The problem with the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is that it uses the same variable name `value` for both the input value and the value of the dictionary's items, which causes it to be overwritten. This results in a missing command list for the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we can modify the variable names within the for loop to avoid overwriting and properly construct the command list. Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the failing test cases should now pass.
