To fix the buggy function, we need to identify the potential error locations and causes of the bug. It seems that the _dict_arg function in the SparkSubmitTask class is responsible for constructing a command for a Spark job. The function is supposed to iterate over a dictionary of properties and add them to the command.

The potential error in the _dict_arg function is the reassignment of the "value" variable inside the loop. Since "value" is already used as an input parameter for the function, reassigning it inside the loop can lead to incorrect behavior.

This bug can cause the command list to contain incorrect elements, leading to unexpected behavior when running Spark jobs.

To fix the bug, we should avoid reassigning the "value" variable inside the loop. Instead, we can use a different variable name to avoid conflicts.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable name "val" to avoid reassignment
    return command
```

By using a different variable name inside the loop and refraining from reassignment, we can ensure that the correct values are added to the command list.

This corrected version of the _dict_arg function should now pass the failing test cases.
