The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the fact that it is incorrectly formatting the input dictionary `value` and creating a list `command` with the wrong format.

The issue with the function is that it is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when creating the `command` list, resulting in the incorrect format for the command.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. We can also simplify the code by using a list comprehension.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command += [name] + [f'{prop}={val}' for prop, val in value.items()]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass without any issues.
