The bug in the given function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. The function is incorrectly using double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs, resulting in an incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs and ensure that the command list is created in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function removes the unnecessary double quotes and correctly formats the key-value pairs in the command list. It satisfies the expected input/output values provided in the cases.
