The bug in the provided function is that when creating the list `command`, it is not adding the values for the dictionary correctly. The expected behavior is to add each key-value pair as a single string to the list `command`, enclosed in double quotes and separated by an equal sign.

The bug is causing the failing test to not match the expected values because the function is not formatting the key-value pairs properly.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be updated to correctly format and add the key-value pairs to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format and add the key-value pairs to the `command` list, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
