## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to take a name and a value as input and return a list of command line arguments. It is currently iterating over the dictionary passed as the value and adding each key-value pair as a string to the command list. However, it is incorrectly adding quotes around the values, leading to the assertion errors in the test cases.

## Bug
The bug is caused by the use of formatting with double quotes around the value in the command list. This causes the assertion errors, as the test cases expect the values without quotes.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes from the string formatting when adding the key-value pairs to the command list.

## The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
