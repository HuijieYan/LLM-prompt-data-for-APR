The bug in the provided function is that it is adding quotation marks around the property value when constructing the command. This is not the expected behavior according to the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we should remove the quotation marks around the property value when constructing the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
