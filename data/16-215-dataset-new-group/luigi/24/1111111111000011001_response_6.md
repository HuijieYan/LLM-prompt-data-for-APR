The issue in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the reassignment of the `value` variable inside the for loop, which overwrites the initial value of `value` that was passed in as an argument. This causes the function to improperly handle the input dictionary and result in an incorrect `command` list being returned.

To fix this issue, the reassignment of `value` inside the for loop needs to be changed to a different variable name, such as `v`, to avoid overwriting the original input parameter value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the input dictionary and generate the correct `command` list. It should pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
