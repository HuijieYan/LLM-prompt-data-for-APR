The buggy function _dict_arg has a bug that causes the command list to not be properly constructed. The bug occurs when iterating over the dictionary values and constructing the command list. The bug is caused by the inner loop variable also being named "value", which causes it to overwrite the outer loop variable and results in the incorrect construction of the command list.

To fix the bug, we should rename the inner loop variable to something other than "value" to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable. Additionally, we should also handle the case where the value is not a dictionary and return an empty list in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # rename the inner loop variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the inner loop variable to "prop_value" and returning an empty list if the value is not a dictionary, we ensure that the command list is constructed correctly and the bug is fixed.
