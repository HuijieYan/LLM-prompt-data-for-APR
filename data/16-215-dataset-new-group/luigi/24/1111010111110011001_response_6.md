The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values in the command list. The current implementation places values in double quotes, which causes the test to fail when comparing against the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function should format the dictionary values without double quotes and ensure that non-dictionary values are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will format dictionary values without double quotes and handle non-dictionary values correctly.

The corrected function should pass both failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
