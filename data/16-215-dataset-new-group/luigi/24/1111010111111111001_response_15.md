The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly adds quotes around the value when creating the command list. This causes the failing tests to compare the incorrect list (with quoted values) to the expected list (without quoted values), resulting in an assertion error.

To fix the bug, remove the quotes around the value when appending to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary quotes around the value when constructing the command list, which should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
