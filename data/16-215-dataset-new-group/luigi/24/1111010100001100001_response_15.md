The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not handling the input dictionary correctly to create the command list. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the dictionary input into a list of command arguments. It is not properly handling the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, we should iterate through the dictionary correctly and format each key-value pair as a command argument in the list. We can use f-strings to simplify the formatting process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name to val to avoid shadowing the input value variable
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={val}"']  # Use f-string for formatting
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list from the input dictionary.
