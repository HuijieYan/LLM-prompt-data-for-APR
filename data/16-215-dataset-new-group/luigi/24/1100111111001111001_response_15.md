The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary values and adding them to the command list. The bug causes the function to incorrectly construct the command list when the input is a dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the dictionary values are properly formatted as strings and added to the command list in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'val' to prevent variable masking
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed 'value' to 'val' to reference the variable inside the loop
    return command
```
In the corrected version, we ensure that the dictionary values are properly formatted as strings and added to the command list in the correct format.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
