The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to build a command list based on a dictionary of key-value pairs. However, there are two issues in the function that caused the failing tests:

1. The function overwrites the input parameter `value` with the loop variable `value`, leading to incorrect command construction.
2. The function wraps the key-value pairs in double quotes, which is unnecessary and incorrect for command-line arguments.

To fix the bug, the function should use a different variable name for the loop variable and remove the unnecessary double quotes in the command construction.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the loop variable has been changed to `val` to avoid overwriting the input `value`. The command construction now correctly formats the key-value pairs without unnecessary double quotes.
