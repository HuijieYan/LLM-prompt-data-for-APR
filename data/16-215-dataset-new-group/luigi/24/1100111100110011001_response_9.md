The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is adding double quotes around the property and value pairs in the command list. This is not expected behavior as the property-value pairs should not be enclosed in double quotes. This is causing the test to fail because the expected and actual output do not match due to the presence of double quotes in the actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the double quotes and uses the format `--{property}={value}` to generate each command element. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected output for the given test cases.
