The issue with the function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly formats the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as strings instead of as raw values. This causes the test cases to fail because the expected and actual output do not match due to the formatting differences.

To fix this bug, the function should format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as raw values instead of as strings.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary as raw values, which should align with the expected output and pass the failing tests.
