The issue with the buggy function is that the variable `value` is being overwritten inside the for loop, which causes the incorrect behavior. When the inner `value` overwrites the outer `value`, it breaks the loop and causes unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the for loop, so that the outer `value` is not affected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name inside the for loop to `val`, we avoid overwriting the outer `value` variable and the function should now behave as expected.

This fix ensures that the `value` variable is not altered within the for loop and the correct key-value pairs are added to the `command` list.

This change addresses the bug in the original function and should now produce the expected output for the given input values.
