The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that the function incorrectly constructs the command list for each key-value pair in the input dictionary. It does not handle the formatting of the key-value pair correctly. This results in improper command generation and causes the failing tests.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correctly construct the command list by formatting the key-value pairs in the dictionary as required for the specific command line format.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass as the command list generated will be in the correct format.
