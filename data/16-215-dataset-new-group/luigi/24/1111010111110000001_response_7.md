The issue with the given code is that it iterates over each (property, value) pair from a provided dictionary and then appends a command string to a list, where the value is enclosed within double quotes. On running the tests, AssertionError is raised as the expected command list and returned command list differ, because incorrect quotes are added during the iteration which causes the invalid comparison. 

To rectify these issues, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly structure and quote the dictionary values. One potential strategy to fix this is as follows:
1. While iterating through the dictionary, convert each property-value pair to a string with the format suitable for the actual command. 
2. Add the formatted string to the command list.
3. Return the command list after all the key-value pairs have been processed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By making the above changes, the returned command list will have correctly formatted entries without incorrect quotes that caused the comparison issues.

After correcting the function, both the failing test cases should pass successfully without raising an AssertionError.
