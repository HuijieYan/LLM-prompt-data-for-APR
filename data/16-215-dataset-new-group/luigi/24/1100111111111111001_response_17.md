The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly handling the values of the dictionary when constructing the command list. It is currently wrapping the property and value in quotes, which is causing the failing tests. The expected output should not include the quotes around the property=value pairs.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the quotes when constructing the command list. Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output for both test cases.

Here's the updated version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
