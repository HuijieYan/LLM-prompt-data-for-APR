## Analysis
The function `_dict_arg` is expected to take in a `name` and `value` as parameters and create a list `command` with the formatted key-value pairs from the input dictionary `value`. The bug seems to be related to the re-use of the variable `value` within the for loop, which overwrites the original value.

## Bug
The bug is that the variable `value` is being overwritten inside the for loop, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect formatting of the `command` list.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration inside the for loop.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
