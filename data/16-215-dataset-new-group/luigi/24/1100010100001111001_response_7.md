The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly handling the creation of the command list by not including quotes around the property-value pairs inside the list. This results in incorrect command lists being returned.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to properly format the property-value pairs with quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct command lists for the given input values.
