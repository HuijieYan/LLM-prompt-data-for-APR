Based on the buggy function and failing test code, the potential error location within the buggy function is the `command` list that is not being populated correctly with the expected values.

The cause of the bug in the `command` list is that the buggy function does not include the name in the command list for each key-value pair in the dictionary. This results in the missing `--conf` flag in the test case argument.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` needs to be updated to include the name in the command list for each key-value pair in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Include the 'name' in the command list
    return command
```

With this correction, the `name` will be included in the command list for each key-value pair in the dictionary, addressing the bug and ensuring that the failing test case will pass.
