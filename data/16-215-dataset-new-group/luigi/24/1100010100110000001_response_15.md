The bug is present in the _dict_arg function which is converting a dictionary to a list of command elements. It is wrapping all key-value pairs with quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to change the logic that wraps the prop-value pair so it doesn't have quotes around the key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]  # changed the format from '"{0}={1}"' to '{0}={1}'
    return command
```

With this change, the function `command` would now correctly represent the list of arguments without extra quotes around property and value.
This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
