The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding extra quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. The function is also overwriting the `value` variable with the inner value from the dictionary, causing incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes and store the key and inner value in separate variables. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the corrected version, the function should now return the expected output for the given input cases.
