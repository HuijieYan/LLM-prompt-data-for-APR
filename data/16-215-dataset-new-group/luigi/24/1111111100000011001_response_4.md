## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to take a `name` and `value` as input, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. If `value` is a dictionary, the function should iterate through its key-value pairs and add them to the `command` list in a specific format. However, the buggy function is not correctly building the `command` list as expected.

## Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name `value` for both the input value and the loop variable within the loop that iterates over the dictionary items. This causes the original `value` input to be overwritten and results in incorrect behavior.

## Fix
To fix this bug, the loop variable in the for loop should have a different name than the input value. This will prevent overwriting the original `value` input.

## The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
