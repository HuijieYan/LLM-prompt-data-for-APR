The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is overriding the `value` input parameter with a different value inside the loop. This is causing the function to behave unexpectedly and returning incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming value to val to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # using val instead of value
        return command
```

This corrected version of the function should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases. The key change made is to rename the 'value' variable inside the loop to 'val' to prevent it from overriding the input parameter.
