The problem with the current implementation is that the function is adding quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list, leading to the error messages seen in the failing test cases.

We can fix this by removing the quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes around the property and value pairs, and pass the failing test cases.
