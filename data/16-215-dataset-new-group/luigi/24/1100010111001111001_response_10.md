The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not including the values inside double quotes when creating the command list. This causes issues when comparing the command list with the expected values in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the values are enclosed in double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By enclosing the values in double quotes, the function now correctly constructs the command list, which should pass the failing tests.
