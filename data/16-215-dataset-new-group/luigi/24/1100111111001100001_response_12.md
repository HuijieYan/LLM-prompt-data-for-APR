The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is reusing the variable name `value` in the for loop, which causes it to overwrite the input value. This results in only the last key-value pair of the dictionary being included in the `command` list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to rename the loop variable in the for loop so that it does not overwrite the input parameter, and to create the command list with the correct format for each key-value pair in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]  # format each key-value pair correctly
    return command
```
