The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. The values are not being enclosed in double quotes as expected by the failing tests. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the dictionary key-value pairs and enclose the values in double quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
