The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments for a shell command. The error messages indicate that the function adds quotes around the `prop=value` pairs when generating the command.

The bug is in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

The cause of the bug is that the code always encloses the property value pair with double quotes.

To fix this bug, the double quotes should be removed and add them only when the value includes spaces or other special characters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            if " " in value or "\"" in value or "'" in value:
                command += [name, "'{0}={1}'".format(prop, value)]
            else:
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `prop=value` pairs will only be enclosed in quotes if the property value contains spaces or other special characters. This will fix the issue described in the failing test.
