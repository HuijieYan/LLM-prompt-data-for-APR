The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the function incorrectly formatting the dictionary values as strings with quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected command list in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly handle dictionary values by formatting them without the quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around the dictionary values, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
