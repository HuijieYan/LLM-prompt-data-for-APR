## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Explanation:
The buggy function had a bug where it was using the same variable name "value" within the for loop. This caused the function to override the input "value" and result in incorrect command generation. Additionally, the format for generating the command was also incorrect.

The corrected version of the function uses a different variable name "val" within the for loop to avoid overriding the input "value". It also uses the correct format for generating the command by using '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val) to build the command list.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
