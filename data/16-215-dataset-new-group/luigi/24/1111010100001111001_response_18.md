The bug in the function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes to the property value pairs in the command list. The function is adding `"prop=val"` to the command list, but it should be adding just `prop=val`.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the format string in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly generate the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes.
