The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly constructing the command list from the input dictionary. In the given test cases, it is expected that the function constructs a list of string elements for each key-value pair in the input dictionary, with the format `"key=value"`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to iterate through the input dictionary and construct the command list with the correct format for each key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should construct the command list correctly and pass the failing test cases.
