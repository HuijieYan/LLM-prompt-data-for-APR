To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `name` and `value` parameters are correctly added to the `command` list as key-value pairs in the format of `"{name}={value}"`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the value is enclosed in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the input dictionary as expected and pass the failing tests.
