The cause of the bug is that the function is adding quotes around the value while forming the command list, which is not expected. This is causing the assertion error in the failing test.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the quotation marks from around the value when forming the command list.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
