## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to create a command from a dictionary of key-value pairs. It iterates through the dictionary and appends each key-value pair to the `command` list. However, there is a potential error in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. 

## Potential Error
The potential error in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` is that it may not correctly format the key-value pair and append it to the `command` list.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by using `+=` to concatenate a list with another list, creating a nested list instead of a flat list of command elements.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can use the `append` method to add individual elements to the `command` list, rather than trying to concatenate lists.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
In the corrected version, we use the `append` method to add `name` and the formatted key-value pair to the `command` list, ensuring that elements are added as individual items rather than creating a nested list.
