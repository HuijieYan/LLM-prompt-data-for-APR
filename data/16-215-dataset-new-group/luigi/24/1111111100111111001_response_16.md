The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it incorrectly includes quotes around the property=value pair when creating the command list. This causes the test to fail as it expects the property=value pair to be without quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes from around the property=value pair before adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # Removed the quotes from the property=value pair
    return command
```

With this change, the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
