The error in the provided source code is in the `_dict_arg` method of class SparkSubmitTask. The "buggy" function adds double quotes around the values of the dictionary properties when constructing the command. This is not required and results in failed comparisons with the expected arguments.

The failing test results from the double quotes added around dictionary property values within the command passed to proc. This causes failed assertions when checking the call_args parameter.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

This will remove the double quotes around the dictionary property values, and the corrected version of the `test_run()` function will pass the failing test that was included.
