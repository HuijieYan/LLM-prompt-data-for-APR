The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be that the `command` list doesn't contain the `name` parameter for each key-value pair in the input `value` dict. It only includes keys and values formatted as strings.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to add the `name` parameter to the `command` list for each key-value pair in the input `value` dict.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Include the name parameter here
    return command
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass as the `command` list now includes the `name` parameter as expected.
