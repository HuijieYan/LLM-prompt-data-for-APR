The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. It is not wrapping the property-value pairs in double quotes as expected. This is causing the command list to be incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the property-value pairs in the command list by wrapping them in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will format the property-value pairs in the command list correctly, wrapping them in double quotes, and satisfying the expected input/output values for both cases provided.
