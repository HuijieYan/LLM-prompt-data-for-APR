## Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary `value` and create a list `command` based on its key-value pairs. However, the bug in the function is that it is overwriting the `value` variable with the loop variable `value` which is causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug
The bug is caused by overwriting the variable `value` in the for loop. This causes the function to use the loop variable `value` instead of the original input `value`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should change the name of the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the original function parameter. 

## The corrected version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed loop variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
