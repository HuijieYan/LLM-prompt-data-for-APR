The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The use of double quotes around the key-value string is causing the assertion to fail in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the generated key-value string to match the expected command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes here
    return command
```
