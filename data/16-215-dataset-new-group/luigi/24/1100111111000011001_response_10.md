## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed the variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function `_dict_arg` is that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the outer function parameter `value`. This causes the inner loop to use the wrong value when constructing the `command` list. To fix this, the inner loop variable needs to be renamed to 'val' to avoid conflict with the function parameter 'value'.

The corrected version of the function uses the variable `val` in the inner loop instead of `value` to properly construct the `command` list without overwriting the function parameter.

The corrected version of the function has been provided above. This version should pass both the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
