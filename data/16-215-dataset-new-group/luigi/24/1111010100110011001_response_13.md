    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by incorrectly constructing the command list. The bug occurs because the function is adding double quotes around the value in the command list, leading to discrepancies in the comparison with the expected values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, remove the double quotes when constructing the command list to match the expected values.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
