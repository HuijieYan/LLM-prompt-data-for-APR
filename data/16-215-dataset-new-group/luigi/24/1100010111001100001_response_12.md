The buggy function is intended to construct a command list based on the input dictionary. However, the bug lies in the way the function constructs the command list. The function does not handle the format of the dictionary values properly, especially when adding key-value pairs to the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. It is using double quotes and an equal sign within the value, which can cause issues when executing the command.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list by properly formatting the key-value pairs without using extra quotes or equal signs within the value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the command list in the correct format, which should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
