## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions
The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and `value`, and if the `value` is a dictionary, it constructs a command list by iterating over the dictionary items.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the function is the re-use of the variable name `value` within the for loop, leading to a conflict with the input parameter `value`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function and related functions
The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being re-assigned within the for loop, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid re-assigning the original `value` parameter unintentionally.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Changed variable names to key and val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
