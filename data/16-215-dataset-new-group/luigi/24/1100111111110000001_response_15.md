The bug involves the `_dict_arg` function which is taking an input dictionary of `name-value` pairs and converting it to a list of command arguments, which is later used in a subprocess `Popen` call. The failing tests indicate that it should convert each dictionary entry to a string in the form `"name=value"`, but the buggy function is conflicting with the failing test cases, causing the `AssertionError` due to the differing list of command arguments.

The error arises due to the mismatch in the output of the `_dict_arg` function and the expected list of command arguments in the test cases. It seems that the buggy function is erroneously creating command arguments with additional quotes that should not be there.

To fix the bug, the `value` and `command` variables should be renamed to avoid name conflicts. Additionally, the code should directly append the formatted arguments to `command` rather than using the `+=` operator, and the value should not be wrapped in quotes for an instance of a dictionary entry.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With these changes, the corrected `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing tests without any assertion errors.
