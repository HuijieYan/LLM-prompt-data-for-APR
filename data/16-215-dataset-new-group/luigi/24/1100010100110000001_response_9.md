The buggy function `_dict_arg` fails to correctly handle the dictionary values and leads to an AssertionError in the failing test. The central cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly formats the dictionary values in the command list, leading to differences between the expected command list and the actual command list.

To fix the bug, modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly prepare the command list by accepting a dictionary and directly adding its items to the list without any additional processing.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, prop, value]
    return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function to simply add the name, property, and value directly to the `command` list, the function will no longer create conflicts with the command list in the test cases.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
