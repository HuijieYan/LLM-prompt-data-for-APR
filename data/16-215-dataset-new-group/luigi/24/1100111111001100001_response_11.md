The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name inside the for loop, which causes the original value of `name` to be lost. This results in incorrect command generation. To fix the bug, we can change the variable name inside the for loop to avoid the conflict with the input parameter `name`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable val
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly generate the command list for the given input parameters, and the failing tests should pass.
