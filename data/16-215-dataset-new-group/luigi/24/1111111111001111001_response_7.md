The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command arguments. The function is iterating over the dictionary and adding the name and key-value pairs to the `command` list, but it's not formatting the key-value pairs as expected.

We can fix this bug by modifying the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs as command arguments.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will format the key-value pairs properly and should satisfy the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
