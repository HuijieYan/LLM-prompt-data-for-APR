The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not adding the double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in incorrect formatting of the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to include double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

By using f-strings in Python, we can easily format the key-value pairs with double quotes and construct the command list correctly.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
