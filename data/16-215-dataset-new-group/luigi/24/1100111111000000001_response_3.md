The buggy function is `_dict_arg` from `luigi/contrib/spark.py`, which is supposed to build a command from a dictionary of arguments, but it is not currently handling the format correctly.

The potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function are:
1. The `value` parameter is not being handled correctly and is being overwritten within the loop.
2. The formatting of the command is not being done accurately with the correct use of quotes and equal signs within the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not correctly building the command list from the dictionary of arguments. This is causing the failing tests, as they are expecting specific command structures based on the input dictionary, but the current implementation is not producing the expected commands.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should be modified to correctly format and append the command list based on the input dictionary of arguments. The function should also handle the `value` parameter correctly and avoid overwriting it within the loop.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use a different variable name (e.g., val) to avoid overwriting the value parameter
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly build the command list based on the input dictionary of arguments, and the failing tests should pass.
