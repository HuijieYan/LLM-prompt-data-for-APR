Based on the provided information, it seems that the buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. However, it has a bug in how it constructs the command list.

The bug appears to be that the function is reusing the variable name `value` within the loop that iterates over the dictionary items, which causes the initial value of `value` to be overwritten. Additionally, the function is using double quotes around the values, which may not be necessary.

To fix the bug, we should rename the loop variable to avoid overwriting the input variable `value` and remove the unnecessary double quotes around the values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list from the input dictionary.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
