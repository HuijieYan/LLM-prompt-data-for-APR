The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the input `value` parameter with a new value in the for loop, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being reused as the loop variable in the for loop, which overwrites the original `value` dictionary. This leads to incorrect command generation as the loop variable is no longer the original dictionary.

To fix this bug, we can simply use a different variable name for the loop variable in the for loop, so it does not overwrite the original `value` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using a different variable name for the loop variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
