The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is adding quotation marks around the property=value pairs in the command list when creating command strings for dictionary values. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected command list does not contain these extra quotation marks.

To fix this bug, we should remove the quotation marks from the property=value pairs when adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quotation marks around the property=value pairs, satisfying the expected input/output values.
