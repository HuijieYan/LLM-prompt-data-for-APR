The bug is caused by the _dict_arg function not handling the dictionary values correctly. It is adding double quotes around the property=value pair which is causing the test to fail due to the mismatch in the expected and actual values. The fix for this bug is to remove the double quotes from around the property=value pair in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
