The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments, but there are a couple of issues that need to be addressed.

The first issue is that the function modifies the `value` parameter, which could cause unexpected behavior if `value` is used elsewhere in the code. This can be fixed by using a different variable name to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

The second issue is that the command is being constructed incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect list of command-line arguments being returned. The function is supposed to construct a list of key-value pairs in the format `name="value"`, but it's currently producing a list of strings with spaces in between the key and value.

The cause of the bug in the test code is that the `proc.call_args[0][0]` does not match the expected list of command-line arguments. This mismatch is likely due to the buggy function `_dict_arg` not generating the correct list of arguments.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should construct the command by appending each key-value pair in the correct format to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [f'{name}={val}']
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should construct the command in the correct format.

After making this change, the failing test should be executed again to ensure that the corrected function now produces the expected list of command-line arguments.
