The problem here is in the `_dict_arg` method of the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. When the `_dict_arg` method gets a dictionary, it constructs a command of the form `[name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The error occurs because within the `value` of the dictionary, the property and value are always being concatenated with quotes, but in the failing tests, the quoted value is causing the discrepancy when compared to the expected value (without the quotes).

Based on the error messages, the problem seems to arise from the fact that the `_dict_arg` method is not formatting the dictionary items correctly.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to check the value type in the `value.items()` loop and only include quotes around the value (if it's a string) before adding it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            if isinstance(v, str):
                # Include quotes around value if it's a string
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, v)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass as it accounts for the cases where the value is not a string.
