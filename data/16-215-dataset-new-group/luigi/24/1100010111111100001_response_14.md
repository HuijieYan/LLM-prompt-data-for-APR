The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary formatting of the dictionary values as strings. This results in the `"` characters being included in the command list, causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected and actual command lists.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary formatting of the dictionary values as strings and simply append the `name`, `prop`, and `value` directly to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, prop, str(value)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the unnecessary string formatting has been removed, and the function should now return the command list without including the unnecessary `" "` characters. This will resolve the issue with the failing test cases.
