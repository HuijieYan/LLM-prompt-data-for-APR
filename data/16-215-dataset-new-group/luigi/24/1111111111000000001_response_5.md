The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class has a bug that causes it to generate an incorrect command list. The bug occurs when constructing the command list from the input dictionary `value`. The function iterates through the dictionary and appends the key-value pairs to the `command` list without considering the `name` parameter passed to the function.

The buggy function iterates over the dictionary items, but it doesn't include the `name` prefix in the command list that it appends. This omission leads to an incorrect command list construction.

A more accurate command list construction could involve prefixing each item with the `name` argument before appending it to the `command` list.

Another potential source of improvement could be refactoring the function to have better parameter names that reflect their usage more clearly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

By using the modified `_dict_arg` function, the correct command list will be generated when the function is called. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
