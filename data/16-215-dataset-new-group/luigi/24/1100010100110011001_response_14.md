The issue with the provided function is that it incorrectly quotes the values passed to the command list. This causes the test cases to fail, as the expected values do not match the actual values due to the incorrect use of quotes in the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes from the function when generating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around `{0}={1}`, we ensure that the command list is generated correctly with the expected values. This change will fix the bug and make the function return the correct command list, thus passing the failing test cases.
