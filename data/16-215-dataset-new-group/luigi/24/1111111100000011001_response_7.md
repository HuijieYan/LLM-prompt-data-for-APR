The bug in the function\_dict_arg is that it is reusing the variable name "value" in the for loop, which overwrites the original "value" parameter. This causes incorrect behavior and incorrect command generation. 

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed variable name from "value" to "val"
    return command
```
