The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the use of the same variable "value" to represent both the input value and the value of each item in the dictionary. This causes the second value to overwrite the first one, resulting in incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we can use a different variable to represent the value of each item in the dictionary. Additionally, we should remove the double quotes around the {0}={1} format in the command.append statement.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
