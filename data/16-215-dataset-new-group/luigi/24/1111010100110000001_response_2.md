### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is taking in `name` and `value` as input and constructing a `command` list. It iterates over the dictionary value and constructs a command list where it adds `name`, key-value pairs in a stringified format to the `command` list if the value is a non-empty dictionary.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error here is in processing key-value pairs within the dictionary and forming the command list.

### Explanation of the Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function `_dict_arg` trying to add the key-value pairs to the command list as stringified format which is not consistent with the expectations from the test. This inconsistency leads to a difference in the actual and expected lists.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly appended without any unnecessary string formatting and quotes. Additionally, it should also consider the possibility of an empty dictionary `value`.

### The Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```
