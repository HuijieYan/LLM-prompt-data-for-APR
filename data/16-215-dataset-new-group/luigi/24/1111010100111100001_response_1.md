The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be caused by the way it handles dictionary values. The function is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property and value when appending them to the `command` list, resulting in extra quotation marks in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotation marks and simply construct the command as a list of strings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the `command` list without adding extra quotation marks, and the tests should pass as expected.
