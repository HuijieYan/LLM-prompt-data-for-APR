### Bug Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, the function has a bug where it is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the command list, resulting in incorrect command arguments.

The bug occurs in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
The bug lies in the construction of the command list, where the key-value pairs are not separated properly and are enclosed with unnecessary double quotes.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the generated command list to contain incorrect key-value pairs, resulting in failed assertions in the test functions.

### Bug Fix
We need to fix the way key-value pairs are added to the command list, removing the unnecessary double quotes and properly separating the key and value. We should also handle cases where the value might contain spaces or special characters.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes and properly separates the key and value within the command list.

After making these changes, the `_dict_arg` function should now properly handle dictionary input and generate the correct command list. This should ensure that the failing test cases pass with the corrected implementation.
