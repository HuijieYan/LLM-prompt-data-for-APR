The buggy `_dict_arg` function is designed to handle dictionary inputs and prepare a list of command strings. It adds to the `command` list, an element for each key-value pair along with the argument `name`. However, the bug is related to the fact that it is wrapping the values in double quotes, which is causing the failing tests due to the assertions on the command line arguments using exact string matching.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_dict_arg` function to remove the double quotes around the value while forming the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
This modified version of the function will remove the double quotes around the dictionary values and provide a corrected command list which can be tested successfully.

With the modified version of the `_dict_arg` function, the failing test cases should pass without any assertion error.
