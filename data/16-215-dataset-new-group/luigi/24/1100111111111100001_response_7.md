The issue in the buggy function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the `command` list. This results in the `AssertionError` in the failing tests because the expected and actual strings do not match due to the difference in formatting.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotes when formatting the property-value pair and avoid adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass without any `AssertionErrors`.
