Upon analyzing the given buggy function along with the corresponding failing test and error messages, it is observed that the `_dict_arg` function inside the `SparkSubmitTask` class is not properly processing the arguments to create a command. The failing tests show that there are discrepancies in how the arguments are being constructed. This relates to the error message regarding differing list elements and a long diff that indicates incorrect processing of the properties and values.

To address this issue, the `_dict_arg` function should be revisited to ensure that it correctly parses the arguments and their values. This may involve verifying the way arguments are added to the `command` list, especially when dealing with dictionary items.

Given this analysis, here's the corrected implementation of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend(["{}={}".format(prop, val)])
    return [name] + command
```

The corrective action includes using the `extend` method to apply properties and values to the `command` list, and using the correct string formatting to include property-value pairs as a single entity instead of separate items. This rectified version of the `_dict_arg` function should address the issues stated in the failing tests and error messages.
