The issue with the buggy function is that it is adding double quotes around the value in the command list. The value should not have double quotes around it while formatting the command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to remove the double quotes from around the formatted value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
