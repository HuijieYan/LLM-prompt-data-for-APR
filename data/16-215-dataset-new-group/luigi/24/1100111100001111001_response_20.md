The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into strings to be added to the command list. The values are not being enclosed in double quotes as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the formatting of the key-value pairs to include double quotes around the values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` instead of `value` for the value in the loop, we prevent overwriting the outer `value` parameter. Additionally, we enclose the value in double quotes within the format string to ensure the expected output.
