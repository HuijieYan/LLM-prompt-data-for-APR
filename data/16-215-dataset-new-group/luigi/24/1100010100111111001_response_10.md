Based on the error messages and the provided runtime and expected values, the bug in the function _dict_arg is that it is incorrectly creating the command list. It is adding quotes around the property and value when it's only necessary to add quotes around the entire string for each property-value pair.

The function needs to be updated to format the property-value pairs correctly before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the property-value pairs will be formed correctly, and quotes will be added around the entire string for each property-value pair.

This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
