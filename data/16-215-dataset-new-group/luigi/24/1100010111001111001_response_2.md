The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it fails to properly format the dictionary key-value pair into a command list. The current implementation is missing the quotes around the values, and it is not separating the key-value pairs with an equals sign.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _dict_arg function to properly format the dictionary key-value pairs into a command list before returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The key change here is within the for loop, where we're using "val" instead of "value" as the variable name to represent the value of the dictionary key-value pair. Additionally, we are using "val" to properly represent the value and enclosing it within double quotes.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
