The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the values of the input dictionary correctly. The current implementation is causing the values to be quoted incorrectly and is not handling the equal sign between the property and value properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the dictionary input into a list of command arguments, especially when dealing with the equal sign between the property and value.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the dictionary items, properly format the property and value, and add them to the command list without quoting the entire property=value pair.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use val instead of value to avoid variable name collision
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove the quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly format the dictionary input into a list of command arguments, without incorrectly quoting the property=value pairs. This should fix the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
