The issue with the current implementation is that the `value` in the dictionary is not being appended to the `command` list properly. Instead of wrapping the `prop=value` pair in double quotes, it's wrapping the entire pair including the equal sign. This is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the `prop` and `value` pairs are being appended to the `command` list. The corrected version should wrap only the `value` in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version ensures that the `prop=value` pair is properly handled and appended to the `command` list. Now, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
