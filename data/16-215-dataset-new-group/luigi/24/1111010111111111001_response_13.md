The issue with the buggy function is that it is adding double quotes around the property values in the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail as they expect the property values to be added to the command list without quotes.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to add the property values to the command list without quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the expected input/output values will be satisfied, and the failing test cases should pass.
