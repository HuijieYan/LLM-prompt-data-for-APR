The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by unnecessary formatting of the dictionary values as strings, resulting in an incorrect command list. The functions misinterpret the input as a string, leading to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output, as shown in the error messages.

The bug can be fixed by removing the unnecessary formatting of the dictionary values as strings when constructing the command list.

I suggest updating the `_dict_arg` function as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Fix the bug here by removing unnecessary string formatting
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary string formatting when constructing the command list, the function ensures that the command list is correctly populated with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

With this correction, the fixed `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing tests.
