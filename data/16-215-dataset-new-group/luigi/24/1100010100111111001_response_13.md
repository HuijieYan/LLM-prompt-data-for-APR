The issue with the buggy function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs for command-line arguments when constructing the `command` list. This is causing the test to fail because the constructed command does not match the expected command.

To fix this, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs in the `command` list, which should make the function return the expected command list and pass the failing tests.
