The bug in the code occurs due to the following reason:

In the buggy function `_dict_arg`, the bug is caused by the use of a list to store the command while not taking into consideration that some values could be of type `str` instead of `dict`. The code is enclosed in quotes and treated as a string in the assertion check which doesn't match the list produced before. 

Suggested strategy to fix the bug:
- Check if the value is an instance of `dict` and if yes, concatenate the key-value pair to the command list with proper formatting.
- If not, then only the value should be added to the command.
- Instead of including the key and value in different elements of the list, they need to be combined into a single element before appending to the command list.


Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]  # combine key and value together
    else:
        command.append(name)  # add the value only to the command
    return command
```
After incorporating this change, the function should pass the failing tests.
