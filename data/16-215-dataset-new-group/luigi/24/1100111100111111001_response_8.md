The cause of the bug is that the function is adding unnecessary double quotes to the values when constructing the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the format string used to construct the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
