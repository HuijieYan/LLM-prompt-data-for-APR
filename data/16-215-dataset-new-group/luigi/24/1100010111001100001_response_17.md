The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable, causing incorrect behavior when constructing the `command` list. The `value` variable representing the dictionary input is being redefined in the `for` loop, leading to unexpected results in constructing the `command` list.

To fix the bug, the variable representing the inner loop value should be renamed to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter. Additionally, the command should be constructed in a different format that separates the property and value without using quotation marks around the entire key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # construct the command without using quotation marks
    return command
```

With these changes, the corrected function should properly construct the `command` list as expected.
