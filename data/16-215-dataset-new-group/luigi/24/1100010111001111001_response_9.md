Based on the analysis, it appears that the bug lies in the way the function constructs the `command` list. The function is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs to be added to the command list.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly constructs the command list, resulting in unexpected formatting of the key-value pairs in the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should properly format the key-value pairs before adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should properly format the key-value pairs and construct the command list as expected, passing the failing tests and satisfying the expected input/output values.
