        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Change 'value' to 'val' to avoid overwriting the value parameter

```

### Explanation of the bug
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to create a list of command arguments based on a given dictionary `value`. The bug occurs because the function unnecessarily wraps each property value in double quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the tests.

The failing tests indicate that the properties and their values should not be enclosed in double quotes. This is the cause of the assertion errors in both test cases.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the dictionary `value` and create a list of command arguments without enclosing the property values in double quotes. This can be achieved by removing the unnecessary quotes when constructing the command list.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove double quotes to avoid quoting each property value
    return command
```

After applying the fix, the function should pass both failing tests by correctly constructing the list of command arguments without enclosing the property values in double quotes.
