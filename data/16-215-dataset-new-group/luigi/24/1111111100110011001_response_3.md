The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs from the `value` dictionary. The expected output for each key-value pair should not include the double quotes around the value, but the current implementation mistakenly adds them.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to format the key-value pairs without adding the double quotes around the value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
