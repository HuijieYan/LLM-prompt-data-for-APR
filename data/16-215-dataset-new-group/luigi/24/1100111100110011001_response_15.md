The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the use of the same variable `value` for two different purposes. Once as the parameter and then as an iteration variable. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable for iteration and assign it the original value of `value` for consistency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
