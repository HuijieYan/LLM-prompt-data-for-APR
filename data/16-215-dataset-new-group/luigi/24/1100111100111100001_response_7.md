The buggy function is `_dict_arg` which is supposed to take a name and a dictionary of values and return a list of commands based on the input values. From the error messages provided, it seems like the value from the dictionary is not being formatted correctly when added to the command list.

The issue in the buggy function is with the formatting of the dictionary values when adding them to the command list. The bug causes the function to incorrectly format the dictionary values, leading to assertion errors in the test cases provided.

To fix the bug, the function needs to modify the way it constructs the command list. Instead of using double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs, it should simply add the key-value pairs without quotes to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list, and the failing tests should pass with this corrected implementation.
