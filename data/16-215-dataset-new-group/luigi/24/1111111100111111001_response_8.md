The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it's adding extra quotes to the values in the `command` list.

The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes a `name` and a `value` as input. If the `value` is a dictionary, it iterates through its items, formatting each key-value pair as a string with double quotes, and adding it to the `command` list. However, it's incorrectly adding extra quotes around the formatted key-value pair.

The cause of the bug is that the values are being formatted with extra quotes, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual values during comparison.

To fix the bug, the extra quotes should be removed from the formatted key-value pairs before appending them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the formatted key-value pairs are not enclosed in double quotes, which aligns with the expected values. The extra quotes have been removed, and the function should now handle the input correctly.
