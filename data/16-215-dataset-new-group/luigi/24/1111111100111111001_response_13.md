The issue in the buggy function is that it is adding quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list. This is causing the failing tests because the expected command list does not include the quotes.

To fix the bug, we should remove the quotes from around the property=value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes from around the property=value pairs, the function will now generate the correct command list, and the failing tests should pass.
