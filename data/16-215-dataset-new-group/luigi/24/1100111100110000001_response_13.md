### Bugs within the buggy function
The "_dict_arg" function from luigi/contrib/spark.py file is expected to convert dictionary arguments to a list, but an error is occurring when processing a key-value pair.

### Cause of the bugs
* It seems that the issue is caused by attempting to express the dictionary value as a string to build the command list.
* The bug is resulting in an incorrect command being formed, which is causing the failing test.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
Modify the function to correctly process the dictionary keys and values and build the command list without concatenating the parameters as strings.

### Updated/Copied the corrected version of the buggy function below
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# updated version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Corrected variable name from value to val
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Changed the formatting to create a list of command elements
    return command
```
With these changes, the issues are addressed by converting the command parameters directly from a dictionary to correctly build the command list.
