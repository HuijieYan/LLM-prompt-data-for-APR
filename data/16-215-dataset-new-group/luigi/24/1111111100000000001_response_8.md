## Potential Errors
The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is the use of the variable name `value` in both the parameter and the loop. This can lead to confusion and incorrect behavior. 

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by reusing the variable `value` in the for loop inside the `_dict_arg` function. This leads to confusion as the loop variable overrides the function parameter `value`, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable in the for loop inside the `_dict_arg` function. This will prevent the confusion between the loop variable and the function parameter.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
