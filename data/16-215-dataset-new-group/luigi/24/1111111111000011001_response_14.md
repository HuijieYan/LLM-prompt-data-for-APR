The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` argument with the inner loop value. This causes the function to incorrectly generate the `command` list, resulting in incorrect behavior and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, each inner loop variable needs to be distinct from the outer loop variable to prevent overwriting. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to use different variable names for the inner loop and the outer loop.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the inner loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
