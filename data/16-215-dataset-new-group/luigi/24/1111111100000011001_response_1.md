The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable `value` is being overwritten within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. The buggy function is intended to take a name and a dictionary of properties and values, and then construct a command list based on these inputs. However, the loop inside the function is reusing the variable name `value`, which is causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable inside the function. Using a different variable name will prevent the overwrite of the input `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name inside the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will no longer overwrite the input `value` variable and will properly construct the command list based on the input dictionary. This corrected version of the function will satisfy the expected input/output values for both test cases provided.
