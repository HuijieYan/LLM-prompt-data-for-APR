The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a name and value and return a command list based on the value, but it has a naming conflict with the variable `value` inside the for loop. This conflict may lead to incorrect results or errors in the output.

To fix the bug, we should rename the variable `value` inside the for loop to avoid the naming conflict with the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variable inside the for loop to `val`, it eliminates the naming conflict with the input parameter `value`, and the function should now return the correct command list based on the input value.

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass as there won't be any conflict with the variable names.

Hope this helps!
