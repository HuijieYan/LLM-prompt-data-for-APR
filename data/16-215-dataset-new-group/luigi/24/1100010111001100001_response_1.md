The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly handling the input dictionary to create the command list. The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to iterate through the dictionary and properly format the key-value pairs into the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `{0}={1}` format, the key-value pairs will be correctly formatted into the command list.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
