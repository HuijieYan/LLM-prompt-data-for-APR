The buggy function in the given source code is `_dict_arg()`, which is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. This function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments, with the correct formatting. However, the bug occurs when constructing the command list in the `if` block, where the same variable name `value` is used for iterating through the dictionary items and for appending formatted strings to the `command` list.

This results in reassignment of the `value` variable, causing loss of reference to the original value from the outer scope. As a result, incorrect arguments are added to the `command` list, leading to failures in test cases.

To fix this bug, the variable name used for iteration should be different from the variable name used in the outer scope. Also, there should be a check to validate the input dictionary, for cases where `value` might be empty or not a dictionary.

A corrected version of the `_dict_arg()` function is provided below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```

With the updated function, the input dictionary, if it's not empty and is indeed a dictionary, will be correctly formatted into a list of command arguments. This should resolve the bug and enable the test cases to pass successfully.
