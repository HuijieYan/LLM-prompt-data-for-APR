The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. Instead of formatting the dictionary values as `prop=value`, it is currently formatting them as `"prop=value"`. This is because it is adding quotes around the entire `prop=value` string.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to remove the quotes around the string `"prop=value"`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
