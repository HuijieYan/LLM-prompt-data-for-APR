The bug in the provided function is that it's adding double quotes around the property value when creating the command list, causing the failing test cases. This is evident from the error message showing a mismatch between the expected and actual values, specifically with the presence of double quotes in the actual values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to remove the double quotes when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the provided failing test cases should pass successfully.
