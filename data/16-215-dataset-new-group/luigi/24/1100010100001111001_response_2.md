Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided input/output values, it seems there is an issue with the construction of the `command` list. The problem lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The issue is that the value of 'name' is being interpreted as a separate argument rather than as part of the string format.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the values are being appended to the `command` list. We can modify the line to ensure that 'name' is included as part of the string format. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} \"{prop}={val}\"")
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list by including the `name` as part of the string format. This should satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
