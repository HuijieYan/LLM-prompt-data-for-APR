The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the input dictionary and its key-value pairs. The current implementation is not properly constructing the command list when iterating through the dictionary. Instead of building the list with individual items for each key-value pair, the buggy function is constructing a single string for each pair and adding it to the command list. This results in an incorrect command list that does not match the expected command structure.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to correctly iterate through the dictionary and add individual items for each key-value pair to the command list. This can be achieved by constructing the items with the format name and prop, which represents the key, and value, as the individual item for each key-value pair.

The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected version handles the dictionary input properly by constructing the command list with individual items for each key-value pair, following the correct format for the command structure. This will ensure that the command list matches the expected structure, passing the failing tests.
