The `TestSparkSubmitTask()` and `TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask()` classes are likely intended to call the `_dict_arg` function in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module, which constructs a command based on a dictionary of properties and values. The buggy function `_dict_arg` has a potential bug on line 8 with `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This could be corrected by changing `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)])` in order to properly concatenate the list. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)])
    return command
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly handle the properties and values passed in the dictionary and construct the command list as expected. This should resolve the issue and allow the test functions `TestSparkSubmitTask()` and `TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask()` to run successfully, passing the failing tests.
