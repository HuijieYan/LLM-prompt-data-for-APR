The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly adds quotation marks around the property and value while creating the command list. This causes the test to fail as it expects the output without quotation marks.

To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary quotation marks from the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # Other methods...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making this change, the function should now generate the command list in the expected format without unnecessary quotation marks. This will ensure that the failing test cases will pass.
