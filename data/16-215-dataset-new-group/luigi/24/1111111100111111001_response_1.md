The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes around the property-value pair when creating the command list. This is causing the command list to be different from the expected value in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we should modify the _dict_arg function to remove the unnecessary quotes from the property-value pair when adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the unnecessary quotes here
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
