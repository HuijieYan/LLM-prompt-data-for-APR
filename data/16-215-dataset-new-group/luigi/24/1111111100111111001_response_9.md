The issue in the given function is that when building the command list, the values of the dictionary are not being formatted correctly. The values are being enclosed in double quotes when they shouldn't be, causing a mismatch with the expected values.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values, which leads to a mismatch with the expected values.

To fix the bug, the function should avoid adding unnecessary quotes around the values when creating the command list. The format should be prop=value instead of "prop=value".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This revised function should now correctly format the dictionary values without enclosing them in quotes and align with the expected values in the failing tests.
