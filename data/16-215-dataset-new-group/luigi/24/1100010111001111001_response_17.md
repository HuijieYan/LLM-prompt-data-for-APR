The bug in the _dict_arg function is that the value for each property is not being formatted correctly as a string within the list 'command'. Instead of using the format 'Prop=Value', it should be '"Prop=Value"'. This is causing the failing tests because the expected values include the property-value pairs enclosed in double quotes within the list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the property-value pairs are added to the 'command' list so that they are correctly formatted as strings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Modified to include proper string formatting
    return command
```

With the corrected version, the failing tests should pass as the property-value pairs will be formatted correctly within the 'command' list.
