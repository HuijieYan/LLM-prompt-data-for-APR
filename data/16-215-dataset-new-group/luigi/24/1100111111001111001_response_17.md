The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the way it constructs the `command` list. It is not correctly forming the key-value pairs in the command list for the dictionary input. Instead of formatting the key-value pairs as `prop=value`, it formats them as `"prop=value"`, causing the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, the `_dict_arg` function needs to correctly format the key-value pairs and append them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This version properly constructs the `command` list with the correct key-value pairs, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
