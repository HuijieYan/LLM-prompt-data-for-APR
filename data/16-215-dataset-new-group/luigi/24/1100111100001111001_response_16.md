The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. Instead of surrounding each key-value pair with double quotes, it is only surrounding the whole key-value pair in double quotes. This causes the command list to be incorrectly formatted.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly format each key-value pair into the command list by surrounding each pair with double quotes individually.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
