The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the property-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list. The function is currently using single quotes around the property-value pairs, which is not the expected format.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is using single quotes instead of double quotes when adding the property-value pairs to the `command` list. This results in an incorrect format for the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should use double quotes around the property-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
