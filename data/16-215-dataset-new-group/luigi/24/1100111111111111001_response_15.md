The bug in the given function `_dict_arg` is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary items into a list of command arguments. The values from the dictionary should be added without double-quotes, and the string formatting should be adjusted accordingly.

The bug is causing the test cases to fail because the actual output of the function does not match the expected output, leading to assertion errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly format the command arguments from the dictionary items without unnecessary quoting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, both of the failing test cases are expected to pass as the function will now correctly generate the command arguments as expected.
