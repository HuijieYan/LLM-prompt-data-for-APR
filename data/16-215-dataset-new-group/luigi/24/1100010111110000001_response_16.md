## Fixing the bug

Looking at the provided buggy function, the issue appears to be in the `_dict_arg` method, which is supposed to convert a dictionary into a flattened list of command arguments. However, when a value within the dictionary contains an equals sign, the function incorrectly quotes the argument, leading to the differing elements observed in the error messages. 

The bug's cause is that the function adds double quotes around the values that contain an equals sign. This is not required for command-line arguments in the `subprocess.Popen` call, and is causing the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, the `if` condition in the `_dict_arg` method needs to be updated to correctly generate command lists and avoid quoting the argument values unnecessarily.

## The corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Using this updated function, the error messages from the failing tests should now be resolved.
