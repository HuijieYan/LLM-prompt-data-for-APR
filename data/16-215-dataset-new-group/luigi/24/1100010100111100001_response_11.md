The cause of the bug is that the function is adding double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list, causing the test cases to fail. The function is erroneously adding double quotes around the property-value pair if the input value is a dictionary.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the double quotes when adding the property-value pairs to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove the double quotes
    return command
```
