## Analysis
The function is intended to take a dictionary as input and return a list of command-line arguments. It iterates through the dictionary and appends key-value pairs to the command list in the format `"name='prop=value'"`.

## Identifying potential error locations
The issue seems to stem from reusing the variable name `value` in the loop within the function `_dict_arg`. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten.

## Cause of the bug
The variable `value` is being reused in the loop, causing the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can simply use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  
    return command
```
