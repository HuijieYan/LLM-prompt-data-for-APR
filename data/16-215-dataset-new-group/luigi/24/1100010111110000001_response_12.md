The bug in the `_dict_arg` function causes the input argument to be quoted when appending to the `command` list, leading to mismatched strings in the test assertion.

The bug is in the `_dict_arg` function where values from the input dictionary `value` are unnecessarily wrapped in double quotes. This causes the strings to be quoted when they are being added to the `command` list. As a result, the strings in the `command` list do not match the expected command list in the test, which leads to test failures with AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should append the values from the input dictionary to the `command` list as raw strings without quoting.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the test should pass without any assertion errors.
