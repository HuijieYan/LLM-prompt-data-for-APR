The potential error in the provided function is that the variable name `value` is being reused for the loop iteration, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the use of double quotes around the "{0}={1}" format could be causing issues when the command is constructed.

The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being overwritten within the loop, and the format of the command concatenation may not be correct.

To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable to something different than `value`, and construct the command in a more clear way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} {key}={val}")
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we use distinct variable names `key` and `val` to avoid reusing `value`, and construct the command using string interpolation for better readability.
