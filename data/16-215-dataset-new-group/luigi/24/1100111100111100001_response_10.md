The issue in the buggy function is that it is adding unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list. This causes the assertion errors in the failing tests because the expected and actual command lists do not match due to the presence of double quotes in the expected list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the '{0}={1}' format in the buggy function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After making this change, the function should construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, and it should pass the failing tests.
