The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. It is also not interpreting the input value correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly formatting the dictionary items into the command list. The input value is not being correctly interpreted as a dictionary, and the key-value pairs are not being formatted with the quotation marks in the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should properly iterate through the dictionary items, format the key-value pairs with quotation marks, and add them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function should now properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list.
