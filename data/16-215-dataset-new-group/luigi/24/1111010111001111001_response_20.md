The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the `command` list. Instead of using `=` to separate the key and value, the function should use a space. Another issue is that the value should be wrapped in double quotes. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to properly format the key-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0} {1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use space instead of '=' to separate key and value
    return command
```

This version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
