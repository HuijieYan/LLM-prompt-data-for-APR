The problem in the buggy function is that it is adding the property and value to the command list with quotes around them, which is not the expected behavior.

The fix for the buggy function is to remove the quotes around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now return the expected output values for all the mentioned test cases.
