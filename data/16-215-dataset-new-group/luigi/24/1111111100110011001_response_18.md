Based on the error messages and expected values, the bug in the _dict_arg function seems to be related to the way it handles dictionary items and constructs the command list. It appears that when adding dictionary items to the command list, it is not handling the formatting of key-value pairs correctly, resulting in the incorrect format in the output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is wrapping the property values in double quotes, even when they are already in the correct format. This causes the command list to contain incorrectly formatted items.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the value is already in the correct format and only wrap it in double quotes if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  
            formatted_val = f'"{val}"' if not val.startswith('"') and not val.endswith('"') else val
            command += [name, f'{prop}={formatted_val}']
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the value already starts and ends with double quotes. If it doesn't, it wraps the value in double quotes before adding it to the command list. This ensures that the command list contains correctly formatted items, as expected in the failing test cases.
