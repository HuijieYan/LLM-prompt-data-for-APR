To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The function is using the same variable name 'value' for both the input parameter and the loop variable, causing a conflict.
2. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we have renamed the loop variable from 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflicts with the input parameter. We have also removed the unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list.

This correction should resolve the issues and satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
