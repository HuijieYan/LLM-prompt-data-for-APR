This bug occurs in the `_dict_arg` method in the `SparkSubmitTask` class, under the incorrect assumption the value expected is within double quotes. This results in discrepancies when the failing test compares the output command list with the expected command list.

Additionally, there is an inconsistency in the command generated by `_dict_arg` where some values are enclosed in double quotes and others aren't, leading to the behavior which does not pass the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` method needs to be updated to not enclose the values in double quotes while assembling the command list.

The corrected version of the function `'_dict_arg'`:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
By removing the double quotes while adding a key-value pair to the command list, it fixes the problem. When the failing tests are called after this change, it should no longer show the assertion error.
