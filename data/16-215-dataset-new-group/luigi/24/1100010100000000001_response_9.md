## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function "_dict_arg" is supposed to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments. However, it seems to have a bug that prevents it from working correctly.


## Potential error locations:
1. The use of the variable name "value" in the for loop might conflict with the input variable "value".
2. The formatting of the command list might not correctly represent the command-line arguments.


## Cause of the bug:
The bug in this function is that the variable "value" is being used for both the input parameter and the loop variable. This causes a conflict and incorrect processing of the input dictionary.


## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the loop variable should be given a different name than the input parameter. Additionally, the formatting of the command list should be corrected to accurately represent the command-line arguments.


## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
