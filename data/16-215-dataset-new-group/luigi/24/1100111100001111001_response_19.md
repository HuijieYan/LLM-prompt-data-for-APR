Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is evident that the bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list within the `_dict_arg` function. The bug is present because the function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, the function should create the key-value pairs without the double quotes and then add them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format and populate the `command` list with the key-value pairs and satisfy all the expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases.
