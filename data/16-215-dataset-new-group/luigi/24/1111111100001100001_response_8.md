The buggy function is designed to accept a name and a value, and then generate a command list based on the input. It checks if the value is a dictionary, and if so, it iterates through the items and appends them to the command list. The issue seems to be with the way the properties and values are being appended to the command list, as it is missing an '=' sign and is not being formatted properly.

The cause of the bug is that the properties and values are not being formatted correctly when being added to the command list. The buggy function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs when adding them to the command list, resulting in an incorrectly formatted command list.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the key-value pairs and append them to the command list within the loop. This can be achieved by using the format method to properly format the key-value pairs and then appending them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```
