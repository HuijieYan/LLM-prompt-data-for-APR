The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. The function is currently using double quotes around the key-value pair, which is not necessary and causing the output to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes from the format string used to construct the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around the format string
    return command
```
