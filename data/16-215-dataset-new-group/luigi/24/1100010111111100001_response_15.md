## Correction

The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property value when creating the command list. This causes the test to fail as the expected command list does not contain the property values enclosed in quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotes from around the property values when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without enclosing the property values in quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
