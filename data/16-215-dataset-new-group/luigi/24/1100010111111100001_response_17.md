The bug in the _dict_arg function is due to the extra quotes being added around the property-value pair in the command list. This is causing the failing tests to fail due to the assertion errors related to the formatting of the command list.

To fix the bug, the extra quotes need to be removed from the property-value pair when adding it to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from "value" to "val" to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove the extra quotes around the property-value pair
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary quotes and should now pass the failing tests.
