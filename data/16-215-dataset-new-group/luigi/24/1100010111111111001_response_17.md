The issue with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it wraps the `value` of a dictionary with double quotes even if it's a string. This causes the failing test cases to compare the list against the expected list, leading to a mismatch due to the presence of double quotes around the values.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to check if the `value` is a string before wrapping it in double quotes. If it's a string, it should be added directly to the command list without quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Add string value without quotes
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Wrap non-string values with quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version will handle both string and non-string values in the dictionary appropriately.

With this fix, the failing test cases should now pass without the AssertionError.
