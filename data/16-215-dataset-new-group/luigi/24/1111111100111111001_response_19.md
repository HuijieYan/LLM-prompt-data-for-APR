The bug is caused by the buggy function not correctly formatting the dictionary values before adding them to the list `command`. The incorrect formatting causes the failing tests to expect a different output than what is returned.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the dictionary values in the `command` list. We also need to ensure that the key-value pairs are correctly formatted as strings.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the failing tests should pass, and the values at the function's return should match the expected values for both test cases.
