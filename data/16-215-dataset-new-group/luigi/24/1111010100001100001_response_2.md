### Explanation
The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command-line arguments. However, the function has a bug where it's not formatting the key-value pairs in the dictionary correctly. Instead of generating arguments like "--conf prop1=val1", it's generating "--conf 'prop1=val1'".

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
