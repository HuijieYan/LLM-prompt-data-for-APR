The buggy function is _dict_arg and it is part of the SparkSubmitTask class in the luigi/contrib/spark.py file.

The potential error in the _dict_arg function is with the command list. The function is iterating through the dictionary 'value' and adding the items to the 'command' list. However, it is not handling the case where the 'value' is empty or not a dictionary, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not check if the 'value' is empty or if it is not a dictionary before iterating through it and adding its items to the 'command' list.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if the 'value' is empty or not a dictionary before iterating through it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
