The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to how it handles dictionary input and constructs the command. The issue appears to be with the way the function is formatting the values from the dictionary as strings before adding them to the command list.

The function takes in a name and a value, where the value is expected to be a dictionary. It iterates over the dictionary items, formats each key-value pair, and adds them to the `command` list.

The bug occurs because the function is adding the formatted key-value pair within double quotes, which results in unexpected formatting in the command list. The quotes are unnecessary and causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs and constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed the unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should construct the command list correctly and the failing test cases should pass. This is because the command list will now be formatted without unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.
