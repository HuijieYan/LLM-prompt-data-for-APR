The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is adding unnecessary quotes around the values when creating the command list, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the values when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes from the values, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
