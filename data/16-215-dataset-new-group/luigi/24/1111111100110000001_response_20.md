The problem seems to lie in the method `_dict_arg`. The error message during the failing tests indicates that there is a difference in the constructed command compared to what is expected. This could be due to the fact that the function is incorrectly handling the value of the dictionary items when constructing the command.

To fix the bug, we should not include quotes around the values in the resulting command list. Instead, we should just add the dictionary parameters directly to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    # this is the corrected version
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By making these changes, the corrected function will use the correct format for adding dictionary key-value pairs directly to the command list. This updated approach should ensure that the command is built correctly and matches the expected outcome in the tests.
