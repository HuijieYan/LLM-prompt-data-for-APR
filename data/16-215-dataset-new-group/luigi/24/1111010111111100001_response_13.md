The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes (`"`) around the property-value pair when creating the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail as it expects the properties to be in a different format.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes and format the property-value pair correctly in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the property-value pairs and the test cases should pass.
