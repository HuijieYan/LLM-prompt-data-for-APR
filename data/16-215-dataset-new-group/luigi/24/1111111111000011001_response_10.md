To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that it correctly handles the input dictionary and constructs the command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Explanation:
- In the original code, there was a variable naming conflict where the loop iteration variable `value` was overwriting the input value of the function. This was causing incorrect values to be used in the command list construction.
- By renaming the loop iteration variable to `val`, we ensure that it does not conflict with the input value.
- Additionally, the corrected function correctly constructs the command list based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary.

The current corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
