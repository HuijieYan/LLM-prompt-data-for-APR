The cause of the bug is that the function is overwriting the `value` variable inside the loop, which leads to incorrect output. Instead of using the same variable `value` inside the loop, a different variable should be used to store the value of the dictionary items.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
