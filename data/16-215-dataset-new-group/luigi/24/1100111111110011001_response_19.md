The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable inside the function. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to use a separate variable for the loop variable inside the for loop. Additionally, we should not encapsulate the values in double quotes when constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
