It appears that the bug is in how the function builds the command list. It is not adding the values for the dictionary items in the expected format.

The fix for the bug is to modify the function to properly format the dictionary values before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
