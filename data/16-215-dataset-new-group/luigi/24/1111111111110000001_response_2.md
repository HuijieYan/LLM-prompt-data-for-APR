The buggy function `_dict_arg` seems to expect `value` to be a dictionary, and if it's not an empty dictionary it extracts a list of items from it and formats them into a new list where each element is in the format `"property=value"`. 

There seems to be a bug in the `_dict_arg` function that results in the mismatch between the expected list and the actual list. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that there is a mismatch in the property `prop1=val1` between the two lists. The failing test also indicates that the `=` sign and the double quotes are causing issues and creating mismatch.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be updated to properly handle the key-value pairs within the dictionary to ensure that the resulting list correctly represents the key-value pairs in the dictionary without any extra formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # Modified this line to properly format the key-value pairs and exclude double quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs in the resulting list, and the test case is likely to pass successfully.
