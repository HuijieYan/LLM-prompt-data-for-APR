The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the property value in the `command` list. This is causing the assertion error when comparing the expected and actual outputs of the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property value when adding it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the property value, the corrected function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing tests.
