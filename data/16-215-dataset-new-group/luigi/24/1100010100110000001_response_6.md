The function `_dict_arg` takes a name and a value, and if the value is a non-empty dictionary, it constructs the command to be used with the `Popen` method. However, the bug is occurring because in the generated command, some of the entries within the dictionary are being enclosed in double quotation marks, which is causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug:
- We need to check if the value is a string or not, and if it's a string, we need to send the value without double quotes in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Add quotes only if the value is not a string
            if not isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By adding the check for whether the value is a string and modifying the command building logic accordingly, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
