To fix the buggy function, we need to address the following issues:
1. The function is using the same variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable, causing confusion and potential errors.
2. The function is wrapping the property-value pairs in quotes, which is not necessary and causing the test to fail.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the loop variable name to 'val' to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes from property-value pairs
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned above and should pass the failing tests while satisfying the expected input/output values.
