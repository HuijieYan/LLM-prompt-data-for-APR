## Correction
The buggy function _dict_arg() fails to construct the command list correctly when the input value is a dictionary. The bug is caused by reusing the variable name for both the dictionary key and the command list. This overwrites the original value of name and causes the function to generate incorrect command lists.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable to loop through the dictionary items and create the command list. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This fix ensures that the original value of the name parameter is preserved, and a separate variable (val) is used to represent the dictionary values. With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
