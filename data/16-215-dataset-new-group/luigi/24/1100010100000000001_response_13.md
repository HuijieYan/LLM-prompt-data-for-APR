## Analysis
The buggy function appears to be a method for creating command-line arguments from a dictionary. However, there are potential errors within the function that could cause it to not work as intended.

## Potential Errors
1. The function is using the variable name "value" in the for loop, which will overwrite the input value for the function. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The function is using double quotes around the key-value pairs, which may cause issues when constructing the command.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the use of the same variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect command construction.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should rename the loop variable to something other than "value" to avoid overwriting the input parameter. Additionally, we should construct the command without using double quotes around the key-value pairs.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
