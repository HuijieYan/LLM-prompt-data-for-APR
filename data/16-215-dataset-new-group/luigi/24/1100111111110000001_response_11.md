The main error here is in the `_dict_arg` function. The function's logic adds the items of a dictionary to a command as separate strings enclosed by quotes, but the items are not always in quotes, leading to assertion errors on comparison. If the item values don't need quotes, they shouldn't be added.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '--{0}'.format(prop), str(val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will check if the value is a string; if it is, it will form the command differently, adding the parameter and value separated by `=`. Otherwise, the default behavior will be to use the behavior that was already implemented.

This new implementation should fix the failing tests while also preventing similar issues in the future.
