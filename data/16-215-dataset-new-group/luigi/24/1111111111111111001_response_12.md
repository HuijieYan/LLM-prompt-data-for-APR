The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not correctly formatting the output command list when the input `value` is a dictionary. Instead of formatting the dictionary key and value within quotes, it is only formatting the values within quotes, leading to assertion errors in the failing test cases.

The strategy to fix the bug is to update the function `_dict_arg` to correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs within quotes when building the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle dictionary key-value pairs by formatting both the key and value within quotes. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
