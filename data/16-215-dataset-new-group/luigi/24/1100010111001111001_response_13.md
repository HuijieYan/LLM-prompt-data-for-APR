The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be that it's not properly formatting the command list for dictionary arguments. It's currently adding the values as separate items in the list, but it should instead format them as key-value pairs.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters a dictionary input, it doesn't format it correctly as a key-value pair in the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the dictionary values as key-value pairs in the command list when building it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
