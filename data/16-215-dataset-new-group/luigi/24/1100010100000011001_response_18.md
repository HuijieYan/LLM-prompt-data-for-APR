## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary of key-value pairs and convert it into a list of command line arguments. However, there are a few errors in the implementation that need to be fixed.

1. The function is using the same variable `value` in the for loop, which is overwriting the input parameter `value`.
2. The format of the command being appended to the list is incorrect, causing the values to be encapsulated in additional double quotes.
3. The function does not account for the prefix `--conf` that needs to be added to each command.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is causing the function to incorrectly format the command list and overwrite the input parameter `value` during the for loop. This results in an incorrect list of command line arguments being returned.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Rename the loop variable in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`.
2. Modify the format of the command being appended to the list to remove the extra double quotes.
3. Add the `--conf` prefix to each command.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--conf', "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
