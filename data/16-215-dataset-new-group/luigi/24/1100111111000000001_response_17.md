The buggy function is `_dict_arg` which is likely causing the failing test `test_defaults` to fail. 

The function `_dict_arg` takes three parameters - `self`, `name`, and `value`. It checks if the `value` is a non-empty dictionary and if so, it iterates over the key-value pairs and appends them to the `command` list. However, the bug lies in the way the key-value pairs are being formatted and added to the `command` list. It uses the same variable `value` for both the input dictionary and the inner loop, which results in incorrect formatting and inaccurate results.

To fix this bug, we can rename the inner loop variable so that it doesn't conflict with the input `value`. We will also change the way the key-value pairs are formatted and appended to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]  # Changed the formatting and appending of key-value pairs
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly format and append the key-value pairs to the `command` list, and the failing test should pass.
