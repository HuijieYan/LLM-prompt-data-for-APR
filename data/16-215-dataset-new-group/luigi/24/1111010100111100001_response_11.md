The issue in the buggy function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property-value pair when creating the command list. This causes the test cases to fail because the expected command list does not contain these additional double quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the additional double quotes when formatting the property-value pair in the command list.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # other class code...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from "value" to "val" to avoid shadowing
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around the property-value pair
        return command
```

By removing the additional double quotes and using the correct variable names, the corrected function should now properly generate the command list without any formatting errors, ensuring that the failing test cases will pass.
