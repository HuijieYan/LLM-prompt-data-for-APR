The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly constructs the command list by adding double quotes around the key-value pairs. Also, the variable names are being reused, which leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner loop and remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes and avoid reusing variable names. This will satisfy the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
