The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it modifies the `command` list inside the loop, causing issues with the resulting command. It also quotes the key-value pairs in the command unnecessarily. We need to fix the function to correctly generate the command list without modifying it inside the loop and without unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

The issue with the initial implementation is that it iterates through the dictionary and directly modifies the `command` list by concatenating the items. This can lead to issues with the resulting command list, especially with the extra quotes around the key-value pairs.

The corrected version iterates through the dictionary and uses the `extend` method to add individual items to the `command` list. It also formats the key-value pairs without unnecessary quotes, which should generate the correct command list for the given input dictionary.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
