The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not correctly formatting the command list for the dictionary arguments. The function is supposed to take a dictionary and format it into a list of command-line arguments, but it's not doing so correctly.

The issue is that when constructing the command list, the function is adding the `name` parameter for each key-value pair in the dictionary. This is incorrect, as the `name` parameter should only be added once for the entire dictionary, not for each key-value pair.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_dict_arg` function to only add the `name` parameter once, and then iterate through the dictionary to add each key-value pair to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command.append(name)  # Add the name parameter once
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))  # Add each key-value pair to the command list
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, the tests should now pass and the command list should be formatted correctly for the dictionary arguments.
