The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list. The function is supposed to create a list of command-line arguments based on the input dictionary `value`, but it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property and value in the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to `val` to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
