The buggy function "_dict_arg" is designed to take a name and a dictionary of key-value pairs as input, and then create a command list by formatting each key-value pair as a string and appending it to the list. However, the current implementation is not correctly creating the command list as expected.

### Bug in the current implementation:
The issue lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is generating a list with the name followed by the formatted key-value pair string, but it should be adding the entire formatted key-value pair string as a single string to the command list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line that creates the command list to correctly construct the command list with the formatted key-value pair string. We can achieve this by concatenating the strings correctly rather than appending them as separate elements.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

The corrected function uses the "append" function to add the formatted key-value pair strings to the command list, ensuring that the entire key-value pair string is added as a single element. This should address the bug and ensure that the function produces the correct command list as expected.
