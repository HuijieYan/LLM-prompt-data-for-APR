The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that the loop is adding the `name` for each property, but it should only be added once before the loop. Additionally, the way the key-value pairs are being formatted is incorrect.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `name` is being added for each property, rather than just once. This results in duplicate entries in the `command` list. Furthermore, the formatting of the key-value pairs is incorrect, resulting in unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we should add the `name` only once before the loop, and use a different method to format the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command.append(name)
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected function will correctly format the parameter names and values, and produce the expected output for the given test cases. It will also satisfy the expected input/output values.
