This function encounters errors related to argument formatting for the spark-submit command. It tries to add a list of key-value pairs to the command list and outputs an error when the processed command list isn't what we expected.

The primary cause of the error seems to stem from the function's invalid handling of key-value pairs when constructing the complete parameter list for the Spark submit command. The error messages indicate that the key-value pairs are not formatted correctly on an object of the string type, which leads to list discrepancies and gives an assertion error while testing two separate classes.

To resolve the error, key-value pairs should not be enclosed in double quotes in the `command` list. Instead, the appended string should be formatted directly without quotes. The cause has been identified as the addition of double quotes within the list, causing discrepancies, which need to be removed and the plain value should be appended directly.

The corrected version of the _dict_arg function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

The corrected version should pass both failing tests.
