The bug in the provided function is that the variable `value` is being overwritten within the for loop, which leads to incorrect behavior. 

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the reuse of the variable name `value` in both the loop and the function input, which causes the function to overwrite the input `value` with its own loop variable. This leads to incorrect behavior as the loop variable `value` ends up being a string instead of a dictionary.

To fix the bug, the loop variable `value` should be renamed to something else to avoid confusion with the input parameter `value`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the loop variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use the renamed loop variable
    return command
```
