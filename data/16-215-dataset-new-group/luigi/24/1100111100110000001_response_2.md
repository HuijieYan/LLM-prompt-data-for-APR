The bug is caused by the `_dict_arg` function. The bug converts the values of dictionary elements into strings with double quotes, which is causing the assertions to fail. The `command` list should only store the key-value pairs without any formatting errors.

The `_dict_arg` function needs to be modified to remove the double quotes when storing the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version of the function uses the `.format()` method to correctly format the key-value pairs without using double quotes.

With this modified version of the `_dict_arg` function, the failing test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
