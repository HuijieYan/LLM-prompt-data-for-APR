## Analysis of the Buggy Function
The _dict_arg function is intended to take a name and a dictionary of values, and create a list of command line arguments. However, there are a few potential errors that can cause the function to not work as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The variable 'value' is being overwritten with a different value in the for loop, which can cause unexpected behavior.
2. The formatting of the command list may not be correct.
3. The function does not handle the case when 'value' is not a dictionary.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the function is caused by the variable 'value' being used to represent both the input value and the values in the dictionary, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the formatting of the command list may not be correct, and the function does not handle the case when 'value' is not a dictionary.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input 'value'.
2. Correctly format the command list with the proper syntax for command line arguments.
3. Handle the case when 'value' is not a dictionary to prevent errors.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(key, val))
    return [name] + command
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use 'key' and 'val' in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input 'value'.
2. We use the append method to add formatted strings to the command list.
3. We return the command list with the name included as the first element.

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the input dictionary and create the list of command line arguments as expected.
