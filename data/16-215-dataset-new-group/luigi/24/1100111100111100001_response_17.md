The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail.

The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes two input parameters: `name` and `value`. It iterates through the items of the `value` dictionary and adds the property=value pairs to the `command` list with the `name` prefix.

The problem arises when the buggy function adds the property=value pairs to the `command` list. It encloses the property=value pairs in double quotes, which is not expected and causes the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the enclosing double quotes from the property=value pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the property=value pairs are added to the `command` list without the enclosing double quotes, which aligns with the expected output in the failing test cases.
