The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it's incorrectly formatting the command list when building it from the input dictionary.

The bug arises from the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
The issue here is that the values for prop and value are being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily, and the entire "{0}={1}" string is also being enclosed in double quotes, resulting in double quoting of the property-value pairs.

To fix the bug, the string formatting should not be enclosed in double quotes, and the property-value pairs should not be individually enclosed in double quotes. The corrected line should be:
```python
command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
```

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
