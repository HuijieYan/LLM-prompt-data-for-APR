## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # fixed the variable name to val to avoid conflict with the input variable name
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # updated the format to use --prop=val format
    return command
```

Explanation:
The buggy function had a few issues:
1. It was using the wrong format for creating command arguments, which was causing the test cases to fail.
2. It was using the same variable name "value" in the for loop, which caused conflict with the input variable name.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues:
1. It uses the correct format for creating command arguments, using '--prop=val' format instead of '"prop=val"'.
2. It uses a different variable name "val" inside the for loop to avoid conflict with the input variable name "value".

This should fix the issues and make the test cases pass.

Expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution should now be satisfied with the corrected function.
