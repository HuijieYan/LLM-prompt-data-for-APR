The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the values from the dictionary are not enclosed in quotes as expected in the test cases. To fix this, the function needs to modify the command to include the dictionary values in quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The only change made is renaming the `value` variable inside the loop to `val` to avoid shadowing the `value` parameter of the function, and then using this `val` variable for formatting the dictionary values.

With this change, the function should now correctly format the dictionary values with quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
