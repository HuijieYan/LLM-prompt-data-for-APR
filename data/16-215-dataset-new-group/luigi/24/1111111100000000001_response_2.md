The potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function are:
1. The use of the variable name `value` in both the function parameter and the for loop within the function.
2. The use of the `+=` operator to concatenate strings to the `command` list.

The cause of the bug is that when the `value` argument is passed as a dictionary, the for loop iterates over the dictionary key-value pairs, but it uses the variable name `value` again, causing a conflict with the function parameter. Additionally, the string concatenation using the `+=` operator may lead to unexpected results.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to use a different variable name for the loop iteration and to use the `append` method to add strings to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

In the corrected version, I've used `val` as the variable name for the loop iteration in the for loop. I've also used the `append` method to add strings to the `command` list instead of using the `+=` operator.
