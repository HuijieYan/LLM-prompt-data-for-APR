The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly formatting the dictionary elements into a list with quotes around the value. This results in the failing test expecting a different format for the values within the command list.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` needs to be modified to format the dictionary elements without quotes around the value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
