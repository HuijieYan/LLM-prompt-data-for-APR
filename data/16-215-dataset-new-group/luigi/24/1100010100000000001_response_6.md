### Analysis of the buggy function:
The function "_dict_arg" is intended to convert a dictionary "value" into a list of command arguments. However, there are a few potential issues with this function. 

### Potential error locations:
1. The variable name "value" is used in two different contexts, which can lead to confusion and potentially overwrite the original "value" dictionary.
2. The string formatting in the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]" may not work as intended.
3. The function does not handle the case when "value" is empty or not a dictionary.

### Cause of the bug:
The main cause of the bug is the confusion between the two uses of the variable name "value" and the potential issue with the string formatting.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different variable name to avoid confusion and potential overwriting of the original "value" dictionary.
2. Use proper string formatting to create the command arguments.
3. Handle the case when "value" is empty or not a dictionary.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Use proper string formatting
    return command
```
