# The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val' to prevent variable name conflict
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed '"{0}={1}"' to '--{0}={1}' to match the expected test output
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues and pass the failing test cases presented.
