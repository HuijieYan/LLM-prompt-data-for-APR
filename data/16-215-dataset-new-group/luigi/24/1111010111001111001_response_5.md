The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it does not correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. The function creates a list of command arguments, but it does not include the equal sign between the key and value, and it does not wrap the value in double quotes as expected in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _dict_arg function to correctly format the key-value pairs and to wrap the formatted string in double quotes before appending it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

This corrected version formats each key-value pair in the input dictionary, wraps it in double quotes, and appends it to the command list. This should satisfy the expected input/output values and make the failing test pass.
