## The source code of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Change 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```

In the `_dict_arg` function, there is a variable naming conflict between the function input 'value' and the loop variable 'value'. This can cause unexpected behavior in the loop. Additionally, the loop variable 'value' is being used when creating the command list, which should be 'val' instead.

To fix the bug, the variable naming conflict needs to be resolved and the correct loop variable needs to be used to create the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the loop variable 'val' to create the command list
    return command
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values and types.
