Based on the input parameters, the buggy function is expected to return a list of command arguments with the format `name="prop=value"`. However, the current implementation is incorrectly adding double quotes to the values within the list. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected and actual command arguments do not match.

To fix the bug, the incorrect usage of double quotes within the list of command arguments needs to be addressed. The function should construct the command argument in the format `name=prop=value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name + "=" + prop + "=" + val]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly construct the command arguments without adding unnecessary double quotes, and it should pass the failing test cases.
