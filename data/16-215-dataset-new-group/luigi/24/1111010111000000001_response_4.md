The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class which is intended for running a Spark job. The function is supposed to convert a dictionary argument into a format suitable for inclusion in the execution command for the Spark job. However, the buggy function has a logic error that causes it to not correctly generate the command.

The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is the logic used to iterate over the dictionary for constructing the command. The value of the variable `value` is overwritten when it is used to iterate over the dictionary. This can cause the function to behave unexpectedly and produce an incorrect command.

The bug occurs because the variable `value`, which should hold a string, holds a dictionary in the buggy function. This causes the loop to overwrite the `value` variable with the dictionary values. Consequently, instead of using the original function argument for the values to construct the command, it uses values from the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we should change the variable name `value` inside the for loop to something else, so that it does not override the original input value. Also, within the for loop, we can use the `name` and `prop` variables directly to construct the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(k, v)]
    return command
```
