In the function `_dict_arg` provided, we can see that it takes two arguments, `name` and `value`, and then creates an empty `command` list. It then checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then extracts its properties. If it is a dictionary, it is appended to the `command` list in a specific format and then it is returned.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. The loop that iterates over the dictionary properties could be collecting them incorrectly or using an incorrect format.
2. The formatting of the properties being appended to the `command` list could be incorrect.

The cause of the bug in the provided function is that the values from the dictionary are not being concatenated properly in the format required. The failing test is resulting in an AssertionError because, instead of concatenated strings, the `_dict_arg` function is creating a list with string elements that look different from the format they are supposed to follow.

To fix the bug, we can create a new list of command elements by iterating over the dictionary and the properties, and then joining them into a single string before appending them to the `command` list. This way, the list elements will be in the correct format when joined together when used inside the failing test.

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]  # Joining elements into the correct format
    return command
```

By implementing this corrected version, the function now joins the elements in the expected format and will pass the failing tests provided.
