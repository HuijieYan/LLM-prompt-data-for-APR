The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name for both the input parameter and the loop variable, causing it to overwrite the original value. This leads to incorrect command construction and incorrect return values.

To fix this bug, we need to change the loop variable's name to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version renames the loop variable in the for loop from `value` to `val` to avoid overwriting the input parameter. This change ensures that the command list is constructed correctly with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

With this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary, and the identified test cases should now return the expected output.
