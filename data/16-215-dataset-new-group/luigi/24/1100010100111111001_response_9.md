The issue is that the function is adding the dictionary values to the `command` list with double quotes, which is causing the failing tests. The expected behavior is to not include the double quotes in the command list.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes when adding the dictionary values to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
