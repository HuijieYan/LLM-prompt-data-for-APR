The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values into a list of command arguments. The bug causes the values in the dictionary to be enclosed in double quotes when they should not be. Additionally, the function is not handling the case where the value is not a dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the dictionary values without enclosing them in double quotes. We also need to handle the case where the value is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the dictionary values will be formatted correctly without unnecessary double quotes, and the function will handle the case where the value is not a dictionary.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
