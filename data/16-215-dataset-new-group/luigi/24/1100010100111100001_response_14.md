The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the handling of dictionary input and the formatting of the command list. It appears that the function is erroneously converting dictionary values to strings and including unnecessary double quotes in the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail due to differences in the expected and actual command lists.

The bug is occurring because the function is adding double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, and it is also adding the equals sign as part of the value string. This is not the expected behavior and is leading to the discrepancy in the command lists.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly format the command list without unnecessary quotes and with the proper key-value structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the command list to include the key-value pairs without superfluous quotes and with the proper structure.

This should resolve the issues with the failing test cases.
