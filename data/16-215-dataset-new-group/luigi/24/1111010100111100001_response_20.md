The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the extra double quotes added to the values in the command list when building it from the input dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that when building the `command` list, the function is adding extra double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs. This is not necessary and is causing the assertion errors in the tests as the actual and expected command lists do not match due to this extra formatting.

To fix the bug, the extra double quotes should be removed when formatting the `prop=value` pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the 'value' variable to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove extra quotes here
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will build the `command` list without adding extra double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs, and the tests should pass without assertion errors.
