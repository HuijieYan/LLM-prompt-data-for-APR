## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to take a name and a dictionary of values, and convert it into a list of commands. It iterates through the dictionary and appends the name, property, and value to the command list. However, there are several issues with the function's implementation.

## Identify potential error locations
1. The function reuses the variable `value` for both the input parameter and for iteration through the dictionary. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.
2. The use of double quotes around `{0}={1}` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect formatting of the command list.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by reusing the variable `value` for both the input parameter and the iteration variable in the loop. This results in unexpected behavior and incorrect command list generation. Additionally, the unnecessary use of double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the command generation leads to incorrect formatting.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, it is essential to use a different variable for the iteration over the dictionary and to remove unnecessary quoting in the command generation.

## Corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
