After reviewing the provided source code, tests, and error messages, it is evident that the buggy function `_dict_arg` has a problem with its processing of the `value` dictionary. The parameters passed into the `value` dictionary during the test functions are not being processed properly within the `_dict_arg` function.

The problematic line appears to be the following:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

It seems that the issue arises from extra double quotes being added when combining the `prop` and `value` in the command list.

The error messages indicate that there is a failure of validation when comparing the expected command lists created by the `proc.call_args[0][0]` with the actual lists. This is due to differences in the format within the command lists, specifically regarding how the properties and values are being formatted.

To fix the bug, we suggest modifying the mentioned line of the `_dict_arg` function. Instead of adding double quotes to the prop and value when appending them to the command list, we should simplify the addition of the prop and value as strings.

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is provided below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Modified line here to append prop and value directly as string elements in the list
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly process the input dictionary and build the command list as expected based on the provided test cases. This change should address and resolve the identified error.
