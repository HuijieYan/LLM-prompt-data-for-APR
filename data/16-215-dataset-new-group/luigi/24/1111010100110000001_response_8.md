The problem is likely related to the `_dict_arg` function. This function takes a key-value pair and returns a list of arguments. We see that the comparison failures specifically refer to differing arguments of `--conf` and `--properties-file` in both test cases. These are mostly related to issues with the list returned by `_dict_arg` function.

Upon inspecting the `_dict_arg` function, we see that it does not correctly generate the arguments for dict type inputs. It fails to handle the properties correctly and adds extraneous quotes, which becomes a problem when forming the command array. The test cases are sensitive to these differences, leading to failure.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the `_dict_arg` function to properly handle the input dictionary and generate command line arguments accordingly. In this case, we need to modify the function to remove the extra quotes and consistently format the arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed extraneous quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the format of the command arguments will be consistent with the test expectations, and the failing tests will pass.
