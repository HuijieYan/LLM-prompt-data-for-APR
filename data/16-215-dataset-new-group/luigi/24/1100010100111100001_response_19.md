The issue in the `dict_arg` function is that it is adding quotes around the value when creating the command list, which is causing the test cases to fail.

The correct approach should be to add the name and prop-value pair to the command list without quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By removing the quotes from the format, the function should correctly create the command list without the extra quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
