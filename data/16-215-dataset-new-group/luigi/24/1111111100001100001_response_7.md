The cause of the bug is that the function is overwriting the value parameter in the for loop. This causes the loop to only iterate once, as the value becomes a string and no longer a dict.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration and the parameter passed to the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly iterate over the dictionary items and construct the command list as expected.
