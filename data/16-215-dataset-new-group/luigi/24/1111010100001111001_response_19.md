The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create a list of command-line arguments based on a dictionary of properties and values. However, the bug causes the function to create an incorrect command list.

The bug is caused by the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` which adds the name and value of each property to the command list as separate elements, instead of as a single element in the format `name=prop`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the line to correctly format the property and value as `name=prop`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + '=' + '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version concatenates the `name` variable with the `prop` and `val` variables using the correct format and appends it to the `command` list. This will result in the expected output for the given test cases.
