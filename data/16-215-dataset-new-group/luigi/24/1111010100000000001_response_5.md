The buggy function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The potential error location is within the for loop where the function is attempting to iterate through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary `value`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is reusing the variable name `value` within the for loop, which causes conflict with the original `value` input to the `_dict_arg` function. This results in unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, the variable within the for loop should be renamed to avoid conflict with the original input. Also, the function should handle the case where the input value is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the variable `value` within the for loop has been renamed to `prop_value` to avoid conflict. Additionally, it handles the case where the input value is not a dictionary by checking if `value` exists and is an instance of a dictionary before proceeding with the for loop.
