The buggy function `_dict_arg` seems to be converting the arguments into a list of command, but in the process, the string property is not being handled correctly.

The method `_dict_arg` expects a `name` and `value`. It processes the value only if it is a dictionary. Inside the loop that goes through each item in the dictionary, it adds to the command list a string with the name and the property enclosed in double quotes. This method likely expects that `value` will always contain the same string property format.

The failing test's error messages indicate that the problem arises when trying to compare the command list with the expected command. The pertinent issues seem to be due to the differences in the string property formats.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the property strings, and only add quotes when necessary.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '--{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, an additional check has been added to see if the value is a string. If it is, the property is enclosed with double quotes; if not, the property is added as is.

By thoroughly checking the type of the value and appropriately adding a pair of quotes and properties, this function is now able to handle various types of properties and form the command list correctly, which should resolve the failing tests.
