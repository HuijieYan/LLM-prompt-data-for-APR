The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values into strings with double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail. The expected format should not include double quotes around the key=value pair. 

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function should be updated to format the dictionary items as key=value without using double quotes. 

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
