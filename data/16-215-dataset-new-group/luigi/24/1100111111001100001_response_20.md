The issue in the buggy function is that the variable name is being overwritten in the for loop, leading to incorrect command generation. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Fix: Rename 'value' to 'val' to avoid overwriting the 'value' input parameter
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix: Use 'val' instead of 'value'
    return command
```

The buggy function failed the test cases due to the following reasons:
- The for loop in the _dict_arg function was overwriting the 'value' variable, leading to incorrect command generation.
- As a result, the command list was not being constructed correctly, causing the tests to fail.

The bug was fixed by renaming the iteration variable in the for loop to 'val' to avoid overwriting the 'value' input parameter. Additionally, 'val' was used instead of 'value' in the command construction.

With the above fix, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests provided.
