Based on the error messages, it seems that there are issues with the `argument` and `value` pairs in the `_dict_arg` function of the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. Specifically, this function seems to be double quoting certain values that should not have double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual lists.

One potential source of the problem in the `_dict_arg` function is the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
The above line of code seems to be adding unnecessary double quotes around the formatted key-value pair, resulting in double quoted strings within the `command` list.

To fix the buggy function, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the formatted key-value pair. The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val' to prevent conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes in the formatted string, the issue causing the test failures should be resolved.
