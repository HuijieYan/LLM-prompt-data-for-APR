The buggy function `_dict_arg` has a few issues that need to be addressed. The first issue is that it is using the same variable name `value` as the input parameter and also in the loop which creates confusion and overwrites the original `value` input parameter. The second issue is that the `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` should not include double quotes around the values, as they are being added to a list of command line arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly assembling the command list when `value` is a dictionary. The loop is incorrectly constructing the command list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly construct the command list by iterating over the dictionary items and adding the key-value pairs in the format `prop=value` to the command list without double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly assemble the command list when `value` is a dictionary, and pass the failing tests.
