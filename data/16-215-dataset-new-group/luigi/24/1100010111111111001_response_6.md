The bug in the _dict_arg function is in the way it constructs the command list. It incorrectly adds quotation marks to the key=value pairs in the command list, causing the test results to fail due to a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _dict_arg function to construct the command list without adding extra quotation marks to the key=value pairs. Additionally, we should ensure that if the value is not a dictionary, an empty list is returned as command.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotation marks, which will resolve the failing tests.
