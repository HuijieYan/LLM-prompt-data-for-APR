The bug in the `_dict_arg` function occurs due to the use of double quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list. The test cases are failing because the quotes are not expected to be present in the command list. The function incorrectly adds double quotes to each property=value pair in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function needs to remove the double quotes from the property=value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By returning property=value without enclosing them in double quotes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
