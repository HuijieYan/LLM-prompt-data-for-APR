The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is overwriting the `value` variable used in the loop. This causes the function to create a command list with incorrect values.

To fix this bug, we need to change the variable name in the loop. Also, we need to remove the quotation marks around the key-value pair to match the expected output of the failing test.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to val
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed quotation marks
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly generate the command list and pass the failing test.
