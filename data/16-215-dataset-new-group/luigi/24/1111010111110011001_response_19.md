The issue with the buggy function is that it is creating the `command` list incorrectly. It is adding the arguments with quotes around the values, causing the test cases to fail due to unwanted quotes in the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to create the `command` list without adding quotes around the property values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output values for the given input parameters.
