The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the fact that it is adding double quotes around the values in the command list, even when they are not needed. This is leading to a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual result in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should only add double quotes around the values in the command list when they contain spaces or special characters. Otherwise, we should add them as-is.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if ' ' in val or '=' in val or '"' in val:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should handle cases where the value may contain spaces, equal signs, or double quotes, and adjust the formatting accordingly. This should resolve the mismatch in the test cases and ensure that the function works as expected.
