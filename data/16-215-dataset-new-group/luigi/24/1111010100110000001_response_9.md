The `_dict_arg` function looks for any dictionary properties in the data and convert them to list items. In the error message, we see AssertionError validation of values where one argument is a dictionary and the other is not, leading to a list comparison error. 

The cause of the bug is that when the bug function checks whether a value is a dictionary, it just returns the dictionary properties without checking if the value in the dictionary is also a dictionary. This leads to the problem because when the properties are joined, the string 'Prop=Value' is placed in double quotes in the command list.

To fix the bug, we have to modify the `_dict_arg` function to check if the value inside the dictionary is a dictionary and format it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                if isinstance(val, dict):
                    command += [name, "'{0}".format(prop) + "={0}'".format(val)]
                else:
                    command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
