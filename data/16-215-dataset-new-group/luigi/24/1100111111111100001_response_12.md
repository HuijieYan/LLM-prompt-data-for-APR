The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the use of double quotes around the value in the command. The failing tests indicate that the values are being passed without double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values in the lists.

To fix the bug, the double quotes need to be removed when constructing the command list within the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed value to val to avoid overwriting the original value variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
