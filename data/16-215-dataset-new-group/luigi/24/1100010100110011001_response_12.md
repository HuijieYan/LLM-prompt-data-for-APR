The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value in the command list. This results in a mismatch with the expected values when comparing lists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
