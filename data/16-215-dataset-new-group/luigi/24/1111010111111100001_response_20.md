The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when forming the command list. This is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests because the expected and actual command lists do not match due to the presence of unnecessary double quotes.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the property values when forming the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the unnecessary double quotes around the property values are removed, and the function should now pass the failing tests.

This corrected version ensures that the command list is constructed without unnecessary characters and matches the expected command list in the failing tests.
