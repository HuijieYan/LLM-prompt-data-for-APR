The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when building the `command` list. This results in a mismatch with the expected output, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the unnecessary quotes should be removed from the key-value pairs when appending them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
