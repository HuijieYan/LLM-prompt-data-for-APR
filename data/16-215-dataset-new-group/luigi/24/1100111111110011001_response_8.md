The issue in the buggy function is that it does not correctly handle the input values of the dictionary and fails to construct the command list as expected. The bug is causing the comparison in the test functions to fail due to discrepancies in the constructed command list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly iterate through the dictionary items and construct the command list with the correct format for each key-value pair.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Construct the command with the correct format
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the input dictionary and construct the command list in the expected format. This should resolve the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
