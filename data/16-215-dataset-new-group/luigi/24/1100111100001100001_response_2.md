The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the outer loop variable `value`. This causes the `command` list to be populated incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we can simply change the variable name of the inner loop from `value` to something else, such as `inner_value`, to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, inner_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, inner_value)]
    return command
```
