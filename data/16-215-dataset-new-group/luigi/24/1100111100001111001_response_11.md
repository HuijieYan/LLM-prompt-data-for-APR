The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a string. Instead of creating a string with `"="` in between the key and value, it needs to create a string with just the key and value, separated by an equal sign.

The buggy function incorrectly uses double quotes when formatting the key-value pairs, resulting in extra quotes in the output. Also, it does not handle the case when the value is not a dictionary.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes and modify the formatting of the key-value pairs. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the input `value` is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should produce the expected output values and types for the given test cases.
