The main issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when building the command list. The function is wrapping the property-value pairs in double quotes, which is not expected according to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes from the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes from the property-value pairs, it should now correctly build the command list as expected by the failing test cases.

This fix should address the issue with the failing test cases and ensure that the function returns the expected values for the given input parameters.
