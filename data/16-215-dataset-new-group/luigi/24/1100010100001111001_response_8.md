The bug in the given function is related to the formatting of the command list. The function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list.

The issue is that the function is wrapping the key-value pairs with double quotes, which is not necessary. Additionally, it is using the same variable name 'value' for the inner loop, which is overwriting the original value and causing the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should simply add the key-value pairs to the command list without wrapping them with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list, without any unnecessary double quotes.

This corrected version of the function satisfies the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
