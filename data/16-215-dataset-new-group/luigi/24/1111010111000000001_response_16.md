## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class, which is part of the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. The function is meant to process dictionary arguments into a list of command line arguments for running a Spark job. However, there are several potential error locations within the buggy function, including the way it handles the input dictionary and the way it constructs the command list.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the way the `_dict_arg` function processes the input dictionary `value`. It checks if the value is truthy and if it's an instance of a dictionary, but the way it constructs the `command` list with the items from the dictionary might be problematic. This might lead to incorrect or unexpected command line arguments when launching the Spark job.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_dict_arg` function correctly processes the input dictionary and constructs the command list with the expected format for Spark job submission. This may involve handling empty dictionaries, handling special characters in property values, and ensuring the correct format of the command line arguments.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, I have replaced the use of double quotes around `{0}={1}` with the `+` operator to construct the command list in the correct format. This should fix the bug and ensure that the command line arguments are constructed properly based on the input dictionary.
