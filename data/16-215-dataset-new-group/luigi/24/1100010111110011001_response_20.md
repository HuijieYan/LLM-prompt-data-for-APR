The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding extra double quotes around the property and value when building the `command` list. This is causing the test to fail, as the expected command list does not contain the extra quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes and update the function to directly append the property and value without any extra formatting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed the variable name to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed the extra quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
