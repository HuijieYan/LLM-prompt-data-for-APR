## Analysis:

1. The function _dict_arg is intended to create a command list based on the input dictionary.
2. The potential error lies in the loop where the command list is constructed.
3. The bug occurs because the variable "value" is used both as the function parameter and as an iterator variable in the for loop, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the iterator within the for loop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable val instead of value
    return command
```
