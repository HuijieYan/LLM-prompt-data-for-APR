## Explanation
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the way the function handles the dictionary values. The current implementation adds double quotes around the property=value pair, which is causing the test failures. The expected format for the command list is to have the property=value without quotes.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property=value pair when adding it to the command list.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Fix: removed double quotes
    return command
```
