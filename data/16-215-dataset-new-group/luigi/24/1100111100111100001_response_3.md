The issue in the buggy function is that when building the command list, the function is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property value. This causes the comparison to fail, as the expected and actual values are not the same.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotation marks when adding the property and its value to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from "value" to "val" to avoid shadowing the input variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the quotation marks around the property value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now return the command list without adding extra quotation marks around the property value, and the failing tests should pass.
