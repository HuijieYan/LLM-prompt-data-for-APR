The issue with the buggy function is that it is adding double quotes around the property and value in the `command` list.

The bug is causing the AssertionError in the failing test because it is expecting the command list without the double quotes, but the function is adding double quotes to the property and value.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property and value when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes from property and value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
