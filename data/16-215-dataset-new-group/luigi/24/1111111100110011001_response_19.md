There are a few issues with the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class:

1. The function is modifying the `value` input parameter by reusing it as a loop variable, which leads to unexpected behavior.
2. In the first failing case, the function is adding double quotes around the property value, while in the second case it's not. This inconsistency causes the test to fail.

To fix this, the function should create a new list to store the commands and handle the property values consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... (other class code)

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # avoid using the same variable name 'value' as the input parameter
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # do not add double quotes here
        return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
