## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

The buggy function has two potential error locations:
1. The use of the variable name inside the for loop which overrides the input parameter name.
2. The value of each property in the command list is being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily causing a mismatch in the test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the original function is using the same variable name "value" inside the for loop which overrides the input parameter value. Also, the unnecessary use of double quotes is causing a mismatch in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the corrected function changes the variable name "value" inside the for loop to "val" to avoid the variable name conflict and removes the unnecessary double quotes when adding the property value to the command list.

The corrected version of the function is provided above. This version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
