To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to update the function to correctly handle the values of the dictionary and build the command list accordingly. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

Explanation:
- In the original function, the formatting of the dictionary values is incorrect, leading to issues when building the command list.
- The corrected function properly handles the dictionary values using the `format` method to generate the correct format for the command list.

The updated function should now pass the failing tests by correctly building the command list as expected.
