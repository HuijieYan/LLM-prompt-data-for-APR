The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it overwrites the 'value' variable in the inner for loop. The value parameter of the outer function is being shadowed by the inner loop, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can simply rename the variable in the inner loop to something else, like 'inner_value', to avoid shadowing the outer 'value' parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, inner_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, inner_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the inner 'value' variable to 'inner_value', we prevent it from conflicting with the outer 'value' parameter, and the function should now work correctly.

With this change, the function should correctly build the command list based on the input dictionary, as demonstrated in the runtime values and types of variables provided in the prompt.
