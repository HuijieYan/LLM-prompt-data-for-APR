The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is converting the dictionary items into strings with additional quotes and equals signs, resulting in the incorrect format in the returned command list. This is causing the test cases to fail as they are expecting a different format of the command list.

To fix the bug, the quotes and equals signs should be removed from the formatting of the dictionary items in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
