## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '--{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # change the format of the command string
    return command
```

Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` fails to correctly generate the command list from the input dictionary. It incorrectly formats the command string and overwrites the `value` variable, resulting in incorrect command generation. 

To fix this, the variable name `value` inside the loop is changed to `val` to avoid conflict with the outer `value` parameter. The format of the command string is also changed to ensure the correct generation of the command list.

Additionally, the corrected function uses `--` instead of `"` for the command string format, and fixes the variable naming conflict by renaming the inner variable `value` to `val`.

The corrected function addresses these issues and ensures the expected input/output values are satisfied.
