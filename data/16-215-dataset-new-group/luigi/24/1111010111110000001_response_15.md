There is a bug in the `_dict_args` method of the `SparkSubmitTask`. The method appears to be designed to convert the input dictionary into a command list for running a Spark job, but the bug is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when parsing the arguments.

The method constructs the command list `command` to return based on the input dictionary `value`. The bug stems from the way it appends key-value pairs to `command`.

Firstly, there is an issue with the quotation marks around the key-value pairs. Some parts of the test and production code expect non-quoted key-value pairs, while the current `_dict_arg` implementation adds quotes around key-value pairs.

The second issue is the resolution of the first issue and to remove the quotes around the key-value pairs if no quotes are expected.

To address these issues, you can modify the `_dict_arg` function as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Take into account that not every value requires quoting
            if isinstance(val, (str, int)):
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the updated `_dict_arg` method, the bug should be fixed without adding the unnecessary quotes around key-value pairs.

This updated function should take into account the requirement to set key-value pairs without quotes and should resolve the error in the failing test cases.
