The buggy function is `_dict_arg`, which takes a `name` and `value` as input. It checks if the `value` is a dictionary and then iterates through the items in the dictionary to create a command list. The function is intended to return the command list.

The potential error in the function is that it uses the same variable `value` in the for loop, which overwrites the input `value`. This causes the function to only consider the last key-value pair in the dictionary when creating the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly iterating through all the items in the input dictionary and creating the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should use a different variable to represent the dictionary values inside the for loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using `val` instead of `value` in the for loop, the function will correctly iterate through all the items in the input dictionary and create the command list.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
