The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the conversion of the dictionary key-value pair into a string for the command list. The buggy function is adding extra quotes around the key-value pair, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the key-value pair when adding it to the command list. The corrected version of the function should simply append the key-value pair without adding any extra quotes.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed extra quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass both failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
