I can't see the source code of the other classes and methods used in the buggy function, but we should note that the issue arises from the formation of the `command`. The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy in the structural formation of the argument list for the subprocess call.

From the given error message, the command is not being formatted correctly. Therefore, we need to ensure that when the `command` list is created using the properties and their values from `value`, the corresponding strings should be formatted without extra quotation marks and equals signs added. 

This is likely caused by the fact that there is an extra quotation mark and equals sign being added when constructing the `command` list that is causing the tests to fail. This can be fixed by modifying the way the `command` list is created and formatted.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this issue, we should avoid using double quoting and equalizing the property-value pair when adding them to the `command` list. We should format the strings in a way that they can be directly appended into the list and should not modify them to represent contained data like in the buggy code.

### A Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + "=" + val]
    return command
```
