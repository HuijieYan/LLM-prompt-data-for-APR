    # this is the fixed function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, v in value.items():  # renaming value to v to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, v)]  # removed quotes around the property=value pair
        return command
```
In the fixed version of the `_dict_arg` function, I made the following changes:
1. Changed the in-loop variable from `value` to `v` to avoid conflict with the outer scope variable.
2. Removed the quotes around the property=value pair to match the expected output from the failing test cases.

These changes ensure that the function should now produce the expected output in both test cases.
