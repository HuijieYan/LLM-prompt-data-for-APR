The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the command list when `value` is a dictionary. The current implementation is using double quotes around the key-value pair, which is not the correct format for spark-submit command.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pair and only use the format `prop=value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version removes the unnecessary double quotes from the key-value pairs and uses the correct format for spark-submit command.

After making this change, the function will correctly generate the command list for spark-submit, and the tests should pass with the corrected implementation.
