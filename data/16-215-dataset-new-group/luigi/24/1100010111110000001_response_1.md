There are two failing tests with similar error messages that both suggest that the _dict_arg function is returning the input key/value pairs in the form of a list of strings: ['"key=value"']. However, the expected output is a list of strings: ['key=value'].

The cause of the bug is the unnecessary double quotes around the key=value pairs. The _dict_arg function is adding unnecessary double quotes to the string, which then causes the tests to fail because the expected output in the test does not include these quotes.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the output list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed value to val to avoid overwriting the variable
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```

With the above correction, the _dict_arg function no longer includes unnecessary double quotes in the key=value pairs, and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
