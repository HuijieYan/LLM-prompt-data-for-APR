The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary values when creating the command list. It is not correctly adding the quotes around the key-value pair.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the dictionary values before adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the dictionary values and create the command list as expected. It should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
