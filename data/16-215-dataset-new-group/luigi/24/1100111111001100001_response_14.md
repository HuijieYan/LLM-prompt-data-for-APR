The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable used in the for loop with the loop iteration value. This causes the resulting command list to only contain the last key-value pair from the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, the loop iteration value should be stored in a different variable than `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Used val instead of value
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
