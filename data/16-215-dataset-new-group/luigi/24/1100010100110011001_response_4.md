The bug in the function is caused by the use of double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This leads to the inclusion of the double quotes in the final output, causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when constructing the command list. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed the double quotes around the value
    return command
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
