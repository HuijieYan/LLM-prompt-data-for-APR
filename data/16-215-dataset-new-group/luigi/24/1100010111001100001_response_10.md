The buggy function `_dict_arg` is trying to build a command list based on the input dictionary. However, there is a bug in the code that is causing the failing test. The bug occurs because the function is using the same variable `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable. This causes the loop variable to overwrite the input parameter `value`. 

To fix the bug, a different variable name should be used as the loop variable to avoid overwriting the input parameter value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'prop_value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'prop_value'
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly build the command list based on the input dictionary, and the failing test should pass.
