There are two potential issues in the _dict_arg function:
1. The value should be added as is, without surrounding quotes, when building the command list.
2. The property name and value should be separated by an equals sign without formatting them as a string.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding quotes around the property name and value and not correctly separating them with an equals sign, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output lists in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to remove the quotes around the property name and value, and use an equals sign to separate them.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now produce the expected output and pass the failing tests.
