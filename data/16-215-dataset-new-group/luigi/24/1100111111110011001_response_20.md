The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly handling the input dictionary `value` and appending its key-value pairs to the `command` list without properly formatting the strings. This causes a mismatch in the test cases, leading to assertion errors.

To fix the bug, the function should properly format the key-value pairs and append them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The key differences in the corrected version are:
1. Instead of wrapping the values in double quotes, it uses the `--key=value` format for appending to the command list.
2. It uses `val` and `prop` instead of reusing `value` and `prop` which caused variable shadowing.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
