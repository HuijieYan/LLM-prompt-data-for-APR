Bug Resolution:

The error is caused by the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. It incorrectly constructs the `command` list by adding the value and the property as separate elements, leading to an incorrect call to the `subprocess.Popen` in the test functions. The correct format should be `'name=prop'` instead of two separate elements.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should be modified to construct the `command` list in the correct format.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the failing test should pass.
