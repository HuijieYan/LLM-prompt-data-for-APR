The issue is due to the `_dict_arg` method in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The method is supposed to take a name and a value and return a specific command list based on the condition of the `value` parameter. However, there is a bug in the code as it surrounds the value with double quotes, resulting in incorrect comparisons and failing test cases. It seems like the bug is with the command list when constructing the command. The value should not be enclosed in double quotes.

To fix the bug, we can remove the double quotes from the command list, ensuring the values are not enclosed in quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # this is the corrected _dict_arg function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]  # Removed the double quotes from the value
        return command
```

With the corrected version, the double quotes have been removed from the `value` when constructing the command, resolving the issue.
