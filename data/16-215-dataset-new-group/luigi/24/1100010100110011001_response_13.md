The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a `name` and a `value` as input, and build a command list based on the value being a dictionary. The intention is to iterate over the dictionary and add items to the command list in a specific format.

The bug in the function is caused by the use of double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs, which results in an unexpected format of the command list when it is joined together.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without using double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should resolve the formatting issue and pass the failing tests.
