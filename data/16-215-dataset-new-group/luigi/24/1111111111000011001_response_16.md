The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name 'value' within the for loop. This is causing the loop to overwrite the original 'value' parameter, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, we can use a different variable name for the loop iteration, such as 'prop_value', to avoid overwriting the original 'value' parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary, without overwriting the original 'value' parameter.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
