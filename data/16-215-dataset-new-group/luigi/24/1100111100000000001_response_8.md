The main issue with the _dict_arg function is the re-use of the variable name "value" within the for loop, which overwrites the original value of "value" passed to the function. This can cause unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration. Also, we need to ensure that the "name" parameter is included in the command list for each item in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, I have used "key" and "val" as the loop iteration variables to avoid overwriting the original "value" parameter. I also included the "name" parameter in the command list for each item in the dictionary.
