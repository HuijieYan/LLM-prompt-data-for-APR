The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to generate a command from a given name and a dictionary of values. However, the bug lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the parameter `name` is added as a separate element in the `command` list, which is not intended. Instead, the name should be concatenated with the formatted string.

To fix this bug, we should concatenate `name` with the formatted string, and then add it to the `command` list. 

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} {prop}={val}")
    return command
```

With this correction, the `name` is concatenated with the property and its value, and then added to the `command` list. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works as intended. The corrected function should pass the failing test.
