The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary formatting of the dictionary values as strings using double quotes, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output. The `value` in the input dictionary should be directly appended to the `command` list without further formatting.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary formatting of the dictionary values as strings in the `command` list. Additionally, we can check if the input `value` is not empty while iterating through the dictionary keys.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This updated version directly appends the key-value pairs from the input dictionary to the `command` list without unnecessary formatting, which should address the issues in the failing tests.
