The bug in the `_dict_arg` method is caused by the incorrect formatting of the command list. The function is adding additional double quotes around the property and value when they are joined together, resulting in an incorrect command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes when joining the property and value, and then return the correct command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to val to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```
