The buggy function is a method called `_dict_arg` that takes in two parameters, `name` and `value`. It is expected to construct a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. The function checks if `value` is not empty and is an instance of a dictionary, and then iterates through the key-value pairs to construct the command list.

The potential error in the function is that the inner loop variable `value` is being overshadowed by the function parameter `value`, causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function should construct the command list using the correct format.

The cause of the bug is that the for loop variable `value` is overshadowing the function parameter `value`, leading to incorrect construction of the command list.

To fix the bug, the inner loop variable should be renamed to avoid overshadowing the function parameter. Additionally, the format for constructing the command list should be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the loop variable to val
            command += [name, '--conf', '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # correct the format
    return command
```
