```

1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module.
2. The potential error location in the buggy function is the use of the variable name `value` for both the input argument and the loop iterator, which can cause confusion and incorrect results.
3. The cause of the bug is that the loop iterator overwrites the input `value` parameter, leading to incorrect command building.
4. To fix the bug, the loop iterator variable name should be different from the input parameter name to avoid overwriting. In the corrected version, the variable name inside the loop is changed to `val` to prevent conflict and ensure correct command building.
5. The corrected version of the buggy function is provided above.
