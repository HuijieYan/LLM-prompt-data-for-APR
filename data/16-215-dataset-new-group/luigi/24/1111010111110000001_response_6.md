The function `_dict_arg` in the provided class `SparkSubmitTask` is not working correctly. It should take a dictionary as the `value` parameter and build a command list based on its items. The code given is failing to convert the properties and their values into the string representation required in the command list.

The failing test cases show differences in the constructed command list due to the incorrect handling of property-value pairs in the `_dict_arg` function. The assertion failures specifically mention discrepancies in properly formatting `"` and `=` characters around the property values that were incorrectly interpreted, causing the command list to differ from the expected value in the tests.

To fix the bug, instead of directly constructing the command list within the `for` loop, we need to generate arguments for the name and each key-value pair in the dictionary. Each argument should be a separate element in the command list, which replaces the original property-value string formed using `format()`.

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method is given below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            # Append the key as an argument element and value as a separate element in the command list
            command.append(name)
            command.append(prop)
            command.append(str(val))  # Convert value to string if needed
    return command
```

This corrected `_dict_arg` function addresses the issue by correctly handling property-value pairs and constructing the command list as expected by the test cases.
