The buggy function `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class is not iterating through the dictionary values correctly and appending them to the command list. This is causing the failing test cases to produce incorrect arguments to be passed to the `proc.call_args` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not handling the dictionary values properly, resulting in incorrect command construction when processing the dictionary items. This is leading to failure of the test cases provided.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to correct the iteration through the dictionary items and correctly construct the command to be returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Corrected variable assignment to val instead of value
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, the failing test cases should now pass as the correct command arguments will be generated, fixing the previous bug.
