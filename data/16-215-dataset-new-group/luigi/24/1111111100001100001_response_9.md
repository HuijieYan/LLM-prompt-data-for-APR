Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems like the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable within the loop, which causes incorrect behavior. 

To fix the bug, you can rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid the conflict with the input parameter `value`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable from `value` to `prop_value`, we avoid overwriting the input variable `value` and ensure that the correct properties and values are added to the `command` list.
