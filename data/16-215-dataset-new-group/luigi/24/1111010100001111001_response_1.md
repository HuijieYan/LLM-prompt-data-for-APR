The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs in the `command` list. This is not consistent with how command line arguments are typically formatted.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property-value pairs when appending them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the `command` list will contain the correctly formatted command line arguments. This will ensure that the function returns the expected output for the given input cases.
