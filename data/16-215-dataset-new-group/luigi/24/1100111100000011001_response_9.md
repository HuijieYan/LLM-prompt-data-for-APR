## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # change variable name from value to val
    return command
```

After analyzing the buggy function and the related function `name`, we can see that the issue lies in the reusing the name `value` for the loop variable in the `_dict_arg` function, which conflicts with the input parameter `value`. This causes unexpected behavior when building the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to change the variable name in the loop from `value` to a different name, for example, `val`, to avoid conflict with the input parameter `value`.

The corrected version of the function is provided above, with the variable name in the loop changed to `val` to avoid the conflict. This will ensure that the `command` list is built correctly based on the input `value`.
