The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and a dictionary of values as input and return a command as a list. The issue with the function is that it's not handling the values from the dictionary correctly, resulting in differences between the actual and expected command lists.

The problem arises from the construction of the command list inside the loop. The values should not be enclosed in double quotes and should be added without any modification.

To fix the bug, the function needs to construct the command list using the format `prop=value` for each item in the dictionary, and append it to the command list. Additionally, the logic should be restructured to handle the case when the value is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the test cases should pass as the expected input/output values will now be satisfied.
