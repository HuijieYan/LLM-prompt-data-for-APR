The bug in the _dict_arg function is due to the use of unnecessary double quotes around the property value when forming the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail because the expected and actual command lists do not match due to the difference in formatting.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the property value in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
