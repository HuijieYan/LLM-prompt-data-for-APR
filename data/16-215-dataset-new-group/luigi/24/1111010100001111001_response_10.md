The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is causing the dictionary key-value pairs to be incorrectly formatted in the `command` list. The bug can be fixed by removing the extra quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs in the `command` list, without unnecessary quotes.

This should satisfy the expected input/output values for both Case 1 and Case 2.
