The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property and value in the command list when building the command.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property and value in the command list when building the command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
