The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable in the for loop, which causes incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the variable name in the for loop from `value` to something else, so it doesn't overwrite the `value` parameter that is passed to the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the `command` list based on the input `value` dictionary.
