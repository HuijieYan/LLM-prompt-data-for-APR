The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary as input, iterate through it, and construct a list of command line arguments. However, the function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary items into strings and including unnecessary quotes around the values.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect formatting of the dictionary items using string interpolation with unnecessary quotes, leading to the mismatch between the expected and actual output values.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary quotes should be removed when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes in the command construction, the corrected function should now return the expected command list values for the given test cases.
