The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is appending the key-value pairs to the `command` list without enclosing them in quotes. This causes the command list to be incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to enclose the key-value pairs in quotes before appending them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now enclose the key-value pairs in quotes before appending them to the `command` list, satisfying the expected input/output values.
