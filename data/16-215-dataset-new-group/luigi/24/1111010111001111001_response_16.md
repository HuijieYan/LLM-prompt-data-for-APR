The issue with the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not correctly formatting the command list. It should be appending the name and value of each property in the dictionary as separate items in the command list, each enclosed in double quotes. However, the current function is concatenating the name and value with an equal sign and formatting it within a single double quote, resulting in an incorrect command list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the name-value pairs from the dictionary as separate items in the command list, each enclosed in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"' + prop + '=' + val + '"']
    return command
```

This corrected version should correctly format the command list to satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing tests provided.
