The `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is not parsing dictionary values and adding them to the list properly. This is causing the command list to contain unwanted quotes and double quotes.

The root cause of the bug lies in the way dictionary values are being concatenated into the `command` list. The string formatting used inside the function for each dictionary key-value pair involves adding double quotes. This is unnecessary, especially when these values are already expected to be strings.

A strategy to fix the bug is to remove the double quotes during the string formatting process and ensure that the resulting `command` list contains unquoted values for dictionary properties.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # Corrected the string formatting
    return command
```

By removing unnecessary quotes in the string formatting step, we ensure that the properties and values parsed from the dictionary are directly added to the command list without errors.
