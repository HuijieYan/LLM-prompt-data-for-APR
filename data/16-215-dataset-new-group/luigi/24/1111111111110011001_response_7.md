The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding quotes around the `prop=value` pairs when creating the `command` list. This is causing the test to fail as it expects the `prop=value` pairs without quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes from the `prop=value` pairs when constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename value to val to avoid name collision
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now pass both failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
