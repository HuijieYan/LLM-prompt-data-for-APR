The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary quotation marks around the value in the resulting `command` list. This is due to the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, which adds the value in quotation marks. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotation marks when appending the key-value pair to the `command` list. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotation marks, the corrected function will now correctly create the `command` list without unnecessary quotation marks around the key-value pairs, fixing the bug.
