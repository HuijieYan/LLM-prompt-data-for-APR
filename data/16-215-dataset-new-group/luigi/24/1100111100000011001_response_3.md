## Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the variable name in the for loop is being overwritten by the function parameter name. This causes the loop to use the same variable for two different purposes, resulting in incorrect output.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the variable name in the for loop to something different from the function parameter name.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
