The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it wraps the property and value in double quotes, resulting in a different output format than expected. The expected format for the output is to have the property and value separated by an equal sign without quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should not include double quotes when adding the property and value to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
