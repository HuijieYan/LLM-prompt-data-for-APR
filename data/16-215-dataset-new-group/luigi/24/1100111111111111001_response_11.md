The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not properly formatting the values from the input dictionary into a command list. It is adding unnecessary quotes around the value and the property when creating the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should format the command list without unnecessary quotes. This can be achieved by removing the quotes around `{0}={1}` when adding the property and value to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
