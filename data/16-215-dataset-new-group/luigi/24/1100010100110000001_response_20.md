The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to add items to a command list when a valid dict is found for a given key but this is not working as expected. The error message indicates that the `prop: value` pairs in parameters are not being treated correctly.

On analysis we can identify that the issue in the buggy function is due to the fact that `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` adds `"` around the prop-value pair in the command, which is incorrect. This is causing the test cases to fail as the constructed command and the expected command are not matching because of these extra characters.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to eliminate the `"` characters from the `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)` while constructing the command list. This will make sure that the command list constructed by the function matches the expected list and the test cases will pass.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
