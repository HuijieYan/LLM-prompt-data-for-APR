The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not handling the key-value pairs properly when building the command list. It should be using the name parameter as the key for the command list. 

In the given test cases, the function is failing to correctly build the command list when the input value is a dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to update the way the command list is constructed to include the name parameter as the key and the prop and value from the input dictionary as the value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly build the command list based on the input dictionary and pass the failing tests.
