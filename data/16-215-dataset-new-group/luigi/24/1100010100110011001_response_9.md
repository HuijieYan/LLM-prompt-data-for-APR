## Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value when constructing the `command` list. This is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list based on the input dictionary.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After making this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and return the expected command list without unnecessary double quotes.
