The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary into a list of command arguments. The function is not properly handling the quotes around the key-value pairs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs, which is resulting in an incorrectly formatted command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs and ensure that the command list is formatted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now generate the correct command list based on the input dictionary, and the expected output values will be satisfied.
