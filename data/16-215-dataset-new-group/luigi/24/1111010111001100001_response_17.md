The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the input dictionary properly. It is supposed to iterate over the dictionary and construct the command list accordingly, but it is not doing so correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not looping through each key-value pair in the input dictionary to construct the command list. Instead, it's only handling the first key-value pair.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the input dictionary and form the command list by adding each key-value pair to it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the input dictionary will be correctly iterated over and the command list will be constructed with all the key-value pairs. This should fix the bug and make the failing tests pass.
