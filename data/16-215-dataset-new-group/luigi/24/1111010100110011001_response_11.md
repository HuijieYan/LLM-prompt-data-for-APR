The issue with the provided function is that it is incorrectly handling the dictionary values for generating a command. The function currently wraps the dictionary values in double quotes, resulting in unexpected behavior when comparing the command with the expected values.

To fix the bug, the function should remove the double quotes around the values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the double quotes around the values in the command list, which aligns with the expected input/output values. With this fix, the function should produce the correct command list and pass the failing tests.
