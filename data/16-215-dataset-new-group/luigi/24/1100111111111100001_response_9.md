The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the fact that it is incorrectly adding the value of the dictionary as a string with quotes. This is causing the failing tests to compare the expected list of command arguments with the actual list of command arguments and find differences due to the added quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should add the dictionary values without quotes.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will generate the command list without adding extra quotes around the values in the dictionary. After applying this fix, the failing tests should pass.
