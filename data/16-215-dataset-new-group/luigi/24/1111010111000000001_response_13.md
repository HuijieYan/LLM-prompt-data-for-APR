1. The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the class `SparkSubmitTask` in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. It appears to be a method used to construct a command for running a Spark job or submitting a Spark application.

2. The potential error location in the `_dict_arg` function is the loop where the command is constructed from the input dictionary. Specifically, the issue could be related to how the items in the dictionary are being appended to the `command` list.

3. The cause of the bug appears to be related to the construction of the command list using the dictionary values. The failing tests indicate that the final constructed command list does not match the expected command list. This suggests that the `_dict_arg` function is not constructing the command properly.

4. To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to correctly construct the command by iterating through the input dictionary and appending the key-value pairs to the command list in the expected format. It seems that the current implementation is adding unnecessary quotes and formatting to the values before appending them to the command list.

5. Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)])  # Modified to construct the command list properly
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and uses the `extend` method to append the key-value pairs to the command list without unnecessary formatting or quotes. This should address the bug and ensure the function constructs the command list correctly.
