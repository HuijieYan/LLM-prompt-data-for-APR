The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the input `value` should be converted to a list of strings instead of a dictionary. The error originates from the `_dict_arg` function when it creates a command string. It fails to convert the dictionary to a list of strings.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to iterate through the dictionary passed in as `value`, generate the string in the format `prop=value` for each key-value pair, and append it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, value)]  # Adjusted the command generation
    return command
```
