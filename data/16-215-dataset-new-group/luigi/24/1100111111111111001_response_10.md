The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary items when creating the command list. The expected behavior is for the items to be formatted with double quotes around the property=value pairs.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly format the dictionary items with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Corrected formatting of dictionary items
    return command
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected output values.
