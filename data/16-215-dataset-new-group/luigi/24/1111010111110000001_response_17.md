From the given context, it appears `spark-submit` command is not getting the arguments passed due to formatting issues in `_dict_arg()` method. It results in failing the test cases with `AssertionError` during comparisons because the formatting of arguments is not recognized as expected in the output. The failing test cases provide the details of the failure in the form of a detailed comparison error message.

### Bug Identification
- The bug is identified in the `_dict_arg()` method of `SparkSubmitTask`, where the `value` parsing to append into `command` list is causing incorrect formatting.

### Potential Error Locations
- Incorrect handling or formatting of the dictionary in the `_dict_arg()` method could be the cause of the failing test cases.
- The mechanism to format and append dictionary arguments could also be a potential error location.

### Cause of the Bug
- The main cause of the bug is the wrong formatting of dictionary values that are being passed to the SparkSubmit environment.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Modify the `_dict_arg()` method to ensure that the dictionary values are being formatted and appended properly.
- Also, make sure the function correctly handles the parsing and formatting of dictionary values.

### Corrected Version
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
After correcting the code as above, the `_dict_arg()` method will handle the dictionary arguments properly and ensure correct formatting when fetching the dictionary values.

By making these modifications, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg()` method should resolve the formatting issues and allow the test cases to pass.
