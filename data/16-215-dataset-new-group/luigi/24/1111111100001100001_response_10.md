The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it does not correctly generate the command list when the input value is a dictionary. Instead of appending the dictionary key-value pairs to the command list, it incorrectly appends the name and a formatted string representing the key-value pair.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly formats the dictionary key-value pairs as a string and appends it to the command list, resulting in an incorrect command list.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the dictionary key-value pairs, format each pair as 'name=value', and append it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
