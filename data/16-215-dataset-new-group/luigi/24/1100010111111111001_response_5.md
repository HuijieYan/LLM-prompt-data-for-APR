The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into strings for the command list. It is adding unnecessary double quotes around the values.

To fix the bug, the function should remove the unnecessary double quotes and format the key-value pairs as strings without quotes around the values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name to val to avoid conflict with the outer value variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
