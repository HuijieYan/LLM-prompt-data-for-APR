The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is adding quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the `command` list, leading to a mismatch with the expected values. The function should not add quotes around the property-value pair.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to construct the `command` list without adding quotes around the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will construct the `command` list without adding quotes around the property-value pairs, and it will match the expected values from the failing tests.
