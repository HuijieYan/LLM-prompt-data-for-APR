The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is the unnecessary double-quoting of the property and value when adding them to the `command` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values with unnecessary quotes, leading to a mismatch when comparing the command list with the expected result.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double-quoting should be removed from the function when adding the property and value to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
