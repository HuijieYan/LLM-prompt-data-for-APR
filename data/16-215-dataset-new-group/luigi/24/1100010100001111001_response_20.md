Based on the runtime and expected values, it seems that the bug is caused by the incorrect formation of the command list. The function is not adding the quotation marks correctly around the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the string interpolation is done to ensure that each key-value pair is properly formatted within the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for the buggy function.
