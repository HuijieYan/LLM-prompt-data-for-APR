The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly formatting the values inside the dictionary when constructing the command list. The values should be enclosed in double quotes, but the function is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly enclose the values in double quotes when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, f'"{prop}={val}"'])
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will format the dictionary values correctly and enclose them in double quotes, which will match the expected values and pass the failing tests.
