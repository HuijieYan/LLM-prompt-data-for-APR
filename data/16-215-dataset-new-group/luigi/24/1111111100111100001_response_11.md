The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the additional quotes around the property value when creating the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command list, leading to the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the additional quotes around the property value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed and the failing tests should pass.
