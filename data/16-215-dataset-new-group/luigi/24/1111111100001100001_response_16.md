The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is overwriting the value variable which is used in the loop, causing incorrect results. The loop variable `value` is being used for two different purposes, once as the input to the function and then again as the value for the dictionary items. This causes the loop to iterate over the wrong values and results in incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we should change the variable name of the loop value in the for loop to something different from the input value, and use it to build the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable name here
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary and return the expected values.
