The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the variable `value` in the for loop, which causes incorrect behavior. When iterating through the `value.items()`, the `value` variable is used for both the outer loop and the inner loop, causing issues.

To fix the bug, a new variable should be used for the inner loop iteration, and the `+=` operator should be avoided when building the command list as it can cause unexpected behaviors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for inner loop
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))  # Avoid using += to build the list
    return command
```

With the above correction, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing tests.
