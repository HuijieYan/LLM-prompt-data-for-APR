## Analyzing the buggy function
The function `_dict_arg` is expected to take a name and a dictionary value, and convert them into a list of command arguments. However, there are potential errors in the way the function is handling the input dictionary and constructing the command list.

## Potential error locations
1. The use of the variable name `value` inside the loop may cause conflicts with the function parameter `value`.
2. The formatting of the command string may not be correct, leading to a malformed command list.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the reassignment of the variable `value` inside the loop, which results in incorrect command construction and possibly overwriting the original value.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, it's important to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid conflicts with the function parameter `value`. Additionally, the command string formatting should be revised to ensure the correct construction of command arguments.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Use different variable names
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, key, val))  # Correct command string formatting
    return command
```
