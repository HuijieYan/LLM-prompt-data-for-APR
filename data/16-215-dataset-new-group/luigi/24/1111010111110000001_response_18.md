The issue with the _dict_arg function stems from the way it processes the dictionary input. The current function implementation doesn't process the elements of the integer as they should be, leading to an assertion error in the test functions.

The problem mainly arises because the method simply converts the properties in the dictionary to a string that combines the property key and its value enclosed in double quotes. While this implementation might work for some cases, it leads to errors when there are elements in the dictionary that shouldn't have double quotes around them.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the values regardless of their type.

Here's an updated version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                if isinstance(value, str):
                    command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
                else:
                    command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]        
        return command
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that if the value is a string, it is concatenated with the name without double quotes. If the value is not a string, it is combined without double quotes.

The corrected version of the _dict_arg function should address the issue and enable the successful execution of the test functions.
