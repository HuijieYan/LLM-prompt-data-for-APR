The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding quotes around the value when constructing the command list, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the value is a string and if it is, then add it to the command list without quotes. If the value is not a string, then it should add it with the quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, f'"{val}"')]
    return command
```
