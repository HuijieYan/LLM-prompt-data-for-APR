The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it adds double quotes around the property value when constructing the command. This leads to mismatches when comparing the expected and actual values. To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes around the property value when constructing the command.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now return the command list in the expected format without any additional double quotes around the property values.

This corrected version should now pass both failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
