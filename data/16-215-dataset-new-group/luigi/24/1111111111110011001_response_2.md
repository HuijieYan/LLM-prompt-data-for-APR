The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property values. This is causing the failing tests to compare the expected command list with the actual command list, leading to assertion errors.

To fix this, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property values in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name to 'val' to avoid conflict with the 'value' parameter
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # remove the double quotes around prop and val
    return command
```

With this change, the updated function should pass the failing tests and return the expected values for all the given cases.
