The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not properly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. It is not adding double quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the dictionary values before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict with function parameter
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Properly formatting the key-value pair and adding to the command list
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the dictionary key-value pairs and add them to the command list.

This updated function should now produce the expected output values in both provided test cases.
