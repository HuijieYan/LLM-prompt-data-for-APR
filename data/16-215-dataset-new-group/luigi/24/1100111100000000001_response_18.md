## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes in a `name` and a `value` as input, and then checks if the `value` is a dictionary. If it is, it iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to a `command` list. However, there are a couple of potential issues in the function:

1. The variable `value` is used both as the input parameter and as the iteration variable in the loop, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs.
2. The formatting of the key-value pairs into a string is not done correctly.

## Identifying the Bug

The potential bug locations are:
- The reassignment of the `value` variable within the loop.
- The incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs into a string.

## Cause of the Bug

The cause of the bug is that the `value` variable is being overwritten within the loop, causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the formatting of the key-value pairs into a string is incorrect, leading to errors in the resulting `command` list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable for the iteration in the loop and correct the formatting of the key-value pairs into a string.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Use key and val instead of reusing value
            command.append(f'{name} "{key}={val}"')  # Correctly format the key-value pairs
    return command
```
