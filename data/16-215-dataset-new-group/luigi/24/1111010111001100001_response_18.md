The problem with the `_dict_arg` method is that it is not handling the dictionary key-value pairs correctly. When the method is called with a dictionary, it should construct a list where each element is a key-value pair in the format `"key=value"`.

The cause of the bug is that the method is incorrectly constructing the command list from the dictionary provided, resulting in an incorrect command list being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the dictionary and construct the command list properly by appending each key-value pair in the format `"key=value"` to the list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This version of the method should construct the command list correctly and pass the failing tests.
