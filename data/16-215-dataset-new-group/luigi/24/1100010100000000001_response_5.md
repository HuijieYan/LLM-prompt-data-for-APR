## Analysis of the buggy function:
The function is intended to build a command list using the name and value pairs from a dictionary. However, it has a few potential error locations:
1. The use of the variable name in the loop, which is also the name of the function parameter.
2. The use of double quotes around the {0}={1} format string, which may not be necessary.

## Potential causes of the bug:
1. The reassignment of the name variable in the loop may cause conflicts with the function parameter name.
2. The unnecessary use of double quotes around the format string may result in incorrectly formatted command elements.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different variable name in the loop to avoid conflicts with the function parameter name.
2. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the format string to format the command elements correctly.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, arg_name, arg_value):
    command = []
    if arg_value and isinstance(arg_value, dict):
        for prop, value in arg_value.items():
            command += [arg_name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
