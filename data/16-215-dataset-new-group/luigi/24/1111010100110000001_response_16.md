The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function of the `SparkSubmitTask` class resides within the generation of the command. It incorrectly uses double quotes around the property-value pair if the value is a dictionary. This is causing the error message, as seen in the failing test assertions. In both error messages, there is a discrepancy regarding the properties value - with the correct version not containing the additional quotes.

A potential fix for the bug would involve updating the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command when the value is a dictionary. In this case, the quotes around the key-value pair should be removed to ensure that the command line arguments are structured correctly, and this would resolve the errors seen in the error messages.

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # Use curly braces without double quotes
        return command
```
By using curly braces without double quotes and updating the `_dict_arg` function to follow this approach, the corrected code will structure the command line arguments correctly. This revised approach will result in the passing of the failing tests as it no longer utilizes additional quoting around the property-value pairs, which caused the error.
