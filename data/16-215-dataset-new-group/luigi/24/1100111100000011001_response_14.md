## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is expected to take a `name` and a `value` as input. If the `value` is a dictionary, it should iterate over the key-value pairs and construct a list of commands. However, there are several issues in the code:
1. The variable `value` is used as both the input parameter and the loop variable, which can lead to confusion and potential errors.
2. The use of `value` as the loop variable overwrites the initial value of `value`.
3. The formatting of the command is not correctly using the `name` parameter.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of variable names and overwriting the `value` input parameter with the loop variable. This leads to incorrect construction of the command list.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the `value` input parameter. Additionally, we need to correctly use the `name` parameter to construct the command.

## The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
