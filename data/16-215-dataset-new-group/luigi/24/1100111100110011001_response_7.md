The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the use of double quotes around the value in the `command` list when constructing the command. This is resulting in a mismatch with the expected values when comparing the command lists in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the value when constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the value in the `command` list, the function now constructs the command list correctly and should pass the failing test cases with the expected values.
