Issue:
- The function `_dict_arg` is not implementing correctly as it returns double-quotation marks around the property-value pair when appending to the command list. However, the call for this function requires the property-value pair without double-quotation marks.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Remove double-quotation marks from the formatted property-value pair before appending it to the command list.

Updated corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable 'value' to 'val'
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double-quotation marks
        return command
