The potential error in the _dict_arg function is that the variable name "value" is being re-assigned within the loop, overwriting the original value passed into the function. This can cause unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" variable. Additionally, we can simplify the code by using list comprehension to generate the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command += [f'{name} "{prop}={val}"' for prop, val in value.items()]
    return command
```
