The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary argument into a list of command arguments. The function is joining the name and value using `=` and surrounding the entire pair with double quotes, which is not the correct format for command-line arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]`. This change will correctly format the command arguments without unnecessary double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
