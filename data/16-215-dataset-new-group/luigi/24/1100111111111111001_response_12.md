The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding double quotes around the property values in the `command` list, which is not expected. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property values when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should pass both failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
