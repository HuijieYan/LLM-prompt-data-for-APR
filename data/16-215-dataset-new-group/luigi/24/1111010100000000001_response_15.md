Analysis:
The buggy function _dict_arg takes in a name and a value and should return a list of command arguments. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates through the key-value pairs to create the command arguments.

Potential error locations:
1. The variable name "value" is used for both the input value and the loop variable in the for loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The formatting of the command arguments using '"{0}={1}"' could be improved.

Cause of the bug:
The use of the same variable name "value" for both the input value and the loop variable in the for loop overwrites the original value, resulting in incorrect command arguments. Additionally, the formatting of command arguments using '"' is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect syntax in the command.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the loop variable from "value" to something more descriptive, such as "item".
2. Update the formatting of the command arguments to use "{}={} without unnecessary quotes.

Corrected version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
In the above corrected version:
- The loop variable "value" has been renamed to "val" to avoid overwriting the original value.
- The formatting of the command arguments uses "{}={}" without unnecessary quotes, providing the correct syntax for command arguments.
- The corrected version addresses the potential errors and improves the readability and correctness of the function.
