The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict)` and the iteration over the dictionary `value.items()`. The cause of the bug could be that the function is not correctly building the command list from the dictionary input, which may result in incorrect command being generated.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly iterate over the dictionary and build the command list with the correct format. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we modified the iteration variable inside the loop to `val` to avoid shadowing the `value` parameter. We also changed the format of the command to use `--` and `=` for the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
