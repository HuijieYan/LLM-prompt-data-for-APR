The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into a command list. It is adding double quotes to the entire key-value pair instead of just the value, resulting in a discrepancy between the expected and actual values of the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _dict_arg function to format the key-value pairs correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs and generate the expected command list, satisfying the input/output values for the failing tests.
