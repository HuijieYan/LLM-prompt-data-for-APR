## Analysis
The function is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input, then iterate through the dictionary and construct a list of strings in the format "name='value'". However, the function seems to have a bug in constructing the command list.

## Potential error locations
The error seems to be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. It looks like the code is not formatting the strings correctly before adding them to the `command` list.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of string formatting in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This results in the incorrect construction of the `command` list.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the strings before adding them to the `command` list.

## Corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val
            command += [f'{name}={val}']  # using f-string for string formatting
    return command
```
