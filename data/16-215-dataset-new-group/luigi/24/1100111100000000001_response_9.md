## Analysis:
The function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a name and a dictionary as arguments, and then construct a list of command strings using the name and the key-value pairs from the dictionary. However, there are potential issues in this function that need to be addressed.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Reusing the variable `value` within the loop, which may cause unexpected behavior.
2. Incorrectly constructing the command string with double quotes.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from reusing the variable `value` within the loop, which overwrites the original value passed to the function. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect command construction. Additionally, the construction of the command string using double quotes is incorrect and may cause issues when using the command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid reusing the variable `value` within the loop and construct the command string correctly using the key-value pairs from the dictionary.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, input_dict):
    command = []
    if input_dict and isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        for prop, val in input_dict.items():
            command.append(f"{name}='{prop}={val}'")
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
1. Changed the variable name from `value` to `val` within the loop to avoid confusion.
2. Constructed the command string using single quotes and the correct format for key-value pairs.
