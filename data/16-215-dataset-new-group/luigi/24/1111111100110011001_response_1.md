    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from value to val to avoid confusion
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the inner quotes around {1}
        return command
```

### Explanation
1. The current buggy function iterates over the key-value pairs of the input `value` and constructs a command list, adding the `name`, `prop`, and `val` in a specific format.
2. However, there are issues with the construction of the command list, as it is adding inner quotes around the `{1}` placeholder for value, which is causing discrepancies in the expected vs. actual lists during the tests.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Adjust the variable name inside the loop to make it easier to understand and avoid confusion with the input parameter `value`.
2. Remove the inner quotes around the `{1}` placeholder in the command construction.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from value to val to avoid confusion
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed the inner quotes around {1}
    return command
```
