Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # change value variable to val to avoid shadowing
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove quotes around {0}={1}
        return command
```

Explanation for the bug and the fix:

The bug in the original function was due to incorrectly constructing the command list. The function was adding double quotes around each property-value pair, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs and changes the variable name inside the loop to avoid shadowing the input parameter `value`.

With this correction, the function should now properly construct the command list and pass the failing test cases.
