The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not properly formatting the command list when iterating over the dictionary. It should be adding the values with an equals sign instead of using `format`.

The bug is causing the failing tests because the command list is not being populated correctly, resulting in the wrong arguments being passed to the process call.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the command list when iterating over the dictionary. This can be done by appending the name and value with an equals sign directly to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```
With this correction, the function should now properly create the command list and pass the correct arguments to the process call, causing the failing tests to pass.
