The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly adds quotation marks around the property and value when building the command list, resulting in the failing tests due to the unexpected format of the command list.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is adding unnecessary quotation marks to the property and value when building the command list. This causes the format of the command list to be different from what is expected in the test, leading to the failing assertions.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary quotation marks when building the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly build the command list without unnecessary quotation marks, and the failing tests should pass.
