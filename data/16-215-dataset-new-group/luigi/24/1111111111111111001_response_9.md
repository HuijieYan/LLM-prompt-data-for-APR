The buggy function _dict_arg() fails to construct the command list correctly when the input value is a dictionary. It should format the dictionary key-value pairs as strings and add them to the command list. However, it fails to format the strings correctly, leading to a mismatch with the expected values.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the formatting of dictionary key-value pairs when adding them to the command list. It fails to properly format the strings, leading to a mismatch with the expected values.

To fix the bug, the function should properly format the key-value pairs as strings and add them to the command list. This can be achieved by using string formatting and appending the formatted strings to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list and pass the failing tests.
