The bug in the _dict_arg function is that when creating the command list, it mistakenly surrounds the property-value pair with double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected values. The function incorrectly appends double quotes to the property-value pairs.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes from the property-value pairs when adding them to the command list in the _dict_arg function.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly constructs the command list without appending unnecessary double quotes to the property-value pairs. This should resolve the mismatch with the expected values and pass the failing tests.
