The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly building the command list when the input value is a dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that the function is overwriting the `value` variable in the for loop, leading to incorrect values being added to the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we need to change the variable name in the for loop that iterates over the dictionary items.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name here to avoid overwriting the outer 'value' variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Update to use the new variable 'val'
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should correctly build the `command` list with the key-value pairs from the input dictionary, and the failing tests should pass.
