## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class, test code:

The buggy function is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class, which is meant to be a template task for running a Spark job. The `_dict_arg` function is used to convert a dictionary of arguments to a list, where each key-value pair from the dictionary is converted to a string and added to the list.

The failing test cases are from the `contrib/spark_test.py` file, which is testing the functionality of the `SparkSubmitTask` class and its related methods.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function could be related to the way it's constructing the command list from the dictionary input. Specifically, the loop that iterates over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary could be causing the bug.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the failing test:

The _dict_arg function is currently generating invalid commands due to the incorrect handling of the dictionary input. This is causing the failing test cases that expect the function to construct a valid command list for a Spark job.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by correcting the way the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are converted to strings and added to the command list. It's important to ensure that the generated command is correctly formatted and includes the necessary elements.

## The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)])  # Use extend instead of +=
    return command
```

The corrected version of the function uses `extend` to add the key-value pairs to the command list, and also correctly formats the key-value pairs using the `format` method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
