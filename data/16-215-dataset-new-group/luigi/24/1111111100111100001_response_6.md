### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the use of double quotes around the property-value pair when adding it to the `command` list. This causes the test cases to fail because the expected command list does not include the double quotes.

### Bug Fix

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when adding the property-value pair to the `command` list.

### The corrected version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
