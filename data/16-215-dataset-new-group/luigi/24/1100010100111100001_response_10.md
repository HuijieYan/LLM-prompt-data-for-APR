The problem with the buggy function is that when the value of the input parameter `value` is a dictionary, it doesn't correctly format the key-value pairs into the `command` list. Instead of appending the key-value pairs directly to the list, it is adding unnecessary quotes around the value when constructing the command.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the `command` list, without adding unnecessary quotes. This should address the issues observed in the failing tests.
