The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name `value` inside the for loop to iterate over the dictionary items, which overwrites the original value parameter. This causes the function to only process the last key-value pair of the input dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the iterator in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original value parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and construct the command list as expected.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and types for all the test cases provided.
