The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises when creating items in the `command` list. The current implementation incorrectly constructs the command list, which results in a mismatch. The correct elements of the list is NOT wrapped in double quotes in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that when value is a dictionary, the function should extract the key-value pairs from the dictionary and construct the command list using the extracted pairs. The current implementation does this, however the keys and values are incorrectly formatted - leading to a mismatch in the test due to incorrect elements in the list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the value and format the list elements with string concatenation instead of formatting.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
