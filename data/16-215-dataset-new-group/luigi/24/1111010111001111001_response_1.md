The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it doesn't properly format the dictionary key-value pairs as part of the command list. It is missing the quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly format the dictionary key-value pairs with quotes and append them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the dictionary key-value pairs and append them to the command list. This will ensure that the function passes the failing tests and produces the expected command list.
