The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the reusing of the variable name within the for loop. This causes the function to overwrite the input `name` with the keys from the dictionary, resulting in an incorrect `command` list.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name within the for loop to iterate through the dictionary items.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid overwriting the input name
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases.
