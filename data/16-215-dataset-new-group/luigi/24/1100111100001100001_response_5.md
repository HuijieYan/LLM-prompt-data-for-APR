The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the loop that constructs the `command` list. The bug is caused by reusing the variable name `value` in the loop, which overwrites the input parameter `value` and causes unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, I changed the loop variable name from `value` to `prop_value` to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`. This change ensures that the function works as intended and constructs the `command` list correctly based on the input dictionary `value`.
