The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary elements into a string. The bug is caused by the use of double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is unnecessary and causes issues with how the command is constructed.

To fix the bug, you should remove the double quotes from around the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list.

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # The corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from 'value' to 'val'
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove the unnecessary double quotes
        return command
```

This corrected function will properly construct the `command` list by formatting the dictionary elements without unnecessary double quotes. This will ensure that the command is correctly formed and can be used as intended.
