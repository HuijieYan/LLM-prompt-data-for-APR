The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is creating the command list incorrectly when processing the dictionary input. It should be iterating through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and adding the formatted string to the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly processing the dictionary input, resulting in an incorrect command list.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the items in the input dictionary and construct the command list accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version properly iterates through the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and generates the command list as expected.
