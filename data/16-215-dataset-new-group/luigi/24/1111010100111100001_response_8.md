The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding unnecessary double quotes around the property and value pairs when constructing the command list. This is resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value pairs need to be removed when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes in the `"{0}={1}"` format string, we ensure that the property and value pairs are correctly formatted in the command list.

This should resolve the issue and make the failing tests pass.
