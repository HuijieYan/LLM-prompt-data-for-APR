The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is not handling the values in the `dict` properly. It is not adding the key-value pairs correctly to the `command` list. Instead of adding the values directly, it is adding them as strings with additional quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly add the key-value pairs to the `command` list without additional quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should handle the key-value pairs correctly and pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
