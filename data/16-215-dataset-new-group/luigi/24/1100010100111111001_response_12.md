The issue in the buggy function is that it adds double quotation marks around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This causes the resulting command list to have incorrect formatting, leading to the failing tests.

The cause of the bug can be traced back to the _dict_arg function, where the property-value pairs are being formatted with double quotation marks unnecessarily, leading to the mismatch with the expected input/output values.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotation marks and format the property-value pairs as plain strings.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming 'value' to 'val' to prevent conflict with input parameter
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will format the property-value pairs without extra quotation marks, matching the expected input/output values and passing the failing tests.
