The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not constructing the command list correctly when value is a dictionary. Instead of adding the key-value pairs as separate items in the command list, it is adding them as a single string. This results in incorrect command construction and causes the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the dictionary items and add each key-value pair as separate items in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
