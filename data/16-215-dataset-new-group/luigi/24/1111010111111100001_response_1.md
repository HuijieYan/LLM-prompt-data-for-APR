The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This causes the test cases to fail because the expected and actual command lists do not match due to the unnecessary quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes from around the property value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed quotes from around the property value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, and the failing test cases should pass.
