## The corrected version of the function

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items(): # Changed the variable name from value to val to avoid conflict with the function parameter name
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)] # Removed the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value
        return command
```

Explanation:
The function `_dict_arg` is intended to create a command list based on the input dictionary `value`. The bug in the original function was caused by using the same variable name `value` in the for loop for both the outer and inner scope. This caused a conflict and led to unexpected behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the variable name in the for loop to avoid conflict with the function parameter name.
2. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value in the command list concatenation.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues and should work as intended.
