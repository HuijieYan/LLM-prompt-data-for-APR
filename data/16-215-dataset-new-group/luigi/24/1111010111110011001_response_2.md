The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the use of unnecessary double quotes in the `command` list when formatting the key-value pairs. This causes the test cases to fail because of a mismatch in the formatting of the key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, the double quotes should be removed from the key-value pairs added to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes and using the `format` method directly without enclosed quotes, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

This corrected function will pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values for both test cases.
