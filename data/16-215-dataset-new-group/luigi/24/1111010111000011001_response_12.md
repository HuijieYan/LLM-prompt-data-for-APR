The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by using the same variable name `value` for both the function parameter and the loop variable. This causes the loop variable to overwrite the function parameter, resulting in unexpected behavior. Additionally, the loop is incorrectly adding quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable. We also need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
