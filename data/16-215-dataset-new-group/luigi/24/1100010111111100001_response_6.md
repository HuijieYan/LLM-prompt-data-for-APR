The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is creating the command list with unnecessary quotation marks in the key-value pairs. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected and actual command values do not match.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks from the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the unnecessary quotation marks
    return command
```

After making this change, the function should return the command list without the unnecessary quotation marks. This will ensure that the test cases pass and the function works as expected.
