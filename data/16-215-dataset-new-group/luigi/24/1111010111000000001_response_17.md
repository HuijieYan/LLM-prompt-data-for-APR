The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary and convert it into a list of command line arguments. The function appears to iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary and appends it to the `command` list in the form of `name="value"`. However, the bug lies in the formatting of the command. The function incorrectly wraps the `prop=value` pairs with quotes, which is not the expected format for command line arguments.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect formatting of the command in the `_dict_arg` function. The failing tests indicate that the command line arguments are not formatted correctly when the function is used, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command using the key-value pairs as `--name value` without wrapping each pair with quotes. Additionally, it should take care of omitting `None` values from the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            if value is not None:  # Omit None values
                command += [f'--{name}', f'{prop}={value}']  # Format the command correctly
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function, it should now be able to correctly construct the command line arguments. When the tests are run again, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
