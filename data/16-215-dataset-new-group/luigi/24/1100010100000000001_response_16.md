## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes around prop=value
    return command
```

## Analysis and explanation
The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command line arguments. However, there are two potential errors in the original function:
1. In the original function, the inner loop variable `value` is being used, which overwrites the outer variable `value`. This can cause unexpected behavior and potential bugs.
2. The original function adds unnecessary double quotes around each `prop=value` pair in the command list, which may not be desired in all cases.

The cause of the bug is the overwriting of the `value` variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change the inner loop variable in the for loop from `value` to something else, to avoid overwriting the outer variable.
2. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around each `prop=value` pair in the command list.

## Corrected version
The corrected version of the function is provided above. It addresses the potential errors and removes the unnecessary double quotes, resulting in a more reliable and functional function.
