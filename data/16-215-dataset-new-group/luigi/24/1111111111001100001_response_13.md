The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to create a command list based on the input name and value pairs. However, it incorrectly concatenates the name and value using double quotes, which should not be there.

The cause of the bug is that the function is using double quotes in the command list, which is unnecessary and causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' for clarity
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes. This should make the failing tests pass.
