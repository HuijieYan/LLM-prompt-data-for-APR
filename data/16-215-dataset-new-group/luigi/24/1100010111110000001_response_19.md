The provided `_dict_arg` function takes in three parameters: `self`, `name`, and `value`, and returns a concatenated list of words given a set of input. There is a bug in the function that it adds double-quotes to the dictionary values which is not needed, as observed in the error message.

The error is coming from comparing the actual and expected command lists. It appears that the value of `Prop=Value` is double-quoted while it shouldn't be in the returned command list. The function `_dict_arg` adds double quotes to the dictionary values and wraps them with single quotes, which results in the lists to differ during comparison.

To fix this issue, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to only wrap dictionary values with single quotes, but not double quotes. The `format` method should be replaced with parametrized formatting to ensure accurate generation of command elements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "'{0}={1}'".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

The updated function only puts single quotes around the key-value pairs and correctly formats the command elements based on the input dictionary. After making this change, the function should no longer add double quotes, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
