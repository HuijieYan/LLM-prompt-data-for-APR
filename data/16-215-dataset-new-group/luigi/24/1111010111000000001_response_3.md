Analysis:
The buggy function _dict_arg is intended to process a dictionary and construct a command based on its entries. The issue is that the variable name in the for loop (prop) conflicts with the input argument name, causing a potential bug.


Identified potential error:
The potential error is within the for loop inside the _dict_arg function. The variable name in the for loop (prop) conflicts with the input argument name.

Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the command list to contain incorrect values due to the conflict between the variable in the for loop and the input argument name. This results in failing test cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, it is required to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid conflicts with the input argument. Additionally, it's essential to correctly construct the command list based on the dictionary values.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(k, v)]
    return command
```
