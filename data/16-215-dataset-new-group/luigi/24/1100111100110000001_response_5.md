In the buggy function `_dict_arg()`, the issue is that it concatenates both the `name` and `value` using double quotes, whereas it should only use quotes around the `value`. This is causing the test to fail since the list of args is getting different elements, leading to the AssertionError.

The cause of the bug is that when adding the `name` and `value` to the `command`, quotes are incorrectly placed around both `prop` and `value`. When the command args are created, the quotes should only be around the `value`.

To fix the bug, the `command` should be built with `name` and `value` formatted correctly. Additionally, renaming the inner `value` variable in the function to something else, so that it doesn't collide with the parameter name being passed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename value to val
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Putting quotes around val
    return command
```

This should resolve the error and make the function return the correct command.
