The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of arguments. The buggy function is adding quotes around the key-value pairs, but it should be adding them as a single string without quotes.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly formats the dictionary key-value pairs by adding unnecessary quotes around each key-value pair.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of arguments without unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, we ensure that the dictionary key-value pairs are formatted correctly when building the list of arguments.

This should resolve the issues with the failing tests and produce the expected output values.
