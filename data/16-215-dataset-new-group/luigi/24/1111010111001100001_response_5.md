The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is not constructing the command list properly when the input value is a dictionary. Instead of using the name parameter for each key-value pair, it is using the name parameter for the whole dictionary.

To fix this bug, the strategy is to iterate through the dictionary and construct the command list with the appropriate name for each key-value pair.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass.
