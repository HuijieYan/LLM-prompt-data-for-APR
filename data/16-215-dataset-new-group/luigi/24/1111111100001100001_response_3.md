The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is modifying the `command` list during the iteration through the dictionary items, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the same variable name `value` is being used for both the input value and the loop variable in the for loop. This causes the input value to be overwritten and results in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the loop variable in the for loop should be given a different name than the input parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
