The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values. It is adding double quotes around the property and value, which is causing the test cases to fail as they are expecting the values without double quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the test cases should now pass as the command list will be formatted correctly without unnecessary double quotes.

I have removed the unnecessary double quotes from around the property and value in the command list, so now the output will match the expected values in the test cases.
