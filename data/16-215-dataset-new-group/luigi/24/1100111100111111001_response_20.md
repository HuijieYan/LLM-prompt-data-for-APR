The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the fact that it is adding quotation marks around the value of the dictionary key-value pair when creating the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks when constructing the command list. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
