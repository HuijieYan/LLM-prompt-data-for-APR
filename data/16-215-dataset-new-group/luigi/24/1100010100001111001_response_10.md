The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly formatting the command list when value is a dictionary. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
This line adds the key-value pair to the command list with double quotes around it, which is not the expected format.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the key-value pairs in the command list and concatenate the key and value with an equals sign in between.

### Corrected function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The corrected function will now correctly format the command list by concatenating the key and value pairs with an equals sign in between, without any extra quotes. This will satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases.
