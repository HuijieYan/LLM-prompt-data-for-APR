The issue in the _dict_arg function is that it incorrectly places quotes around the property key and value when creating the command list. This causes the resulting command list to include additional quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotes around the property key and value when adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass both of the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
