The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is causing the values in the command list to be enclosed in double quotes, as seen in the failing test messages. The function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the value when building the command list.

The buggy function also overwrites the `value` variable used in the loop, which leads to incorrect values being added to the `command` list.

To fix the bug, the function should not enclose the values in double quotes and use a different variable name than `value` inside the loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly build the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes, and it should pass the failing tests.
