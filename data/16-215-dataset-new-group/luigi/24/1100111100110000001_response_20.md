The problematic function is _dict_arg(self, name, value), located in the luigi/contrib/spark.py file. The purpose of this function is to construct a command and prepare it for execution.
The two failing tests indicate that there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual format of the command being constructed.

An analysis of the code reveals that the issue is that when constructing the 'command' list, it includes the property-value pairs enclosed in double-quotes. The expectation is to have the pairs unquoted.
To address the cause of the problem, we need to modify the _dict_arg function to avoid including the double-quotes when appending property-value pairs to the 'command' list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

By replacing the '+=' operator with 'append()' when adding to the command, this corrected version should fix the bug and align with the expected command format. This version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
