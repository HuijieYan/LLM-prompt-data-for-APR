The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding additional quotes around the property-value pair when creating the `command` list. This causes the assertion errors in the tests because the expected and actual lists do not match due to these extra quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the additional quotes and format the property-value pair correctly when adding it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use val to avoid variable name conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # format the property-value pair correctly
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. If there are other tests or use cases, they should also be checked to ensure the correctness of the fix.
