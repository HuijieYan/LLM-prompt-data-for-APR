The `_dict_arg` function is creating a command out of a dictionary by iterating through the dictionary items and adding each to a list. The problem is, however, that it wraps each item into double quotes when inserting into the list. This results in incorrect elements due to mismatched quotes when the list is compared with expected values.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to remove the quotes around each item when appending them to the list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # Removed double quotes around each item
        return command
```
