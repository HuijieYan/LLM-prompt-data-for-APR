The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is overwriting the 'value' variable used in the for loop with the iteration variable 'value'. This causes the function to only consider the last key-value pair in the input dictionary and produce incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the iteration variable should be named differently from the 'value' variable used in the function input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items(): # changed from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)] # changed from 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly process all key-value pairs in the input dictionary and produce the expected output.
