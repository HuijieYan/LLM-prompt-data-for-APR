The bug in the `_dict_arg` function causes the conversion of dictionary values to include double quotes, which leads to a mismatch in the lists when compared. The buggy function adds double quotes around the property value before adding it to the command list, causing the unexpected behavior in the comparison.

To fix this bug, the double quotes should not be added to the property value in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
