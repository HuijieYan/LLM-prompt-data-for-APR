The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly adds the dictionary key-value pairs to the command list. The value is enclosed in double quotes, which causes the test to fail because the expected output does not include double quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the values when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now generate the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes, which will match the expected output of the failing tests.
