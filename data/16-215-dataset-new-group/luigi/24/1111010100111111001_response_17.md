The cause of the bug is that the current code is adding double quotes around the property and value in the command list, which is not expected. The expected behavior is to add the property and value in the format "prop=value" without any quotes. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the _dict_arg function to remove the quotes around the property and value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly format the properties and values without adding unnecessary quotes. This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
