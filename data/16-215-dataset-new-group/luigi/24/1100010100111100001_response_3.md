The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the values when creating the `command` list. The function is intended to construct a command list for a subprocess call, but it is erroneously adding double quotes around the property-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes when formatting the property-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict with outer scope
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove double quotes from the format
    return command
```

With the corrected version, the tests should pass without any AssertionError.
