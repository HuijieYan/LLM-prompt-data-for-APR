The cause of the bug is that the function mistakenly adds double quotes around the property and value when creating the command list. This causes the failing test to expect different values than the buggy function is returning.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes from around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
