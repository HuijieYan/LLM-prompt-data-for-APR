The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the value is being enclosed in double quotes, which is not needed.

To fix the bug, we can remove the double quotes from around the `prop=value` pairs in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
