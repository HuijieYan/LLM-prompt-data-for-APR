The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using `value` as both the input to the function and the iteration variable in the loop, which causes the original `value` input to be overwritten.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the iteration variable in the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
