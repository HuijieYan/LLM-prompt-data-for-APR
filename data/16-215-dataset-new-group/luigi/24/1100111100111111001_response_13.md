The issue in the buggy function is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary values when constructing the command list. Instead of just using the values from the dictionary, it encloses the values in double quotes which causes the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the values when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name to avoid conflict with the outer variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this correction, the function would correctly construct the command list without enclosing the values in double quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
