The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten by the outer loop variable `value`. This is causing the incorrect behavior in the function.

To fix this, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop value. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed variable name from value to val
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now pass both failing tests and return the expected values for the given test cases.
