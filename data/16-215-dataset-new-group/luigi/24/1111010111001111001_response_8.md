The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not correctly formatting the command list when the value parameter is a dictionary. It should be adding the dictionary key-value pairs to the command list in the format "prop=value".

The current function is adding the dictionary key-value pairs in the format "{prop}={value}". This results in the test cases failing because the expected command list is not matching the actual command list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly format the key-value pairs before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # The corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected function, the test cases should now pass as the command list will be formatted correctly for both input cases.
