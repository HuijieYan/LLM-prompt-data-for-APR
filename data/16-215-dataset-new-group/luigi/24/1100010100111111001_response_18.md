The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property-value pairs in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra quotes in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should return the correct command list without adding unnecessary quotes, and successfully pass the failing test cases.
