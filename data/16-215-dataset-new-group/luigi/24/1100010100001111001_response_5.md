The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't properly format the key-value pairs of the input dictionary when constructing the command list. Instead of formatting each key-value pair as a single string, it separates the key and value with an equals sign and puts them in separate strings in the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to format each key-value pair as a single string and then add it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected function will properly format each key-value pair from the input dictionary and append it to the command list, satisfying the expected input/output values.
