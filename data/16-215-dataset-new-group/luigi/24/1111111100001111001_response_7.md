The issue with the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is that it does not correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list.

The bug occurs because the function is using the same variable name `value` in the for loop, which overrides the original `value` parameter. This causes the function to incorrectly generate the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable in the for loop to something different from `value` to avoid overriding the original `value` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly generate the command list as expected.
