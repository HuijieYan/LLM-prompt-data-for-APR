1. The `setup_run_process(proc)` function is being called to create a mock process.
2. The `_dict_arg` function with arguments "conf" and "prop1=val1" is causing the issue.
3. The error messages show that the main issue is with how _dict_arg handles the "conf" and "prop1=val1" arguments. Specifically, it adds double quotes around "prop1=val1" when assembling the command, which is causing the test to fail since the test expects no quotes around the value.
4. To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function needs to be modified to handle the "conf" parameters without adding double quotes around the value.
5. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            if isinstance(prop_value, str):
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
