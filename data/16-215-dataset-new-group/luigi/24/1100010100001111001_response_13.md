The bug in the given function is that it is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary and adding them to the command list. It is also using the same variable name 'value' for the input dictionary and the individual value in the for loop, which leads to conflicts.

To fix this bug, we need to change the variable name used in the for loop to avoid conflicts and format the key-value pairs correctly before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, key, val))
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the expected input/output values for both cases are satisfied.
