The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the unnecessary quoting of the property value when creating the command list. This causes the test cases to fail because the function is not producing the expected output. To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quoting of the property value when generating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes around the property value in the command list, the function will generate the correct output. This corrected version of the _dict_arg function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
