The buggy function _dict_arg in the SparkSubmitTask class seems to be intended to construct a list of command line arguments from a dictionary. However, there are potential error locations within this function:

1. The variable name "value" is being reused for both the input value and the values within the dictionary, which can cause confusion and potential errors.
2. Enclosing the dictionary key-value pair in double quotes might cause issues when constructing the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not constructing the command properly from the input dictionary, and it may introduce unnecessary double quotes in the resulting command.

To fix the bug, we can revise the function to correctly construct the command from the input dictionary keys and values. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
1. The variable "value" is not reused for the values within the dictionary to avoid confusion.
2. The command is constructed using string formatting without unnecessary double quotes.

This should address the bug and correctly construct the command from the input dictionary.
