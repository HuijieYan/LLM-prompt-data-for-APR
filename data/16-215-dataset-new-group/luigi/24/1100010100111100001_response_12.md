The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the property=value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in the AssertionError when comparing the actual command list to the expected one in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes in the command list, the function should now return the correct command list, and the failing tests should pass.
