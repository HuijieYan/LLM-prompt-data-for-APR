The issue in the buggy function is that when constructing the `command` list, the values are being wrapped in double quotes even when they are not required. This is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function incorrectly formats the command list with unnecessary double quotes around the property values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to check if the value is a string and if it is, not to wrap it in double quotes. If the value is not a string, then we should proceed to wrap it in double quotes as before.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            if isinstance(prop_value, str):
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
