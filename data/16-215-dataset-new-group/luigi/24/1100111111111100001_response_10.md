The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that it incorrectly adds quotes around the property value pairs when constructing the `command` list. This causes the failing test to detect differences in the format of the command list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary quoting of the property value pairs when constructing the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to avoid overwriting the function argument
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Removed the unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the failing tests should pass.
