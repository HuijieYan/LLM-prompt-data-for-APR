The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not correctly constructing the command for the SparkSubmitTask. The bug is caused by overwriting the `value` variable in the for loop, which leads to incorrect values being added to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration in the for loop. We should also remove the unnecessary double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the command generation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop iteration
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With these changes, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly construct the command for the SparkSubmitTask.
