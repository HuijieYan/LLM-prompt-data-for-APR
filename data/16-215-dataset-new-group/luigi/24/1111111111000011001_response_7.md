The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable by reusing it in the for loop. This causes the function to lose track of the original `value` that is passed in.

To fix this issue, we can rename the loop variable in the for loop to something different from `value` to prevent overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the original `value` parameter is not overwritten in the for loop and retains its value when constructing the `command` list.

This should pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
