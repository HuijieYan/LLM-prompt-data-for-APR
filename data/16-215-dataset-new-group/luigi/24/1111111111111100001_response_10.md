The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly quotes the property value pair when adding it to the `command` list. This causes a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the failing tests. The function is adding quotation marks around the property value pair, which is unnecessary.

To fix the bug, the function should append the `name` and the property value pair directly to the `command` list without adding extra quotation marks.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `'_dict_arg'` function should now correctly generate the command list and pass the failing tests.
