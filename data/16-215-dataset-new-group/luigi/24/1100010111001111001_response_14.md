The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is not properly formatting the command output when value is a dictionary. The function needs to format the command by adding quotes around the dictionary key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _dict_arg function to properly format the command output for dictionary values. We can achieve this by using f-strings to format the key-value pairs with quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the command output and pass the failing tests.
