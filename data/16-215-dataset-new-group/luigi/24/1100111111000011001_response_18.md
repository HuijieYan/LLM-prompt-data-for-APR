The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it reuses the variable name 'value' inside the for loop, which overwrites the value parameter passed to the function. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

To fix this, we need to rename the variable used in the for loop to avoid the conflict with the input parameter 'value'.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Rename the variable to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

This should address the issue and ensure that the function correctly generates the command list based on the input dictionary, passing the provided test cases.
