## Analysis:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to create a list of command-line arguments for a Spark job based on a dictionary of key-value pairs. However, there are potential errors in the function. One potential error is that the variable `value` is being used for both the input dictionary and the individual values within the dictionary, which can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior. Another potential error is the use of double quotes around the key-value pairs, which may not be necessary and could cause issues when constructing the command.

## Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is not properly constructing the command based on the input dictionary. The use of the same variable `value` for both the input dictionary and its individual values is causing confusion, and the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs may also lead to incorrect command construction.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the individual values within the dictionary to avoid conflicts with the input dictionary. Additionally, we should construct the command without unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs to ensure proper command formation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value_dict):
    command = []
    if value_dict and isinstance(value_dict, dict):
        for prop, val in value_dict.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
In the corrected version, the input dictionary is named as `value_dict` to avoid conflicts, and the command is constructed without unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.
