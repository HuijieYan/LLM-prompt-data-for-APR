The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly formats the command list by adding quotation marks around the property=value pairs, which is not expected. The function should simply append the property=value pairs to the command list without quotation marks.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should be updated to properly format the command list without adding unnecessary quotation marks.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary quotation marks around the property=value pairs and appends the formatted pairs directly to the command list.

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
