The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable `value` is being used both as an input parameter and as a loop variable, causing a conflict. This is because the loop variable `value` is being assigned the same name as the input parameter `value`. As a result, the original input `value` is being overwritten during the loop iteration, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to change the name of the loop variable `value` to something different, so that it does not conflict with the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the loop variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the loop variable name from `value` to `val`, we avoid the conflict with the input parameter `value`, and the function should now work correctly.
