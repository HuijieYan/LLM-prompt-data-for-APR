The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into a string that can be added to the `command` list. The expected format is to have the key and value enclosed in double quotes and separated by an equal sign.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the way the key-value pairs are formatted before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that each key-value pair is properly formatted with double quotes and an equal sign before being added to the `command` list. It satisfies the expected input/output values for both test cases.
