To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to consider the existing logic and verify if it aligns with the test cases. The `_dict_arg` function populates the `command` list based on the input `value`, which is expected to be a dictionary.

The bug arises when building the `command` list. The issue is with the use of the `value` variable inside the loop, which overwrites the parameters passed to the function. This results in incorrect command construction, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable to something more specific to avoid overwriting the `value` function parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed the loop variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Updated 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```

By renaming the loop variable and using that variable for value assignment within the loop, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
