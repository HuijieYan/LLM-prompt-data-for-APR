The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly create the command list, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to properly format the dictionary values into the command list by iterating through the dictionary items and formatting them as required.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version properly iterates through the dictionary items, formats them as key-value pairs, and adds them to the command list. This should fix the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
