```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to "val" to avoid conflict with the outer "value"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the inner quotes around prop and val
    return command
```

Explanation:
1. The bug is caused by adding inner quotes around the prop and val when constructing the command list.
2. This results in the values being enclosed in double quotes, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect formatting of the command list elements with quotes while constructing the command.
4. To fix the bug, the inner quotes need to be removed when formatting the command list elements.
5. The corrected version of the function should remove the inner quotes and change the variable name from "value" to "val" to avoid conflict.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the inner quotes around prop and val
    return command
```
