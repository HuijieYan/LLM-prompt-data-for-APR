The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is incorrectly formatting the values in the command list, adding extra quotes and equals signs.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to properly format the values without adding unnecessary quotes and equals signs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass both failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
