The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly generating the command list by adding double quotes around the property and value. This is causing a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output for both failing test cases and pass the tests.
