The issue with the provided code is that it is wrapping the dictionary values in double quotes, which is causing the failing tests. The expected output does not have the double quotes around the property and value.

To fix this, we should remove the double quotes from the format string in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
