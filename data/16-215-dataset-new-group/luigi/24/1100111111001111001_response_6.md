The function _dict_arg is meant to take a dictionary and convert it into command line arguments. The bug in the function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary values into command line arguments.

The bug arises from the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```
Here, the value from the dictionary is being wrapped with double quotes, which is not needed as it is already being handled in the command list.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to properly format the command arguments without adding unnecessary double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now properly format the dictionary values into command line arguments without adding unnecessary double quotes.

This corrected version of the function should pass both failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
