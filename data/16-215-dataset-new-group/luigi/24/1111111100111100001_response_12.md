The issue is caused by the buggy function incorrectly formatting the dictionary values as strings with double quotes. This causes the assertion error in the test cases because the expected list of strings doesn't match the actual output due to the presence of double quotes in the actual output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property values when building the command list inside the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes from the format string
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly build the command list without including unnecessary double quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
