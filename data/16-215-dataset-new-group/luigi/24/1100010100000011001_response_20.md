## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command line arguments. However, the bug is caused by using the same variable name "value" in the loop, which overwrites the original value of "value" and "prop" parameter. This results in incorrect command generation.

## Bug
The bug is caused by overwriting the "value" variable in the loop, which leads to incorrect command generation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" and "prop" parameters. Additionally, the command should be constructed without quotes around the property and value.

## The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
