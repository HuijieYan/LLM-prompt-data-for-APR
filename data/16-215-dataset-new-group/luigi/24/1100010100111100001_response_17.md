The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding extra quotes around the value in the command list when the value is of type dictionary. This causes the assertion errors, as the format of the command list does not match the expected format.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the extra quotes around the value when building the command list for dictionary values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use 'val' instead of 'value' to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove extra quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing tests.
