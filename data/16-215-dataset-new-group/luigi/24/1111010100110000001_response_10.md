The buggy function is `_dict_arg` from the buggy class `SparkSubmitTask`. The cause of the error is that 'value' is being overwritten in the for loop. Moreover, single quote and double quote are mismatched for value. This results in an AssertionError when test case runs due to the wrong formatting of configuration properties passed to the spark-submit command. The single quote and double quote characters are interchanged. 

To fix the bug, the loop variable should be changed from `value` to something else. And only double quotes should be used to properly format the list of args.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With these changes, the test cases should pass without any errors.
