The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is incorrectly formatting the command list by enclosing the property-value pair in double quotes when building the command list. This is not necessary and causes the wrong formatting of the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property-value pair when adding it to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
