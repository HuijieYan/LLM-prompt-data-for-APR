The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function is incorrectly adding quotes around the values in the command list when it encounters a dictionary item. This is causing the assertion errors in the test cases, as the expected and actual command lists do not match.

To fix the bug, you should remove the unnecessary quotes around the values in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the values, and the failing test cases should pass.
