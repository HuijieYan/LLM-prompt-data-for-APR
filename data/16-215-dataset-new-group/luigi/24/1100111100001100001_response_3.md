The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly constructs the command by adding the name and formatted property-value pairs to the list. The bug is caused by reusing the variable name `value` within the for loop, which overwrites the input `value` argument.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + ' "{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
