## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the function not properly formatting the command list when the value is a dictionary. Instead of adding each key-value pair as a single string with the format of "key=value" to the command list, it is adding the key and value separately, resulting in an incorrect format.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the command list when the value is a dictionary. We should iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary and construct the format "key=value" before adding it to the command list.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # The corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix: Properly format the command list
        return command
```
After making this correction, the function should now properly format the command list when the value is a dictionary, and the tests should pass.
