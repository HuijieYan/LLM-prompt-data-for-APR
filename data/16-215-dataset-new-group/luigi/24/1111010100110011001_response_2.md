The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the fact that it is creating a list of command arguments, but the values from the input dictionary are being incorrectly concatenated with quotes, which is leading to the assertion errors in the tests. The input values should not have double quotes, as they are being added incorrectly in the command list. Additionally, the name and value parameters are currently ambiguous and may lead to confusion.

In order to fix this bug, we should update the `_dict_arg` function to correctly generate the command list without adding unnecessary quotes to the values. We can achieve this by removing the unnecessary quotes from the string formatting and updating the variable names to be more descriptive.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, arg_name, arg_value):
    command = []
    if arg_value and isinstance(arg_value, dict):
        for key, value in arg_value.items():
            command += [arg_name, key + '=' + str(value)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should address the bug by appropriately generating the command list with the correct key-value pairs, without adding unnecessary quotes. This will ensure that the tests pass and the function behaves as expected.
