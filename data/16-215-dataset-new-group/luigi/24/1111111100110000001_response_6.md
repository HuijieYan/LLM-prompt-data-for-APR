The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class incorrectly formats the command, leading to the `AssertionErrors` in the failing tests. The function assembles the command by adding items to the list `command`. However, for dictionary values, the function should be formatting each item as `prop=value` rather than as `"{prop}={value}"`. Therefore, the bug occurs because the function incorrectly formats the values when creating the command.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_dict_arg` function to directly append `prop=value` items to the `command` list when a dictionary value is encountered, rather than concatenating strings in the incorrect format.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By using `{}` in the `format` function, it correctly constructs the `prop=value` format required for the command. This updated function should now pass the failing tests.
