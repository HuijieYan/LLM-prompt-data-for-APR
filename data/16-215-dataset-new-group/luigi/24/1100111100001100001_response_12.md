The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the variable reassignment of `value` within the for loop. This causes the original `value` parameter to be overwritten, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the inner loop. We can use something like `val` instead of `value` to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to val
            command.append('{} "{}={}"'.format(name, prop, val))  # Changed the string formatting
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly construct the command list without overwriting the original `value` parameter.
