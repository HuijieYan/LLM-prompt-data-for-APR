The cause of the error is due to the _dict_arg method in the class SparkSubmitTask which uses the append operation on the command list in a for loop to add a new command, and it also tries to format the string after generating it. This approach is flawed and causes the test cases to fail.

The ValueError is due to the mismatch in the format of the string expected versus the actual value. The expected strings should have prop=value, but the actual string includes it as "prop=value". Also, there are redundant quotations in the command list generation logic.

To fix the bug, instead of formatting command strings and appending them to the command list in a loop, a new list is initialized, and each command is directly added using the correct format prop=value, then the new list will be concatenated to the command list. Ensure the function checks for the proper input and handle edge cases effectively.

### The corrected version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            arg_list = []
            for prop, value in value.items():
                arg_list += [name, prop + '=' + value]             
            command += arg_list
        return command
```
With this fixed version, the format of the command list will be correct and will pass the test cases, resolving the mismatch in the expected and actual outcomes.
