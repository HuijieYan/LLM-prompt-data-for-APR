The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding quotes around the value of the property in the `command` list. This is causing the test cases to fail as they are expecting the property and value to be added without quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This should fix the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
