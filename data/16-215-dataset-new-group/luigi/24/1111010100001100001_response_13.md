## Explanation
The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly constructing the command list. Specifically, it is not handling the format of the command string correctly when adding the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

The input dictionary items are being added to the command list with extra quotes and an equal sign, resulting in a malformed command.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the _dict_arg function, the format of the command string needs to be adjusted to properly add the key-value pairs from the input dictionary without extra quotes and an equal sign.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
