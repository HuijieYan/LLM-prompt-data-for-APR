In the given buggy function `_dict_arg`, there are a couple of potential error locations:

1. The variable `value` is being reused for two different purposes: as the input parameter and as the value in the `for` loop. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

2. The `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` statement might not work as intended, as it checks if `value` is truthy before checking if it's a dictionary. This could lead to incorrect evaluation.

The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being overwritten in the for loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the conditional check for a valid dictionary may not work as intended.

To fix the bug, the variable names should be distinct, and the conditional check should be restructured for clarity and correct evaluation.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, input_dict):
    command = []
    if input_dict and isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        for key, val in input_dict.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
- Variable `value` has been renamed to `input_dict` to clarify its purpose.
- The `if input_dict and isinstance(input_dict, dict):` condition explicitly checks first for input_dict being truthy and then if it's a dictionary.
- The loop variables have been renamed to `key` and `val` to avoid confusion with the function parameter.
