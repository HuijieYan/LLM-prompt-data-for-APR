The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable, which causes it to be incorrect when used in the loop. This is because the loop's iterating variable `value` is the same as the input parameter `value`. This causes the loop to only use the inner values of the dictionary, resulting in incorrect command construction.

We can fix this bug by changing the loop variable name to something other than `value`, to avoid overwriting the input parameter. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using a different variable name to avoid overwriting the input parameter
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This change will ensure that the input `value` remains unchanged, and the loop iterates over the key-value pairs correctly to construct the `command` list as expected. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
