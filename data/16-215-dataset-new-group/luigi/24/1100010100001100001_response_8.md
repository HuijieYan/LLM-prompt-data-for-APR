The issue in the buggy function is with the way the command list is generated. The function is not considering the name parameter when building the command list, resulting in the incorrect command structure.

The bug is caused by the variable name being overwritten in the for-loop, and then used in the command list without its original value. This results in the wrong format for the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for-loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter 'name' value. Then, we should format the command list using the correct name and the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
