To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values in the dictionary are added to the command list without quotes. This means modifying the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
