To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we can modify the way the command list is constructed. Instead of enclosing the property and value in double quotes, we can directly append them to the command list without quotes. Also, we need to handle the case where the value is not a dictionary and return an empty list in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Modify the way elements are appended to the command list
    return command
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
