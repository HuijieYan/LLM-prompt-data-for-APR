The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the use of double quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list, resulting in the AssertionError when comparing the expected and actual command lists. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pairs when forming the command list. We need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property=value pairs in the command list to fix the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
