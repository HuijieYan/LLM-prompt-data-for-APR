The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is wrapping the key-value pairs in double quotes, which is causing the comparison to fail. 

To fix the bug, we should not wrap the key-value pairs in double quotes when creating the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the key-value pairs will not be wrapped in double quotes, and the comparison in the test cases should pass successfully.
