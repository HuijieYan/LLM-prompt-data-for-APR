The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the way it constructs the command list. The function is incorrectly adding extra quotation marks around the property-value pairs, which causes the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, we should remove the extra quotation marks around the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
