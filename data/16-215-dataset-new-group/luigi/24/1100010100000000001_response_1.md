## Potential Errors:
1. The function is using the variable name "value" for two different purposes, which could lead to confusion and errors.
2. The function is not handling the case when the value is not a dictionary.
3. The function is not properly formatting the command list.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by reusing the variable name "value" for both the input value and the values in the dictionary. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors when trying to construct the command list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the variable name "value" in the for loop to avoid confusion with the input value.
2. Add a check to handle the case when the input value is not a dictionary.
3. Use proper formatting to construct the command list.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, key, val))
    return command
```
