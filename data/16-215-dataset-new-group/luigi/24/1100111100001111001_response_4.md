The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into the command list. The function is intended to take a name and a dictionary as input and format the dictionary key-value pairs into a string that is appended to the `command` list. The bug is that it's not correctly formatting the key-value pairs and is also adding quotes where they are not needed.

The cause of the bug is that the function is using a string interpolation with double quotes around the format, which is causing the key-value pairs to be formatted incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function should format the key-value pairs without quotes and add the formatted string directly to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} {prop}={val}")
    return command
```

This corrected version uses f-strings to directly format the key-value pairs into the desired string format and appends it to the `command` list. With this fix, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
