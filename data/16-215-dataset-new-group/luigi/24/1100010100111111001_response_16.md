The cause of the bug is that the function appends the `value` with quotes while constructing the `command` list. However, the expected input wants the value to be appended without quotes. This causes the assertion error in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the function needs to construct the `command` list without adding quotes to the `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now construct the `command` list without adding quotes to the `value`, which aligns with the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution.
