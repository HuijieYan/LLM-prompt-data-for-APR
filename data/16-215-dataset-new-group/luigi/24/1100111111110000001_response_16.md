The cause of the bug is on line 9 of the buggy function `_dict_arg`. The string format should not be enclosed in double quotes because this is later paired with the prop string which already includes double quotes. Using `format()` to create a combined string is sufficient. 

```python
# Updated Corrected version
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
