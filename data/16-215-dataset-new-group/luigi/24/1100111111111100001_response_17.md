Based on the input parameters and the observed behavior of the buggy function, it appears that the function is incorrectly formatting the command list when the input value is a dictionary. It is adding extra quotes around the property-value pair, leading to the assertion errors in the failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding extra quotes around the property-value pair.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
