The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into the `command` list. The current implementation is using double quotes around the entire key-value pair, which is not necessary. Additionally, the dictionary keys and values should be separated by an equal sign without quotes.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to correctly format the dictionary items into the `command` list without unnecessary quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs into the `command` list without unnecessary quotes, satisfying the expected input/output values.
