The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is overwriting the `value` variable used in the loop with the loop variable. This causes the function to return unexpected command lists, which leads to failing the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable in the for loop to something other than `value`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed the loop variable to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the `_dict_arg` function should now return the correct command lists and pass the failing test cases.
