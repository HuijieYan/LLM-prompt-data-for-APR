The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding double quotes around the value of each property in the dictionary before adding it to the `command` list. This is causing the test cases to fail because the expected input values do not include double quotes around the property values.

To fix this bug, you should remove the double quotes from around the format string and just directly insert the property and value into the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
