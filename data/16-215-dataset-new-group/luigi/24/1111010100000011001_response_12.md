## Explanation
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a dictionary as input and return a list of command-line arguments. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
1. The function does not handle the case where `value` is an empty dictionary or not a dictionary at all.
2. The function overwrites the `value` variable within the loop, which causes unexpected behavior.

## Bug fixing strategy
To fix the bug, we can follow these steps:
1. Check if the `value` is a dictionary and is not empty. If it is empty or not a dictionary, return an empty list.
2. Use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value`.

## The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
