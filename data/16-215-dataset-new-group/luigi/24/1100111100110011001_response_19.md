The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a `name` and a `value` as input, and if the `value` is a dictionary, it should iterate through the key-value pairs and construct a command list accordingly. The issues in the function are related to formatting the command list.

The first issue is that the function is adding double quotes to the value when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch with the expected output where the value should not be enclosed in double quotes.

The second issue is that the name used in the command list is not directly related to the `name` parameter passed to the function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to:
1. Remove the double quotes around the value when constructing the command list.
2. Ensure that the correct `name` is used in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing tests and return the expected values for the specified input parameters.
