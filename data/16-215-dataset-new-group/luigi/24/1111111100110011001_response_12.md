The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This is causing the test to fail because the expected command list does not include the double quotes around the property value.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property value and just append the property and value as is.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version of the function removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property value and constructs the command list as expected by the test cases. This change will make the function pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
