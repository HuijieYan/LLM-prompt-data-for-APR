The potential error in the _dict_arg function is that the value is being overwritten as a loop variable, which will cause unexpected behavior. Additionally, the string concatenation in the command list may be incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the loop variable 'value' is being overwritten by the value from the dictionary, and this can result in unexpected behavior. Also, the string formatting for command concatenation may not be correct.

To fix the bug, we can change the loop variable name from "value" to something else, and also modify the string formatting for command concatenation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{key}={val}"')
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we use a different variable name (key, val) for the loop variable to avoid overwriting the value parameter. We also use f-strings for string formatting and append the formatted string directly to the command list.
