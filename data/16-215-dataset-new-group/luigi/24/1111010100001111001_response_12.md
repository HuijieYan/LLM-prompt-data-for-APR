The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property-value pair in the command list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the quotes around the property-value pair while appending it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
