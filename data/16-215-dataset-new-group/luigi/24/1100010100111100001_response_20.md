The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the use of double quotes in the command list for dictionary values.

The function is supposed to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command parts, each part being a key-value pair. However, when the function encounters a key-value pair, it adds double quotes around the value, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should remove the double quotes from around the value in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
