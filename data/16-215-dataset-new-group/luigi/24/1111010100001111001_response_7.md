The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not correctly formatting the command list when `value` is a dictionary. The function should construct the command list in the format `name="prop=value"` for each key-value pair in the dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that the function is mistakenly encapsulating the entire `prop=value` string in double quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list by directly concatenating the `name`, `prop`, and `value` without encapsulating the `prop=value` string in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}={prop}={val}')
    return command
```

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
