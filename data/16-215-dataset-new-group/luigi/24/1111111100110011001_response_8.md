The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is adding double quotes around the property=value pair when creating the command list. This is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes from around the property=value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
