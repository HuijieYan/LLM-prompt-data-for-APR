The bug in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the bug that occurs when formatting the values in the command list. The function is currently wrapping the values in double quotes, which leads to a mismatch in the expected and actual values when comparing the lists in the test cases. The function should not wrap the values in double quotes.

To fix the bug, you should remove the double quotes from around the formatted values in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly produce the command list without wrapping the values in double quotes.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
