## Analysis
This buggy function is supposed to take a name and a value as input, and if the value is a dictionary, it iterates over the dictionary items and appends them to a command list in a specific format. However, the bug is that the variable name used in the for loop is overwriting the input parameter name.

## Bug
The bug is that the variable name used in the for loop is the same as the input parameter name, which causes the input parameter name to be overwritten and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the variable name used in the for loop should be different from the input parameter name. This means using a different name for the loop variable, such as prop in this case.

## Corrected code
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
