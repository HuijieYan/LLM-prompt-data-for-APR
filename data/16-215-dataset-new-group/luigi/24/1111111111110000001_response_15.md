The `_dict_arg` function is intended to convert key-value pairs in a dictionary into CLI arguments. However, the current implementation has a flaw that modifies spaces between the key-value pairs, leading to misinterpretation of the list as a whole by the test.

The issue arises from how the function constructs the command list. It concatenates the `name` and `value` in the for loop, and wraps the value in double quotes. This wrapping leads to incorrect arguments in the final command list when the entire command is constructed later.

To correct this, one way to fix the bug is to change the `for` loop implementation to avoid issues with quoting certain characters. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function that should pass the tests:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the for loop processes the dictionary items and ensures correct space separation for each key-value pair. The wrapping each key-value pair in double quotes is not necessary.

With the corrected function, the provided tests should pass without any issues.
