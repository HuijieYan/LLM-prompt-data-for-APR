The issue with the buggy function appears to be caused by the format of the command list being generated. The values in the dictionary are being added to the command list with double quotes, which causes the failing tests due to formatting mismatches.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the values when adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Changed variable name to prop_value to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Removed the double quotes around prop and prop_value
    return command
```

With this correction, the failing tests should pass.
