The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is incorrectly adding quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list it generates. These quotes are not required and are causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should remove the unnecessary quotes from the property-value pairs it adds to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]  # removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary quotes when constructing the command list, the corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
