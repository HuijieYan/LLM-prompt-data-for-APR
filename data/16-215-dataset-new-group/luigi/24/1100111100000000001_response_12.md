The buggy function `_dict_arg` takes three arguments `self`, `name`, and `value`. It is supposed to iterate through the key-value pairs of the `value` dictionary and add them to the `command` list. However, there are a couple of potential error locations in the function:

1. The variable `value` is being overwritten by the loop variable `value` in the for loop.
2. The format string `"{0}={1}"` should have a space after the equal sign to make it compatible with the expected format.

The cause of the bug is that the loop variable `value` overwrites the function argument `value`, leading to unexpected behavior. Also, the format string needs to be corrected to ensure the proper formatting of the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable in the for loop to something other than `value` to avoid overwriting the function argument. Additionally, we can correct the format string to ensure the key-value pairs are formatted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
