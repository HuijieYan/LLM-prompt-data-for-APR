The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. It is adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to construct the `command` list without adding double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the `command` list as expected, and the failing tests should pass.
