The issue with the function is that it is overwriting the variable `value` within the for loop, which leads to incorrect command construction. To fix this, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the input `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variable `value` to `val` in the for loop, we avoid overwriting the input `value` and correctly construct the command list.

This should fix the bug that was causing incorrect command construction and resolve the issues seen in the failing tests.
