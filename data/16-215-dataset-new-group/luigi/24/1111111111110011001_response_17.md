The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is incorrectly constructing the `command` list when `value` is a dictionary. The bug is caused by using double quotes around the values within the `command` list. This causes the failing tests to compare the actual result with the expected result and find a mismatch due to the extra double quotes.

To fix the bug, the double quotes need to be removed when constructing the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, v)]  # removed double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the buggy function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
