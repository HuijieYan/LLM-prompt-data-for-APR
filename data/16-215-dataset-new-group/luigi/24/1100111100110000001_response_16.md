Looking at the error messages, it is evident that the failing test is caused by a problem in the `_dict_arg` function inside the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. The error message suggests that the values derived from a dictionary are being wrapped with unnecessary quotes, which results in a mismatch when compared to the expected values.

The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to construct a command from key-value pairs provided in a dictionary. However, it seems to be wrapping both the property and the value in unnecessary quotes, causing issues with the command construction.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command without adding quotes around each key-value pair. Here's a modified version of the `_dict_arg` function to address the issue:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # modified to remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

In this modified version, we've removed the unnecessary quotes from the command construction process, which should resolve the issue. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
