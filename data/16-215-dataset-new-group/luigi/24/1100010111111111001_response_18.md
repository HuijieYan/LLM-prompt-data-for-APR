The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding quotation marks around the property-value pair when constructing the `command` list. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected values do not have quotation marks around the property-value pairs.

To fix this bug, the extra quotation marks should be removed when constructing the `command` list.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed the extra quotation marks
    return command
```

This fix should ensure that the function constructs the `command` list without adding unnecessary quotation marks around the property-value pairs, which aligns with the expected output values.
