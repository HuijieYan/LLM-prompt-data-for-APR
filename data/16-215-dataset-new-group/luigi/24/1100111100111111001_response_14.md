The issue is that the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the `command` list. The bug is caused by including double quotes around the value when formatting the command list, which is not expected.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the value when formatting the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to val to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {1}
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the command list according to the expected input/output values for both cases provided.
