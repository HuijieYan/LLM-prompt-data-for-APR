The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that the command list is not being constructed properly due to the re-use of the variable name "value" inside the for loop, which overrides the original value passed to the function.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name within the for loop to avoid overwriting the original value passed to the function.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name to 'val' to avoid overwriting the original value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the _dict_arg function should now construct the command list correctly and pass the failing test.
