## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function seems to be taking a `name` and `value` as input and then looping through the dictionary `value` to create a list of `name=value` pairs in the `command` list. The function should be returning the `command` list at the end.

The potential error location could be the way the `name` and `value` variables are re-used within the function, which might lead to unintended behavior.

The failing test calls the function with a dictionary of spark configuration settings, and the expected result is a list of command-line arguments that should be passed to the `spark-submit` command. It seems that the failing test is not getting the correct command-line arguments, which indicates that the `_dict_arg` function is not working as expected.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` inside the for loop, which overwrites the original `value` passed to the function. This causes the function to generate incorrect command-line arguments.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` passed to the function. Additionally, we need to properly format the name-value pairs to create the command list.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the different variable name
    return command
```
