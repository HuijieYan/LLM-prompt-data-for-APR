The issue with the buggy function is that the value from the dictionary is being overwritten by the loop variable in the for loop within the _dict_arg function. This results in incorrect command generation.

To fix this, we can change the loop variable name from "value" to something else so that it doesn't overwrite the input value variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the val variable here instead of value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary.

This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
