The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is creating a list of command arguments incorrectly. It is adding extra double quotes around the values when it shouldn't. This causes the failing tests to fail as they are expecting the command arguments to be formatted without the extra quotes.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to not include the extra double quotes around the values when creating the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val to avoid shadowing
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove the extra double quotes around the value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the command list without adding extra double quotes around the values.

This should fix the failing tests.
