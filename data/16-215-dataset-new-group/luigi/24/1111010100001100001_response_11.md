The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it only adds the name parameter once to the command list, and then it adds the key-value pair as a single string within double quotes. This is not the correct format for adding key-value pairs to a command list. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the command list by separating the key and value with an equals sign, and not encapsulating the entire key-value pair within double quotes. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, we ensure that the command list is constructed properly, with the name parameter being added for each key-value pair, and the key and value being separated by an equals sign.

This will fix the bug and ensure that the command list is constructed correctly for all input scenarios.
