The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a name and a dictionary of values and convert it into a list of command line arguments. However, it contains a bug where the same variable `value` is used for both the input dictionary and for iterating through the items of the dictionary, causing a conflict.

The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being redefined within the for loop, which leads to confusion and incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we can rename the iterator variable in the for loop to a different name so that it does not conflict with the input dictionary. Additionally, we should add a check to see if the input dictionary is empty or not to avoid unnecessary iterations in the for loop.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the variable to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly convert the input dictionary into a list of command line arguments and pass the failing tests.
