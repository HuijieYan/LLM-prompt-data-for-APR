## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to iterate over a dictionary and create a list of commands based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, the bug in the function lies in the fact that the loop variable `value` is being used to iterate over the dictionary as well as being used to store the value of the dictionary. This causes the loop to overwrite the original `value` parameter, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` for both the loop iteration and storing the value from the dictionary. This overwriting of the variable causes incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable to store the value during the loop iteration. We should also rename the input parameter to clarify its usage.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, input_dict):
    command = []
    if input_dict and isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        for prop, val in input_dict.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
