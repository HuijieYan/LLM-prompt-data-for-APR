## Fixing the bug

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the variable name collision. The input parameter `value` is being overwritten by the loop variable `value` in the for loop. This causes the function to incorrectly construct the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable in the for loop. 

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed loop variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the `value` parameter will no longer be overwritten by the loop variable, and the function should produce the correct output for the given test cases.
