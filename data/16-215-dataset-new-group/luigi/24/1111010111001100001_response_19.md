Potential error location:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to create a command list based on the input name and value. However, the code incorrectly uses the same variable name `value` in the loop to unpack the dictionary items and as an input parameter, causing conflicts and incorrect behavior.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the variable name `value` in the loop to unpack the dictionary items. This causes the command list to be incorrectly constructed with extra quotation marks and equal signs.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration, so that it does not conflict with the input parameter `value`. Additionally, we need to construct the command list without unnecessary quotation marks and equal signs.


## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use a different variable name for the loop iteration
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # construct the command list without unnecessary quotation marks
    return command
```
