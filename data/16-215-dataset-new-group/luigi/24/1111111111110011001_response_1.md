## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid variable name conflict
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid variable name conflict
        return command
```

By changing the internal variable name from 'value' to 'val' in the loop and using the correct variable 'val' when constructing the command list, the corrected function should now correctly build the command list elements. This should resolve the assertion errors that were encountered in the failing tests.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
