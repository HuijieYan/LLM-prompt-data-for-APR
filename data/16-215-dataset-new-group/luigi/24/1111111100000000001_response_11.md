# Corrected version of the buggy function

The corrected version of the function would be:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change the variable name to avoid conflict with outer value
            command += [name, '{0}="{1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Remove extra quotes around the property and value
    return command
```

Explanation:
1. The buggy function is within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. It is a method meant to construct command-line arguments based on dictionary inputs.
2. The potential error locations in the original function include the variable naming conflict, missing quotes in the constructed command, and potential issues with handling the dictionary input.
3. The bug was caused by using the same variable name `value` in the for loop, which resulted in overwriting the outer scope `value` variable. Additionally, extra quotes were added around the property and value in the command generation.
4. To fix the bug, the variable name in the for loop should be changed to avoid naming conflicts, and the extra quotes in the command generation should be removed.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided above.
