The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is not correctly parsing the dictionary arguments and adding them to the `command` list. It is adding double quotes around the dictionary values which is causing the failing tests due to assertion errors comparing the actual command to the expected command.

The line in question is causing the issue:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

To fix the issue, we should remove the double quotes around the values when constructing the `command` list for each dictionary item. 

Also, a check is added to ignore empty or None values for 'prop' and 'value' in the dictionary. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            if prop is not None and value is not None:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

After the fix, the corrected function properly constructs the command list without adding double quotes around the dictionary values, ensuring the expected and actual commands are consistent and removing the assertion errors in the failing tests.
