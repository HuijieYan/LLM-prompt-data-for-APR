The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be caused by the reassignment of the `value` variable inside the for loop. This causes the confusion between the input value and the loop variable which leads to incorrect output. The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary input and convert it into a list of commands, appending each key-value pair as a string to the `command` list. 

To fix the bug, we should avoid reusing the variable name `value` inside the loop and modify the way the strings are formatted and appended to the `command` list to ensure correct output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{key}={val}"')
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we have renamed the loop variables to `key` and `val` to avoid conflict with the input variable `value`. Additionally, we use the `append` method to add formatted strings to the `command` list. The use of f-strings also simplifies the string formatting process.

With these changes, the function should now correctly build the `command` list based on the input dictionary.
