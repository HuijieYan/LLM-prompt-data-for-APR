The potential error location within the buggy function is the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line. This line is concatenating the command list with the value as a string without quotations, which may cause the command to be incorrectly formatted when using it in the subprocess.Popen call in the test code.

The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function does not correctly format the command list when the value is a dictionary.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should be modified to handle the dictionary format properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Use correct string formatting here
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the string formatting is adjusted to correctly format the command list for each item in the dictionary.

After making this change, the `_dict_arg` function should work correctly and pass the failing tests.
