The bug in the _dict_arg function is that the loop variable "value" is being overwritten by the inner loop iteration variable. This is because the loop variable "value" is being used for both the outer and inner loop, causing unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the inner loop iteration variable should be named differently to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the inner loop iteration variable to "val" instead of "value", we can prevent the overwriting issue and generate the correct command list based on the input dictionary.

This correction ensures that each key-value pair in the input dictionary is correctly formatted and added to the command list without overwriting any variables.
