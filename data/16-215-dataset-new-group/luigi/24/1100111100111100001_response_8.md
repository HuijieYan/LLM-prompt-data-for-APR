The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly encapsulating the values of the dictionary key-value pairs in double quotes, resulting in assertions failing when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the double quotes around the values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {1}
    return command
```
