The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class has a few potential errors:

1. The function is not using the `name` argument within the loop, and it's getting overwritten by the inner loop variable `prop`.
2. The strings generated by `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` could potentially create issues with double-quoting.

The cause of the bug is that the `value` is being processed inappropriately in the for loop, and also the string formatting within the loop is not correct. This could potentially lead to incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, the correct method to handle the inner loop variable should be used, and the string formatting should be adjusted to avoid errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the loop variable is renamed to `val` to avoid shadowing the `value` argument. Additionally, the `extend` method is used instead of the `+=` operator to append elements to the `command` list. The string formatting has also been updated to remove unnecessary double quotes.
