The buggy function `_dict_arg` appears to be intended to build a command for submitting a Spark job with arguments in key-value pairs. However, there are a few potential error locations in the function:

1. The variable `value` is used as both the input argument and as an iteration variable in the loop, which could lead to confusion and potential errors.
2. The `name` should be included in the command for each key-value pair, but it's only added once outside the loop.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly constructing the command for submitting a Spark job with key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we can use a new variable for the iteration, and we should include the `name` for each key-value pair in the command.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, val in value.items():  # Use separate variables for iteration
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]  # Include name for each key-value pair
        return command
```

In the corrected version, we have addressed the potential errors by using separate variables for iteration and including the `name` for each key-value pair in the command.
