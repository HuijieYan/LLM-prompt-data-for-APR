The cause of the bug in the provided function is that it wraps values in the dictionary with double quotes, which makes it fail the tests. Instead of wrapping the values with double quotes, the values should be added directly. The buggy function incorrectly constructs the command giving additional double quotes to the values resulting in assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to construct the command correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass without any assertion errors.
