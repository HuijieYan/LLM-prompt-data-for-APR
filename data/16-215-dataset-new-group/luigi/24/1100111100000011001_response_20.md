The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's overwriting the `value` variable that is used in the loop with the input parameter `value`. This causes the loop to use the wrong value and consequently generate incorrect `command` list.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to use a different variable for the loop, so that it doesn't overwrite the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use val instead of value
    return command
```
