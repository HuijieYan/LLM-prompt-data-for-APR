To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. The quotes are causing the failing tests because they are not expected in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
