The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it overwrites the variable `value` by using the same name for the loop iteration. This causes the function to incorrectly use `value` as a string in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the original `value`. We can change the loop variable name from `value` to something like `val` to resolve this issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
