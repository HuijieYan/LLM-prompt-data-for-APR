The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the `command` list. 

The function should iterate through the dictionary and add each key-value pair to the `command` list in the format: `"{name}={prop}={value}"`. However, the current implementation is only adding `name` and `prop` to the `command` list without properly formatting the value.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly format the key-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly format the key-value pairs and add them to the `command` list, which should satisfy the expected input/output values and make the failing tests pass.
