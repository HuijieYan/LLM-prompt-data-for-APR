The buggy function `_dict_arg` seems to be designed to convert a dictionary into a command list for Spark submission. However, there are a couple of potential issues with the function:

1. The function doesn't seem to be handling the case where `value` is not a dictionary. It should perhaps return an empty list if `value` is not a dictionary.

2. The function uses `value` as the iterating variable in the loop, which overwrites the function parameter `value`. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix these issues, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we check if `value` is a dictionary before iterating over its items, and we use a different variable name (`val`) in the loop to avoid overwriting the function parameter `value`.

This should address the potential issues identified and make the function more robust.
