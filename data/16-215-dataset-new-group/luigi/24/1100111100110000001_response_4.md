The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function takes input in the form of a name and a value. It then iterates over the dictionary while building the command list and includes the name parameter and value in the final command. The bug arises from the fact that in the failing test, the value in the dictionary does not have quotes around the key-value pair, causing discrepancies in the expected and actual lists that are being compared in the assertions.

The function is currently including the `value` with quotes in the final command list, leading to the mismatch between actual and expected values.

To resolve this bug, the value needs to be checked for quotes before appending to the `command` list and added accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will now add quotes based on the type of the value in the dictionary, and this will result in the correct command list, passing the failing tests.
