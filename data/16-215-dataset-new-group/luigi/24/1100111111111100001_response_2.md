The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the value when creating the `command` list. This is causing the test cases to fail when comparing the expected and actual values, as the formatting of the strings is different.

To fix this, the double quotes should be removed from the format string when building the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the double quotes will no longer be added around the property values, which should resolve the failing test cases.
