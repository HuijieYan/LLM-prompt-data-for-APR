## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command = [name]  # Initialize the command list with the name
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use variable name val instead of value to avoid confusion
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))  # Append the formatted string to the command list
        return command  # Return the command list
    else:
        return []  # Return an empty list if value is not a dictionary or is empty
```

### Analysis and Explanation
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and a dictionary as input, construct a list of command arguments, and return that list. However, the bug occurs in the loop where the `command` list is constructed. The bug is primarily caused by the reuse of the variable `value` inside the loop, which overrides the input `value` and causes incorrect command construction.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the variable name inside the loop should be changed to something different than `value` to avoid confusion and potential errors. Additionally, the command list should be initialized with the `name` before the loop starts.

The corrected version of the function follows the suggested strategy by using a different variable name (`val`) inside the loop and initializing the `command` list with the `name` before the loop.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function constructs the command list correctly.
