The buggy function appears to be incorrectly formatting the command list when the input value is a dictionary. It is not handling the values correctly, resulting in incorrect command list generation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly iterating through the dictionary values and constructing the command list with the correct formatting.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through the dictionary items, format the values properly, and append them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly construct the command list and pass the failing tests.
