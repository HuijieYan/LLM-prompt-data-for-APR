The potential error in the _dict_arg function is that it is reusing the variable name "value" within the for loop, which overwrites the input value to the function. 

The cause of the bug is that the for loop is using the same variable name "value" as the input parameter, which overwrites the original value passed to the function. This can cause unexpected behavior when trying to construct the command list.

To fix the bug, the variable name in the for loop should be changed to avoid overwriting the input value. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
