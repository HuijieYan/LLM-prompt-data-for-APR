## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to take a `name` and a `value`, check if the value is a dictionary, and if so, add each key-value pair to the `command` list in a specific format. However, it seems to be adding unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list.

The error messages indicate that the `command` list is not being constructed correctly, leading to differences between the expected and actual command list.

## Bug identification
1. The function is concatenating the name and formatted value with unnecessary double quotes in the command list.
2. In the second test case, it is also quoting the entire value in the command list, which is incorrect.

## Bug cause
The cause of the bug is in the formatting of the key-value pairs when adding them to the command list. The incorrect use of quotes around the values and an extra layer of quoting in some cases is causing the command lists to be different from the expected ones.

## Bug fix
To fix the bug, the function should format the key-value pairs without adding double quotes around the entire value and remove the extra layer of quoting. String formatting should be used to achieve this.

## Corrected code
```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With these changes, the function will correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes and will format the key-value pairs as expected. This corrected code should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
