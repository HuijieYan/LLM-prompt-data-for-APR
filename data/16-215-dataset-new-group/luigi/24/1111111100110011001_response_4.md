Based on the error messages, it seems that the `_dict_arg` function is not handling the dictionary values correctly. It is currently adding double quotes around the property=value pairs, which is causing the comparison to fail in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes when constructing the command list and update the function to handle the dictionary values properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function will construct the command list without adding extra double quotes around the property=value pairs, as required by the test cases. This should resolve the failing tests.
