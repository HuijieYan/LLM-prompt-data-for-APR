The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not handling the values in the dictionary correctly. The values should be added to the command list as separate elements, but the current implementation is treating them as a single string.

The cause of the bug is that the `value` is being formatted as a single string, including the property name and value, instead of being split into separate strings.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop inside the `_dict_arg` function to add the property and value as separate elements in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list with separate elements for each property-value pair, which should resolve the failing tests.
