The bug is caused by the _dict_arg function adding extra double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in the command list containing incorrect items when compared to the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes added to the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the extra double quotes
    return command
```

The corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list, allowing it to generate the correct output and pass the failing tests.
