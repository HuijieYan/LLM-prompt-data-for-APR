The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and a value and convert the value into a list of command-line arguments. However, the bug occurs because the variable `value` is being overwritten in the for loop, causing unexpected behavior. 

To fix this bug, we can simply use a different variable name for the loop iteration, so it doesn't conflict with the input variable name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly process the input dictionary and return the expected list of command-line arguments.
