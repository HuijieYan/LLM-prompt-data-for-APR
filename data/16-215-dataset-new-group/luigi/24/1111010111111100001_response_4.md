The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the use of double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs in the `command` list. The failing test cases indicate that the expected output does not include the double quotes, causing the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs in the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
