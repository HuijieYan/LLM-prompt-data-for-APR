The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property values when creating the command list. This is causing the assertion errors in the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the property values when adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list without adding extra quotes around the property values. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
