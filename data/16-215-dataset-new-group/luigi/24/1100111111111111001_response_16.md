The function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a dictionary `value` and construct a command list by iterating through the key-value pairs and appending them to the command list. However, the function is not properly formatting the command list, leading to failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. Specifically, it is not enclosing the values in double quotes as expected in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly format the key-value pairs into the command list, ensuring that the values are enclosed in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Enclose val in double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list, satisfying the expected input/output values for the failing tests.
