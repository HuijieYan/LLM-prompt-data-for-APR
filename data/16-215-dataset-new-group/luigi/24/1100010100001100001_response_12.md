The bug in the given function is caused by reusing the variable name "value" in the for loop to iterate over the dictionary items. This overwrites the original "value" input parameter, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the variable inside the for loop is changed from "value" to "val" to avoid overwriting the original input parameter.
