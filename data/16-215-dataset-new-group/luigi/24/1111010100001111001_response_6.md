## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name value to val to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Change variable name value to val
    return command
```

The bug in the original function is caused by the use of the variable name "value" both as the input parameter name and as an iterator variable within the for loop. This leads to the overwriting of the original "value" parameter, resulting in incorrect string formatting and command construction.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to change the variable name "value" within the for loop to a different name, such as "val", to avoid overwriting the original parameter. Additionally, we also need to update the variable name "value" within the command construction to "val" to correctly format the string.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now produce the expected output values for the given input cases.
