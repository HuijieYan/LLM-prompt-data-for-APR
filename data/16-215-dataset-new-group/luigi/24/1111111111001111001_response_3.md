The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the `value` dictionary into a list of command arguments. The function is currently iterating over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, but it is not formatting the arguments correctly before adding them to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to format the arguments as `"key=value"` before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the `value` dictionary will be properly formatted into a list of command arguments, and it will pass the failing test cases.
