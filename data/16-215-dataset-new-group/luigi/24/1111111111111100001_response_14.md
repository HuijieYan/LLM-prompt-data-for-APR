The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when creating the command list. This is resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After making this change, the function should pass the failing tests.
