The bug in the function is due to the use of double quotes around the property and value in the generated command list. The quotes are not necessary and cause the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should generate the command list without including unnecessary quotes around the property and value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version simply concatenates the property and value using the "=" symbol without any quotes. This should resolve the issues with the failing test cases and produce the expected command list output.

The corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values for both test cases, ensuring that the generated command list does not include unnecessary quotes around the property and value.
