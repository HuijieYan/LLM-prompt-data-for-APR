It appears that the _dict_arg function is failing to produce the expected command list. There are several issues:
1. It is not producing the expected key-value pairs for flags and separated values with equality signs in the format "name=prop".
2. It is wrapping property values in double quotes, which is causing differences in the assertions.
3. The cause of the error in the failed test is the difference between the generated command and the expected command. It is expecting key-value pairs in the command like "--conf", "prop1=val1", but getting key-value pairs like "--conf", '"prop1=val1"'.

To fix these issues, the _dict_arg function should be updated to generate a properly formatted command list.

Here's a corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass.
