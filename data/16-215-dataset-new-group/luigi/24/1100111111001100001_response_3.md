The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable, which is causing the incorrect output. When iterating through the items in the dictionary, the variable `value` is being reused, leading to incorrect command formation.

To fix the bug, we need to change the variable name from `value` to something else within the for loop to avoid overwriting the input value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This fixed version should pass the failing tests.
