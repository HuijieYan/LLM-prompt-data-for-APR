One potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is reusing the `value` variable name for both the function parameter and the loop variable. This could lead to confusion and incorrect results.

The cause of the bug could be that the loop variable `value` is overwriting the original `value` parameter, causing unexpected behavior when building the `command` list.

To fix this bug, you can rename the loop variable to something else to prevent confusion and make sure the original `value` parameter is not modified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename loop variable to 'val'
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use 'val' instead of 'value'
        return command
```

This corrected version should address the bug and prevent the variable name collision.
