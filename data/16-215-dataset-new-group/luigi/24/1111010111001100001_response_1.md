The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not correctly construct the command list when the input `value` is a dictionary. It should loop through the key-value pairs of the dictionary and construct the command list accordingly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the dictionary values correctly, leading to the incorrect construction of the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and construct the command list by adding the name, property, and value for each pair.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should correctly construct the command list and pass the failing tests.
