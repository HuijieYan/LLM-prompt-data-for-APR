```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change value to val to avoid conflict with the function argument
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed the double quotes around {1}
    return command
```

The cause of the bug is that the original function was incorrectly using the same variable name 'value' within the loop which leads to the value being overwritten with different dictionary elements. Also, unnecessary double quotes were being added around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid conflict with the function argument, and to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
