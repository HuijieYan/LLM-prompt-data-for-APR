Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command line arguments to be passed to Spark submit. However, the function has a few issues that prevent it from working correctly.

1. The function uses the variable name `value` multiple times within the loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.
2. The format of adding items to the `command` list using `'"{0}={1}"'` does not match the format expected by the test code, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should use a different variable name in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter, and the format for adding items to the `command` list should be modified to match the expected format.

The corrected function uses the variable `val` in the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter, and it modifies the format for adding items to the `command` list to match the expected format of `--<prop> <val>`.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
