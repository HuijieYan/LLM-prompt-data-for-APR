The issue appears to stem from the `_dict_arg` function where a dictionary of command-line arguments is improperly being formatted. Specifically, strings within the `value` dictionary are being encapsulated without determining whether it is necessary or affecting the output. 

To fix this issue, in the `_dict_arg` function, if the value for an option is a string that does not require encapsulation, it should be included as-is, otherwise it should be encapsulated.

Here is a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            if isinstance(prop_value, str) and not prop_value.startswith('"') and not prop_value.endswith('"'):
                command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the failing tests should pass.
