The given `buggy` function is a part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class of the buggy `luigi` module. The function is intended to create command arguments based on the input name and value in the form of a dictionary. However, the function incorrectly combines the name and value together.

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect handling of key-value pairs within the input dictionary. The function appends the key and value to the command list instead of constructing key-value pairs correctly. This bug leads to discrepancies in the command arguments during tests, causing the failing test and corresponding assertion error.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should construct key-value pairs properly using the correct string formatting before appending it to the command list. 

Here's a corrected version of the given function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # .. Other methods and class members ..
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            # Construct key-value pairs using string formatting and add to command list
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [f'{name}', f'--{prop}={val}']
        return command
```

In the corrected `_dict_arg` function, key-value pairs are constructed using proper string formatting and are added to the `command` list. This will ensure that the command arguments are constructed correctly and the failing tests are passed.
