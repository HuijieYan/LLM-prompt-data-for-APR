The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value when building the command list. This is causing the failing tests to expect the command list to be constructed without quotes, leading to an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the _dict_arg function will now construct the command list without including quotes around the property and value, which should resolve the failing tests.
