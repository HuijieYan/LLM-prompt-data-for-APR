The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is overwriting the `value` variable with the for loop iteration variable. This causes the `value` attribute to take the value of the last key in the dictionary, resulting in incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the iteration variable within the for loop. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to 'val' for clarity
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
