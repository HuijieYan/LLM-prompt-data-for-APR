The problem arises because the `_dict_arg` function encloses both the key and its value in double quotes. This leads to additional double quotes being added to the command list.

The correct command list format should be without double quotes for the value inside the command list.

The bugs in the `_dict_arg` function can be fixed by updating the way the command list is formed and the string formatting within the loop. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

After making the above correction, the provided tests should pass successfully without any errors.
