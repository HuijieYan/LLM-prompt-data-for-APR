The cause of the bug is the use of unnecessary double quotes around the value when creating the command list. This is reflected in the error message for both test cases, where the comparison fails due to the presence of unnecessary double quotes in the output list.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val to differentiate from the outer value
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```
