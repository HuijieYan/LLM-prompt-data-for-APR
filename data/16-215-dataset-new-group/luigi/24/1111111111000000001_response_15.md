The buggy function `_dict_arg` in class `SparkSubmitTask` is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments, but it has a bug where it only accepts a single dictionary and does not handle nested dictionaries properly.

The bug occurs because the function only checks if the input value is a dictionary, but it does not handle nested dictionaries correctly. When the input value is a dictionary containing nested dictionaries, the function fails to iterate over the nested dictionaries and construct the command list properly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_dict_arg` function to recursively handle nested dictionaries and concatenate the command list for each key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, dict):
                command.extend(self._dict_arg(name, val))
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function can now handle nested dictionaries properly and construct the command list as expected, thus passing the failing test cases.
