The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not handling the key-value pairs in the `value` dictionary correctly. It is not adding the key-value pairs as command line arguments in the correct format.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the items in the `value` dictionary and construct the command list with the correct format for key-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should handle the key-value pairs in the `value` dictionary correctly and return the expected command list.
