The cause of the bug is that the function is adding double quotes around the values of the dictionary items, which is not expected in the input. This is causing the assertion errors in the provided failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the values while constructing the command list. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values.
