## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py
import luigi

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to val to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair
        return command
```

By changing the placeholder variable name to `val` to avoid conflict, and removing the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair in the `command` list, this corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function should fix the bugs identified in the failing test cases. This should ensure that the function returns the expected output values and types for the given input parameters.
