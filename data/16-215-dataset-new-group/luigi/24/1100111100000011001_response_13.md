The issue with the buggy function is that it reuses the variable name "value" in the for loop, which causes the value of the outer "value" parameter to be overwritten. This leads to incorrect values being appended to the command list.

To fix this bug, we should use different variable names for the inner loop to avoid overwriting the outer "value" parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the inner loop uses the variable name "val" instead of "value" to store the value of each property in the dictionary. This ensures that the outer "value" parameter is not overwritten and the expected values are appended to the command list.

This corrected version of the function should satisfy all the provided expected input/output values and types.
