The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it wraps the prop=value pairs in double quotes when adding them to the command list, causing the test to fail because the expected values do not include these quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should not wrap the prop=value pairs in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
