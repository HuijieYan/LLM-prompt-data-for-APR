The buggy function is the `_dict_arg` function, which is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input and return a list. The function iterates through the dictionary and appends key-value pairs to the list in a specific format. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the list that is returned. 

When the function runs, it iterates through the input dictionary and constructs the `command` list by concatenating the `name` with the key-value pairs. However, it does not format the value correctly, which causes it to fail the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the value is enclosed in double quotes and the key-value pair is formatted as `"key=value"`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} \"{prop}={val}\"")
    return command
```

This corrected version formats the key-value pairs in the desired format, enclosed in double quotes, and separated by an equals sign.

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases provided.
