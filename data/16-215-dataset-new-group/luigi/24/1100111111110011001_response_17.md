## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Change the variable name from value to val
    return command
```

After analyzing the code and the failing tests, it seems that the bug is caused by using the same variable name `value` within the loop in the `_dict_arg` function. This causes the inner `value` to overwrite the outer `value`, and results in unexpected behavior when constructing the `command` list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to change the variable names in the loop to avoid overwriting the outer `value`. 

The corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is provided above, with the variable names in the loop changed from `value` to `val`. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in both failing test cases.
