The root cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly handling the dictionary input for the value parameter. It is adding double quotes around the property and value, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values when comparing lists.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes added to the property and value in the command list. This can be achieved by directly appending the property and value without enclosing them in quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # The corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]  # Append property and value without quotes
        return command
```

By updating the `_dict_arg` function as shown above, it should now correctly handle the dictionary input, and the corrected version of the function will pass the failing tests without causing the mismatch in expected and actual values.
