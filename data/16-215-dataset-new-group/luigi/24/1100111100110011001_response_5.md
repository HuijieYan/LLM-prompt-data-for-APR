The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the string formatting in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This formatting adds extra double quotes around the property-value pair, leading to the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes from the formatted string and update the test cases accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly format the property-value pairs without adding extra double quotes.

After applying the fix, the function should pass the failing test cases.
