The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect handling of dictionary items. The bug causes the function to wrap certain items in double quotes when it shouldn't, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual lists.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly adds double quotes around the property value when building the command list. This causes the lists to differ from the expected output and leads to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when building the command list for dictionary items.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now properly build the command list without wrapping dictionary items in unnecessary double quotes. This should make the function pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
