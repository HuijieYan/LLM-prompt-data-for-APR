The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the `command` list. Specifically, it should be adding the key-value pairs with the format `"{key}={value}"` to the `command` list. However, it is not correctly formatting the string. Instead of adding `"{0}={1}"` to the `command` list, it should add `"{0}={1}"` to properly format the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly format the key-value pairs and add them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected function should now properly format the key-value pairs and add them to the `command` list, satisfying the expected input/output values and passing the failing tests.
