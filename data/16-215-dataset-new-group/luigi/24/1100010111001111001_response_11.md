The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary and return a list of command-line arguments. The issue with the current implementation is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. It is also adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, the function should format the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list without adding unnecessary quotes.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs and properly formats the dictionary into the command list. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the given test cases.
