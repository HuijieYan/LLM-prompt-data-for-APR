The bug in the provided function is that it is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property-value pairs when building the command list. This causes the command list to contain incorrect syntax for passing arguments. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotation marks around the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the input/output values for both cases will match the expected values and types provided.
