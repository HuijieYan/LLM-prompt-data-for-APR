The `SparkSubmitTask._dict_arg` method simply returns a list `command` with processed details that can be used as command-line arguments. The method currently creates `name` and `value` parameters, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. The method will process the keys and values into a list of command-line arguments. However, the current implementation appears to have issues with formatting the dictionary item ("Prop=Value").

Based on the failing tests and related errors:

The failing tests indicate that dictionary key-value pairs are not being processed properly by the `_dict_arg` method. The failing assertions point out that the expected command list and the actual command list contain differences that mostly relate to how the dictionary items are being processed and formatted. Specifically, the string values in the dictionary are not properly formatted as command-line arguments.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` method needs to correctly process the dictionary key-value pairs and format them into command-line arguments.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, string format is used instead of f-string ("{0}={1}") to ensure compatibility with quoted args and to avoid escaping issues. When running the failing tests with this corrected version, it should pass all the assertions.
