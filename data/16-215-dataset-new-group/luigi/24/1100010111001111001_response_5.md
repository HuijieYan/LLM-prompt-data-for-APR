The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not properly format the dictionary values into the command list. Instead, it should format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into strings and add them to the command list.

The bug is caused by the function joining the `name` and `"{0}={1}"` strings directly without properly enclosing the values in quotes.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into strings and add them to the command list with quotes around the value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into strings and add them to the command list with quotes around the value, addressing the bug in the original code.
