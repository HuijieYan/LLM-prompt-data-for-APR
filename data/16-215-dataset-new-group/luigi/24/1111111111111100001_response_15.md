## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly formatting the dictionary items as strings with double quotes, causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

In both cases, the `value` parameter is a dictionary. The function is expected to iterate through the dictionary items and append them to the `command` list in the correct format. However, the function incorrectly appends the items with additional double quotes around the property value, resulting in a mismatch with the expected command list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should append the dictionary items to the `command` list without adding additional double quotes around the property value.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val' to avoid confusion with the name 'value'
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed additional double quotes
    return command
```
