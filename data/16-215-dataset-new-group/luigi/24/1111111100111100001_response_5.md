### Analysis
The function `_dict_arg` is intended to generate a list of command-line arguments from a dictionary. The bug appears to be that when the dictionary value is added to the command list, it is being surrounded by double quotes, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is formatting the dictionary value using double quotes, resulting in an incorrect command list. This formatting is unnecessary and causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary value need to be removed so that the command list is generated correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

After making this change, the corrected function should generate the command list without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the failing tests.
