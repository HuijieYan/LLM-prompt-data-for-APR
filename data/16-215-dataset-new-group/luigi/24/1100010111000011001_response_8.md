The issue with the current _dict_arg function is that it is not handling the case where the value is empty or not a dictionary properly. It should be returning an empty list in these cases.

The current function is also using the same variable name "value" for both the input value and the loop variable, which can cause confusion and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we can add a check for an empty or non-dictionary value at the beginning of the function, and return an empty list in those cases. We also need to use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid confusion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if not value or not isinstance(value, dict):
        return command
    
    for prop, val in value.items():
        command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the cases where the value is empty or not a dictionary properly, and also use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid potential errors. This should make the function pass the failing test cases provided.
