The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that the values are being added without quotes around them, causing the output to be different from the expected results. To fix this bug, we need to add double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should output the expected values for the given test cases.
