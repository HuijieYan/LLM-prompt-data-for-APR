The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into the `command` list. 

The bug occurs because the function is not properly adding the dictionary items to the `command` list. It should add each key-value pair in the format `"{prop}={value}"`, but instead it is using `name` for each key and value separately.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate over the dictionary items and format each key-value pair correctly before adding it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should properly format the dictionary items and pass the failing tests.
