The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly generating the command list by not properly handling the dictionary values. It is adding extra quotes around the values, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra quotes around the values when constructing the command list in the _dict_arg function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the _dict_arg function will now correctly generate the command list by formatting the dictionary key-value pairs without adding extra quotes. This will ensure that the expected and actual command lists match, fixing the failing tests.
