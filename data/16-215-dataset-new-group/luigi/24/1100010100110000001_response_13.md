The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that when it constructs the return list `command`, it incorrectly adds the key-value pairs from the dictionary `value` using the format `"{0}={1}"`. This is the cause of the failing test cases with a different assertion error output each time. The bug appears as it wraps the values in double-quotes, causing discrepancies in list comparisons when they contain values adopting this format. 

* It can be fixed by modifying the string formatting in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line to `command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]`. This will remove the erroneous double quotes around the value.

* Also, it's better to avoid using parameters with the same name within the function. To resolve this, the parameter `value` can be renamed to something else to prevent ambiguity with the loop variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, input_dict):
    command = []
    if input_dict and isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        for prop, value in input_dict.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
