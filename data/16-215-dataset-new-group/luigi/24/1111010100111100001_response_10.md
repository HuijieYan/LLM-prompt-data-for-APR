The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is causing the expected dictionary values to be enclosed in double quotes ("") within the resulting command list. This is causing the assertion error in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the value when building the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly create the command list with the expected format, without enclosing the property value in double quotes. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing tests.
