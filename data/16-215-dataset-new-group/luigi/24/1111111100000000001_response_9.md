## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class and related functions

The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. The purpose of the function is to build a command for submitting a Spark job, based on a dictionary of arguments provided as input.

The function seems to iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and constructs a list `command` containing the formatted key-value pairs.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error in the function is the reassignment of the variable `value` inside the for-loop, which overwrites the value passed as an argument to the function.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the related functions

The bug in the function is caused by reusing the variable `value` as the iterator variable in the for-loop:
```
for prop, value in value.items():
```
This reassignment causes the original value passed to the function to be overwritten, leading to incorrect command construction.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the iterator in the for-loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` passed to the function.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use val instead of value
    return command
```
