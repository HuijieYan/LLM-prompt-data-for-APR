The issue arises from the `_dict_arg` method in the SparkSubmitTask class of the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. The method is intended to construct command arguments from a provided name and value, but certain conditions and string formatting within the method might be causing issues.

The primary cause of the bug appears to be the use of string formatting without proper handling for the format string. When constructing command arguments, the method is surrounded by double quotes before being added to the command array. However, the double quotes are not stripped when `value` is already a string or not a dictionary, resulting in incorrect formatting in the commands and causing assertion failures in the test functions.

To fix the issue, the string formatting portion of the method needs to be revised to append the arguments properly, ensuring that the strings are correctly formatted and that unnecessary double quotes are not added to already string-formatted arguments.

Additionally, the method doesn't include proper handling for values that are not dictionaries. This means that if `value` is not a dictionary, the method would still enter the loop and cause errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method which includes the necessary adjustments to address the issues presented:

```python
from abc import ABC
import luigi


def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
  """
  Template task for running a Spark job
  Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
  See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
  for more information
  
  """
  
  def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
      command = []
      if value and isinstance(value, dict):
          for prop, value in value.items():
            if isinstance(value, str):
              command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
            else:
              command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
      return command
```

By making these adjustments, the code should now handle the formatting of the command arguments correctly, ensuring that the test cases provided would pass successfully.
