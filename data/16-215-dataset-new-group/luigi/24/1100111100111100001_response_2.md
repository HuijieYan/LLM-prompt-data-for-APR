The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double-quoting of the property-value pair when constructing the command list. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists when comparing them in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the property-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs, resolving the failing test cases.
