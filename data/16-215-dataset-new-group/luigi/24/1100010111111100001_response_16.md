The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it quotes the values of the dictionary items, which causes the tests to fail. The quoted values should not be in quotes in the return value of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
