The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not handling the case where the value is a dictionary correctly. It should be appending the key-value pairs in the dictionary to the `command` list, but it is not doing so properly.

The issue is that the inner loop variable `value` is getting overwritten in the loop, which causes the incorrect processing of items in the dictionary.

To fix this, the inner loop variable name should be changed to avoid overwriting the outer loop variable. Also, the value should be properly appended to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
