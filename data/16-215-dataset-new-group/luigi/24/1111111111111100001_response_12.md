From the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables right before the buggy function's return, we can see that the bug is caused by the unnecessary double-quoting of the property value when constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double-quoting of the property value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double-quoting around the `{0}={1}` format string, the corrected function will construct the command list without unnecessary double-quoting. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
