The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is creating command strings with unnecessary double quotes around the property values, which is causing the AssertionError in the test cases. 

To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes from around the property values when building the command list in the _dict_arg function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the unnecessary double quotes will not be added to the property values, and the function should now return the correct command list, passing the failing tests.
