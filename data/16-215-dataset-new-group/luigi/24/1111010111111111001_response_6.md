The issue in the _dict_arg function lies in how the values are added to the command list. The "prop=value" pairs are being enclosed in double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this issue, we can modify the _dict_arg function to not enclose the "prop=value" pairs in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will now produce the expected output values and types for the given test cases.
