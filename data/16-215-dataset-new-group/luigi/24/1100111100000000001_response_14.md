There are a couple of potential error locations in the `_dict_arg` function:

1. The variable `value` is being used both as the input parameter and as a loop variable in the for loop. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.
2. The use of `name` as an argument and also in the loop could lead to confusion and potential errors.

The cause of the bug is the reusing of the variable name `value` in the for loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. Additionally, the value of `name` is being used without making it clear if it is a string or if it should be appended as is.

To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable to `prop_value` to avoid conflicts with the input parameter `value`. We can also add some string formatting to make it clear that `name` should be appended directly without any quotes.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
