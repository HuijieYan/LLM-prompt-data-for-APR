    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # remove the quotes from the value variable
        return command
```

The buggy function has a bug in constructing the command list when iterating over the properties of the dictionary. The bug causes the function to include the value in quotes, which creates a mismatch in the expected and actual list of arguments.

In order to fix the bug, the variable within the loop should be named differently from the function parameter to avoid conflict, and the quotes around the value should be removed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
