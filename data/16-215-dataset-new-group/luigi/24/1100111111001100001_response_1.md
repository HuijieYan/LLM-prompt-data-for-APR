The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable that represents the individual values in the dictionary. This causes the function to use the wrong value when creating the command list.

To fix this, we can rename the variable `value` inside the for loop to something else, like `v`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():  # Rename the variable value to v
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]  # Use v instead of value
    return command
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly build the command list and pass the failing tests.
