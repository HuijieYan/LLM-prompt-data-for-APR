The bug in the function is that it incorrectly concatenates the command list. Instead of adding the name and values separately, it combines them inside one string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the command list with the name and value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version properly formats the command list with the name and value pairs, ensuring that it satisfies the expected input/output values for all cases.
