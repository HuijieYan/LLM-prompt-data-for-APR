The cause of the bug:
The `_dict_arg` function is not outputting the correct command based on the input arguments. It's not handling the arguments properly and causing the lists to differ, as each item is not being accurately represented.

Fix strategy:
1. We need to get rid of the double quotation marks around the property and value inside the command list.
2. Directly append the property and value to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
