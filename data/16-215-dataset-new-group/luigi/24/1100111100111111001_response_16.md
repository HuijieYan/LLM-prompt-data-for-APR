The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command parameters. The function is adding quotation marks around the value, which is causing the failing tests.

The issue stems from the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

By adding double quotes around the formatted key-value pair, the function is creating incorrect command parameters for the subprocess.Popen call.

To fix this bug, the function needs to remove the quotation marks from around the formatted key-value pair and only add the key-value pair to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the dictionary key-value pairs into a list of command parameters without unnecessary quotation marks.

By making this change, the function will pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
