## Analyzing the buggy function
The function is supposed to take a dictionary as input and format it into a list of command-line arguments. However, it has a bug that causes it to not handle the dictionary correctly, resulting in an incorrect list of command-line arguments.

## Potential error locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The use of "value" as both the input parameter and the loop variable may cause confusion and result in incorrect behavior.
2. The string formatting may not be done correctly, resulting in malformed command-line arguments.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the misuse of the loop variable name "value" inside the loop that iterates over the dictionary items, leading to incorrect formatting of command-line arguments.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop variable inside the loop and ensure that the string formatting is done correctly to generate the command-line arguments.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
