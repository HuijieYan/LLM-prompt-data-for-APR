Potential issues with the buggy function:
1. The function is taking two parameters both named "value", which could lead to unintended behavior.
2. The function is not correctly creating the command list from the dictionary values provided.

Cause of the bug:
The function is not correctly handling the dictionary values and is not creating the command list as expected, leading to the failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the second "value" parameter in the function to avoid ambiguity.
2. Iterate through the dictionary properly and construct the command list with the correct format.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value_dict):
    command = []
    if value_dict and isinstance(value_dict, dict):
        for prop, value in value_dict.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
