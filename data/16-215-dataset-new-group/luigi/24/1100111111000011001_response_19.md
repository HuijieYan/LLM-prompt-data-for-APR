The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the fact that it reuses the variable name `value` in the for loop, which overwrites the input parameter `value`. This causes the function to use the wrong value and prop in the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct command list as expected in the failing test cases.
