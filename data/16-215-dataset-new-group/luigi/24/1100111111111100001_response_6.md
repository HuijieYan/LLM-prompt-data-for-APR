The issue in the buggy function is that it incorrectly adds quotation marks around the property-value pair in the command list when constructing it. This causes the failing tests to expect different command lists than the ones returned by the function.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks from the command list construction.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Modified to remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By making this change, the function constructs the command list correctly without adding unnecessary quotation marks, and the tests should now pass without any issues.
