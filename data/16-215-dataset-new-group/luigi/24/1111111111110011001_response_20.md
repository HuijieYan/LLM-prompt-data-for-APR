```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name from "value" to "val"
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # change variable name from "value" to "val"
        return command
```

By changing the variable name in the for loop from "value" to "val" and using "val" instead of "value" in the command list, the corrected function will properly construct the command list with the expected format. This should resolve the issues raised in the failing tests.
