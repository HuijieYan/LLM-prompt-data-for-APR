### Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function of the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file contains an error. The error seems to be caused by the way command is being constructed when `value` is a dictionary.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function are:
1. The loop that constructs the `command` list using the `name` and `value` from the input dictionary.

### Cause of the Bug
The error message states that the command lists are different. The error seems to be related to the incorrect construction of the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. The construction of command list doesn't handle the dictionary items correctly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual one.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by properly constructing the command list using the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. The values should not be enclosed in double quotes unless they are being passed as strings. The key-value pairs should be separated by '=' and not '=".

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Ensure that values are concatenated as key=value
    return command
```
