The bug appears to be in the `_dict_arg` function within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` file. The function is intended to convert a dictionary argument into a valid command list, but it seems to have issues when processing the provided dictionary.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function processes the dictionary argument and constructs the command list. It seems to be encountering issues when iterating through the provided dictionary and constructing the command list, resulting in an incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly process the dictionary argument and construct the command list according to the test cases provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name than value to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Update the formatting to remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly process the dictionary argument and construct the command list, resolving the bug. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
