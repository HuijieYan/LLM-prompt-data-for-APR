The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the incorrect formatting of the key-value pairs of the input dictionary `value`. The current implementation adds an extra pair of quotes around the value, which causes the tests to fail due to the mismatch in the expected and actual command lists.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the extra quotes around the value in the key-value pair when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the extra quotes around {1}
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without adding extra quotes around the values, and the failing tests should pass.
