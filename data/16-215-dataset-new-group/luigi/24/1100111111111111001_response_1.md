The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the construction of the command list when handling dictionary values. The function is incorrectly adding quotes around the property-value pairs, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding quotes around the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs, resolving the mismatch and passing the failing tests.
