The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs to be added to the `command` list. The function is supposed to create a list of command-line arguments based on the dictionary `value` provided.

The issue is that the function is enclosing the property-value pairs in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected and actual command lists.

To fix this bug, the function should remove the double quotes around the property-value pairs and add the property and value directly to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Add property and value directly without quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
