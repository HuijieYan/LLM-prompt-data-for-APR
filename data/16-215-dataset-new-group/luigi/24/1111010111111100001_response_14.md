The bug seems to be with the _dict_arg function in the SparkSubmitTask class. The function is not handling the dictionary input correctly, resulting in incorrect command list generation. The failing tests indicate that the function is not formatting the dictionary values correctly, leading to assertion errors.

The cause of the bug is that the function is wrapping the property and value in double quotes, resulting in incorrect formatting of the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the value is a dictionary and format the property and value without quotes before appending it to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle dictionary inputs correctly and format the command list as expected, passing the failing test cases.
