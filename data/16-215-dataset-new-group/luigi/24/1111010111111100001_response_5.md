The issue with the `_dict_arg` function arises from the fact that it is enclosing the property and value within double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail. The addition of unnecessary double quotes is the root cause of the issue.

To fix the bug, you should remove the double quotes around the property and value when adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By applying this change, the function should now correctly format the property and value pairs without enclosing them in unnecessary double quotes. This will address the issue with the failing test cases.

Please replace the original `_dict_arg` function with the corrected version provided above, and the failing test cases should now pass.
