The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the fact that it is adding the `name` and `value` as separate strings to the `command` list, including double quotes around the value. This is not consistent with the format expected in the failing tests. Additionally, in the second test case, the quotes around the value are not expected.

To fix this bug, we need to change how the `name` and `value` pairs are added to the `command` list. We also need to handle the case when the `value` is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function will now correctly build the `command` list without including unnecessary quotes around the value. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
