## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command parts to be used with a subprocess call. It should iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and add them to the `command` list.

The error messages indicate that the function is not handling the dictionary values correctly, specifically when building the command list.

In the first case, the function is adding an extra set of quotes around the value of the property, resulting in a mismatch when comparing lists.

In the second case, the function is incorrectly wrapping the value portion in quotes when building the command list, causing a mismatch when comparing lists.

## Bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the dictionary values when building the command list. The function is adding additional quotes around the property value when it should just add the property name and value as separate elements in the list.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for building the command list to correctly handle the dictionary values and create the command list without extra quotes around property values.

## The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}'.format(prop), str(val)]
    return command
```
