The issue in the buggy function is that when adding key-value pairs to the `command` list, the value is being wrapped in double quotes even if it is already a string. This is causing the output list to contain elements with unnecessary quotes, leading to the assertion errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check the type of the value and only wrap it in quotes if it is not a string. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will append the key-value pairs to the `command` list without adding unnecessary quotes, ensuring that the output matches the expected values.
