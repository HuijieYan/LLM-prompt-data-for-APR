## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to take a name and a value, and if the value is a dictionary, it should construct a command list with each key-value pair from the dictionary formatted as `"name='key=value'"`. However, the current implementation has a potential error at the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` where `prop` and `value` are being used as variable names which could cause confusion. 

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the reassignment of variable names `prop` and `value` within the for loop. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect construction of the command list. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variables inside the for loop to avoid shadowing the function arguments. 

## Updated Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
