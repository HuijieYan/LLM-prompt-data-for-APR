The problem with the buggy function is that it is not generating the command list correctly. The key-value pairs from the input dictionary are not being formatted properly, resulting in incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through the input dictionary and format the key-value pairs as strings before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now generate the command list correctly for the given input dictionary, producing the expected output for the failing test cases.
