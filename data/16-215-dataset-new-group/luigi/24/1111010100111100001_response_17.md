The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is incorrectly formatting the command list when creating arguments for a Spark job. It is adding quotes around the property values, which is not the correct format for Spark command-line arguments.

To fix the bug, we should remove the quotes around the property values in the command list created by the _dict_arg function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around the property values, the function will generate the correct command list for the Spark job.

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list for the Spark job and the failing tests should pass.
