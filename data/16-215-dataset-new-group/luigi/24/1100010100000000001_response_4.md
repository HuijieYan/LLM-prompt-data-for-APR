The buggy function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command line arguments. However, there are potential errors in the function:
1. The variable "value" is being used to iterate through the dictionary and also as a condition in the "if" statement, which could cause unintended behavior.
2. The format used to create the command string may not be correct, resulting in incorrect command line arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is reusing the variable "value" for two different purposes: as the input value and as the loop variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid conflicts with the input value. Additionally, the format for creating the command string should be revised to ensure the correct format for command line arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name}='{key}={val}'")
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we use "key" and "val" as the loop variables to avoid conflicts with the input value. We also use the correct format to create the command string using f-strings for better readability.
