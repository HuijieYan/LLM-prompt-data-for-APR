The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not correctly adding the properties and values to the `command` list. The problem arises from the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where it adds the property and value pair as a single string inside double quotes. But, in the test cases, the value should not be enclosed in quotes.

To fix the bug, the function should add the property and value pair as two separate strings without double quotes.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, prop, val])
    return command
```

By modifying the `_dict_arg` function as provided above and removing the unnecessary double quotes from the property and value pair in the command line list, it should fix the bug. This fixed version should now pass the failing test cases.
