The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. The function should be formatting the key-value pairs as strings and then adding them to the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs and add them to the command list as specified in the expected values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append(f'"{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
