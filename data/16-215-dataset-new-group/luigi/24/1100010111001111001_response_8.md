The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the construction of the `command` list. The problem is with the formatting of the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list. Instead of adding the pairs as `"key=value"`, it is adding them as `"'key=value'"`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the formatting of the key-value pairs when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs as `"key=value"` and will pass the failing tests.
