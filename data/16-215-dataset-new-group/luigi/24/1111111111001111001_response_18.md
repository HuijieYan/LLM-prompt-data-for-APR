The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into strings for the command list. The buggy implementation is not including quotes around the key-value pairs, which is causing the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly formatting the dictionary into a list of command arguments. It should be adding the key-value pairs with quotes around the value. This is evident from the failing tests and the runtime input/output variable values.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should iterate through the dictionary and format each key-value pair with quotes around the value before adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the dictionary key-value pairs and pass the failing tests.
