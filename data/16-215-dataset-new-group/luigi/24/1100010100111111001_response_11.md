The buggy function is intended to convert a dictionary of key-value pairs into a list of command arguments. The problem with the current implementation is that it is adding unnecessary quotations around the values when creating the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding extra quotes around the property-value pairs, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to not include the extra quotes when creating the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will generate the command list without additional quotes around the property-value pairs. This should resolve the issues with the failing test cases.
