## Correction:

The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values when building the `command` list. The values for the dictionary properties are being enclosed in double quotes when they should not be. This incorrect formatting is causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the `_dict_arg` function should be modified to correctly build the `command` list without enclosing the dictionary values in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the failing tests should pass.
