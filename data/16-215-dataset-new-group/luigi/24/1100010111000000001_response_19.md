The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary argument by parsing it and building a command list. However, there are several potential error locations in the function that could lead to the failing test:
1. The `name` variable is appended to the `command` list in each iteration of the loop. It should only be appended once outside the loop.
2. The string formatting in `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` should not have double quotes around `{0}={1}` as it is adding unnecessary quotes to the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding the `name` repeatedly instead of adding it only once, and it is adding quotes where they are not needed.

To fix the bug, we should refactor the function to handle the `name` variable and string formatting more accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With these changes, the function should properly build the command list from the dictionary input.

Running the failing test with this corrected function should now pass.
