The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to handle a dictionary input and construct a command list based on the key-value pairs of the dictionary. However, the bug occurs when the function incorrectly formats the key-value pairs.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, which leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output command list.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
With this corrected version, the function should construct the command list without adding double quotes around the key-value pairs, ensuring that the command list matches the expected output.
