## Analysis:
The buggy function _dict_arg takes in a name and a value, and then processes the value to create a command list.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function uses the variable name for both the argument name and the loop variable name, which could lead to confusion and potential bugs.
2. The formatting of the command list may not be correct, as the use of double quotes around the {0}={1} could result in an incorrect command.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function has a potential bug due to reusing the variable name and improper formatting of the command list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different variable for the loop variable in the for loop to avoid confusion with the argument name.
2. Modify the command list formatting to ensure it is correct for generating the command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable for the loop
            command += [f"{name} {prop}={val}"]  # Modify the command list formatting
    return command
```
