Based on the failed test cases and the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the way the _dict_arg function processes the dictionary values.

Upon analyzing the failing test and the runtime values, it's clear that the issue stems from the "value" variable being enclosed in double quotes when it's added to the command list. This unexpected behavior causes the failing tests.

The strategy to fix this bug is to modify the _dict_arg function to correctly handle the dictionary values without enclosing them in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly form the command list without enclosing the dictionary values in double quotes, which should resolve the failing test cases.
