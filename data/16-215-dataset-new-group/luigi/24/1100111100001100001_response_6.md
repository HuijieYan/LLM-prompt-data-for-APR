The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using the same variable name `value` to iterate through the dictionary and also store the inner value, this causes the inner value of the dictionary to override the outer value. 

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable to iterate through the dictionary. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
