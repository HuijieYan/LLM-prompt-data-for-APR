## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' to avoid overwriting
                command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed format to '--{0}={1}' and removed unnecessary quotes
        return command
```

Explanation:
1. The original function used double quotes around the property-value pair, which would cause issues with parsing the command. This has been changed to use the correct format of '--{0}={1}' without quotes.
2. Changed the variable name from 'value' to 'val' in the for loop to avoid overwriting the function's input parameter 'value'.
3. The correction ensures that the command list is constructed correctly with the expected format and values for each property.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
