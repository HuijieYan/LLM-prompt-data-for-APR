The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs of the input dictionary into the command list. The function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This revised function should correctly construct the command list with the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
