The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function does not correctly concatenate the arguments for the command list. Instead of constructing the command arguments list, it ends up with double quotes and wrong formatting for dictionary arguments. 

To fix the bug, we have to iterate through the value items of the dictionary and properly concatenate the command arguments for the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By fixing the concatenation, the corrected version of the _dict_arg function will pass the failing test.
