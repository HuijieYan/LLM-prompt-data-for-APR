The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the unnecessary double-quoting of key-value pairs in the command list when building it with the `name` parameter and the dictionary `value`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line to remove the unnecessary quotation marks. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
