Based on the provided information, the buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and a value as input, where the value is expected to be a dictionary. It then iterates through the dictionary and appends the key-value pairs to a command list in a specific format.

The issue with the current implementation of the function is that it encloses the property and value in double quotes when appending to the command list, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should append the key-value pairs without enclosing them in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the key-value pairs from the dictionary are appended to the command list without being enclosed in double quotes, which should resolve the discrepancy and make the function pass the failing test cases.
