The problem with the code is that it allows the input values to be wrapped with extra quotes. This will cause the test to fail because it is not expecting the extra quotes. 

To fix the bug, the implementation of _dict_arg can be changed to remove the double quotes around the value whenever it appends it to the command list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
