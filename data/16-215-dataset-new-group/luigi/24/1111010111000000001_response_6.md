The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` luigi class seems to have a bug in the way it constructs the `command` list based on the `value` dictionary passed.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The `command` list doesn't seem to be concatenated correctly with the arguments.
2. There may be an issue with how the dictionary items are being processed within the loop.

The cause of the bug could be that the function is not handling the dictionary values correctly, possibly due to incorrect formatting, which is leading to test failures.

To fix this bug, a strategy could be to iterate through the dictionary items and construct the command list using a proper key-value pair formatting. Additionally, it's important to handle the case where the value is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the `command` list is extended properly with the key-value pairs from the dictionary, and the formatting of the key-value pairs is handled correctly. This should address the bug and make the function more robust.
