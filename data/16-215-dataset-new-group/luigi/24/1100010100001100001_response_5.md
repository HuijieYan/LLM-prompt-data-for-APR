The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable used in the for loop with a different value. This causes the function to use the wrong value in the loop and results in incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, the variable used in the for loop needs to be different from the input parameter `value`. This can be achieved by using a different variable name in the for loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change 'value' to 'val' to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
