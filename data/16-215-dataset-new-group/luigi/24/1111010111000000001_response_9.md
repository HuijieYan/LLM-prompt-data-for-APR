The buggy function `_dict_arg` is likely intended to construct a list of command-line arguments to be passed to a subprocess when running a Spark job. However, the function has a bug that causes it to return an empty list in certain cases, which is likely causing the failing tests.

The bug occurs because the function iterates over the elements of the `value` dictionary and appends formatted strings to the `command` list, but the `value` variable is also used as the loop variable, leading to it being overridden. Additionally, the condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` should be modified to `if isinstance(value, dict) and value:` to handle the case when `value` is an empty dictionary.

To fix the bug, the following corrected version of the function is provided:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict) and value:
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the loop variable to 'val' to avoid overriding 'value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the loop variable inside the `for` loop is changed to `val` to avoid overriding the `value` variable, and the condition is also modified to `if isinstance(value, dict) and value:`. This should address the bug and make the function behave as intended, passing the failing tests.
