The issue in the provided function is that it incorrectly includes the property name and value inside double quotes in the `command` list when looping through the dictionary passed as the `value` parameter. This is causing the test failures as the expected and actual command lists do not match.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the double quotes from the string formatting inside the loop in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming value to val to prevent variable name conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removing double quotes from string formatting
    return command
```

With this fixed version, the `command` list will be correctly populated without unnecessary double quotes, and the function should pass the failing tests.
