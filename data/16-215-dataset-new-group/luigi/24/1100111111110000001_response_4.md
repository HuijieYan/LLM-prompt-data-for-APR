The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function modifies the 'name' and 'value' parameters internal to the function. This causes the subsequent command to contain the incorrect parameter, resulting in the failing test. The failing test fails with the "AssertionError" message, indicating a mismatch in expected and actual output.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to avoid modifying the 'name' and 'value' parameters directly inside the _dict_arg function. Instead, create a local variable to store the intermediate command and return its value. Additionally, remove the unwanted quotes from the values in the command assembly.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Avoid using the same name as the outer parameter
            command += [name, prop + "=" + str(val)]  # Concatenate without quotes
    return command
```
