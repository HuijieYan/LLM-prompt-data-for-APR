The issue with the buggy function is that it is erroneously adding double quotes around the property values when creating the command list. This results in the incorrect comparison with the expected output in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when building the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
