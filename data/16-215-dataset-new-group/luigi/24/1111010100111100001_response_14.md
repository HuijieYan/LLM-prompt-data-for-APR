The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary double-quoting of the property-value pairs being added to the `command` list. The unnecessary double-quoting leads to the test cases failing because the expected command lists do not match the actual command lists due to the difference in the formatting.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double-quoting should be removed when appending the property-value pairs to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the property-value pairs will be added to the `command` list without unnecessary double-quoting, and the test cases should pass.
