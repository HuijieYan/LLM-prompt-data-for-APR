The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not correctly formatting the command list when the value is a dictionary. It is adding the key-value pairs directly to the `command` list, but it should be adding them as a single string in the format `"key=value"`.

To fix the bug, we need to change how the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the buggy function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
