The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly formatting the command list when building it from the input dictionary. The bug is causing the values to be enclosed in double quotes and to have an additional `=` character, which is not expected.

The buggy function `_dict_arg` incorrectly constructs the `command` list by enclosing the property and value in double quotes and adding an equal sign. This is not the expected format for the command list.

To fix the bug, the function should modify the construction of the `command` list to remove the double quotes and equal sign when appending the property and value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + val]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly build the `command` list without enclosing the property and value in double quotes and without adding an extra equal sign.

This correction will address the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass.
