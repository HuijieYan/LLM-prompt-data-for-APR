## Analysis
The function is supposed to take a name and a dictionary as input, and then construct a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

## Identified potential error
The use of the variable name shadowing the function parameter name is causing the issue. The variable 'value' is being used in both the function parameter and the for loop.

## Bug cause
The variable 'value' is being overwritten in the for loop, causing the function to return an incorrect command list.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
Change the name of the variable in the for loop to avoid overwriting the function parameter.

## Corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
