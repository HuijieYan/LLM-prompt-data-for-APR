The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary values as strings within a list. The expected behavior is to have the dictionary key-value pairs formatted as strings within a list with the given name. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the dictionary values as strings within a list with the given name.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change value to val to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Change value to val
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the dictionary values as strings within a list. This should ensure that the failing tests pass with the expected input/output values.
