The cause of the bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly adds quotation marks to the values in the dictionary when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotation marks from the values when constructing the command list. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected command lists and pass the failing tests.
