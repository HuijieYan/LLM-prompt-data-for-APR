The bug in the _dict_arg function is related to the way it constructs the command list. It is not handling the dictionary values correctly, leading to a mismatch between the actual and expected output.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list, which is not expected in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle dictionary values without adding double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs when constructing the command list, which aligns with the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
