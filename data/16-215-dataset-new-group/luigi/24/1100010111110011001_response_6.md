The problem in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it is wrapping the values of the dictionary in double quotes, which is causing the test to fail. The expected output values do not have the values within double quotes.

To fix this, the function should not wrap the values with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass both failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
