The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that the values are not being properly formatted when creating the `command` list. The values should be enclosed in double quotes, and the key-value pair should be joined with an equal sign.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the values and append them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly format the values and pass the failing tests.
