The issue in the buggy code is that the values from the dictionary are being enclosed in double quotes for each key-value pair in the command list. However, this is causing a mismatch in the expected and actual values during the test, leading to assertion errors.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly formatting the values from the dictionary by enclosing them in double quotes, which is not expected according to the test cases.

To fix this, we should remove the double quotes around the values when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name to avoid reassignment
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # remove double quotes around val
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for both test cases.
