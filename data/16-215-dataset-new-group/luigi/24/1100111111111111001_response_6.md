The issue with the buggy function is that it creates the command list by concatenating the name and value using string formatting. This causes the values to be enclosed in quotes, which is not expected. Additionally, the function fails to handle the case when the value is not a dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function should concatenate the name and value without enclosing the value in quotes. Also, it should handle the case when the value is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
