3. The code contains a function that causes issues with an assertion failure.
4. We can correct the issue by identifying the error in the `def _dict_arg(self, name, value)` method and correcting it.

### The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--conf', '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
