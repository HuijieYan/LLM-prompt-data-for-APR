The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it improperly adds quotation marks around the key-value pairs in the command list. This results in the values being treated as separate arguments instead of key-value pairs. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks and format the key-value pairs correctly before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format the key-value pairs and add them to the `command` list without unnecessary quotation marks. This should satisfy the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
