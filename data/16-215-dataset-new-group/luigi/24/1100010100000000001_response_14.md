Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function is using the variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable, which can cause confusion and potential errors.
2. The use of string formatting with double quotes around the values may lead to incorrect formatting of the command.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is that it is incorrectly formatting the command by adding double quotes around the key-value pairs within the dictionary, which may not be the desired behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the loop variable name from "value" to something else to avoid confusion with the input parameter "value".
2. Remove the double quotes around the "{0}={1}" format string to correctly format the command.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
