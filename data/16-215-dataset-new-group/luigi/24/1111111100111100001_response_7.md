The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the way it handles the generation of the command list for dictionary arguments. The function incorrectly encloses the property-value pair in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch when comparing the expected command list with the actual command list in the failing test cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_dict_arg` function to generate the command list without enclosing the property-value pair in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly generate the command list for dictionary arguments without enclosing the property-value pair in double quotes, resolving the comparison mismatch in the failing test cases.
