The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is generating a list of command arguments incorrectly. It is adding double quotes around the property and value in the command list which is causing the assertion error. The test case expects the property and value in the command list without double quotes.

I would suggest modifying the _dict_arg function to remove the double quotes around the property and value in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will pass both the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
