## Analysis
The function is supposed to take a name and a dictionary of values, then create a list command where each key-value pair in the dictionary is formatted as a string and added to the command list. However, the function is not currently working as intended.

## Error locations
1. The variable `value` is used as both the input parameter and as a loop variable, which can cause unexpected behavior.
2. The string formatting in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` may not be adding the values correctly to the command list.

## Bug explanation
The bug occurs because the loop variable `value` is overwriting the input parameter `value`. This prevents the function from correctly processing the input dictionary and generating the expected command list.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the input parameter. Additionally, we can modify the formatting of the string in the loop to ensure that the key-value pairs are added correctly to the command list.

## The corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
