The buggy function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the file `luigi/contrib/spark.py`. The function is supposed to create a command for submitting a Spark job based on a dictionary of arguments.

The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner loop variable `value` has the same name as the function argument, causing a conflict and potential overwrite of the function argument.

The cause of the bug is that the inner loop variable `value` overwrites the function argument `value` due to having the same name. This results in incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, the inner loop variable name should be changed to something else to avoid overwriting the function argument. Additionally, the function should be updated to properly generate the command for submitting a Spark job based on the dictionary of arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the inner loop variable has been changed to `val` to avoid the conflict with the function argument `value`. Additionally, the command generation logic has been updated to correctly append the elements to the `command` list.
