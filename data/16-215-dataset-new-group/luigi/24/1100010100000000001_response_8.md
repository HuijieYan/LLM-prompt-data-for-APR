## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # use different variable name to avoid overwriting value
            command.append(f'{name}={prop}={val}')  # change formatting to remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

## Analysis
The buggy function is intended to take a dictionary and format it into a list of strings in the format "name=property=value". However, there are several potential error locations within the function. 

## Potential Errors
1. The use of the variable `value` as both a function argument and within the for loop could lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.
2. The use of `"{0}={1}"` for formatting adds unnecessary quotes around the property and value.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the original function is caused by using the same variable name `value` for both the input argument and the loop variable. This overwrites the original `value` and leads to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, use a different variable name within the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `value`. Additionally, modify the formatting to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property and value.

The corrected version of the function addresses these issues by using a different variable name in the loop (`val`), and using a different formatting syntax to remove the unnecessary quotes.
