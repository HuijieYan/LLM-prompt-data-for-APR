Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function may not be correctly formatting the command list.
2. It is possible that the function is not correctly filtering or formatting the dictionary key-value pairs.

Explanation of the bug:
The function `_dict_arg` does not correctly handle the dictionary value passed to it, leading to an assertion error when the test is executed. The buggy function attempts to build a command list based on the key-value pairs of the dictionary parameter, which may be causing issues in formatting or handling certain values.

Bug-fixing strategy:
- To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the dictionary input and generate the appropriate command list without causing formatting issues.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Fixed variable name to avoid naming conflict
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Adjusted string formatting for command list
    return command
```
