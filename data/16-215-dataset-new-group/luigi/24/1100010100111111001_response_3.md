## The fixed version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
The cause of the bug in the original function is that the values in the dictionary were being enclosed in double quotes even when unnecessary. This resulted in a mismatch between the expected and actual output lists.

To fix the bug, I modified the function to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs.

The corrected version of the function is provided above. This version should address the bug and pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values.
