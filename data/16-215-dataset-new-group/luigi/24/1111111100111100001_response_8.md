The problem is that the `_dict_arg` function is adding quotes around the values of the dictionary when constructing the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the quotes around the values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now construct the command list without adding quotes around the values, resolving the failure in the tests.
