Based on the provided information, it appears that the buggy function is not properly formatting the dictionary values into a list of command arguments, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the buggy function is not handling the dictionary values correctly and is not converting them to the expected format for command arguments.

To fix the bug, the function should properly iterate over the dictionary values and generate the command arguments using the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'prop_value' to avoid variable name conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]  # Corrected the format for command arguments
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should format the dictionary values into the correct list of command arguments as expected, passing the failing tests.
