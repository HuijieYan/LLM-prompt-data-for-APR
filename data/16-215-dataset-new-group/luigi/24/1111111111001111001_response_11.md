The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly formats the key-value pairs from the input dictionary and creates the `command` list. It should enclose the key-value pairs in double quotes and use an equal sign between the key and value.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the `_dict_arg` function to format the key-value pairs correctly and enclose them in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the `_dict_arg` function will properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary and create the `command` list, which matches the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution.
