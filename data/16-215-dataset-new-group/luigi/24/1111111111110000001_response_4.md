The main problem with the buggy function is the implementation of the `_dict_arg` method within the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The current implementation of `_dict_arg` is causing issues with the data formatting and is returning a different structure than expected.

Looking at the failing test cases and the provided error messages, it can be seen that the reason for the failure is the mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list generated by the `SparkSubmitTask` class.

The failure message clearly states the "assertionError" and shows that an element in the expected and actual lists is different while checking the call_args.

To fix the issue, we will need to modify the `_dict_arg` method in the `SparkSubmitTask` class to accurately generate the command list based on the input dictionary.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method that will solve the issues:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ...
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Modified line
        return command
```

After applying the fixes, both of the failing test functions should now pass. The changes made to the `_dict_arg` method includes using `--key=value` format for arguments in the command list, addressing the cause of the failures.
