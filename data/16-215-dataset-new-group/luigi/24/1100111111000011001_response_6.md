The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it reassigns the variable "value" within the for loop, causing it to lose its original value. This leads to incorrect values being appended to the "command" list.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name inside the for loop, so that it doesn't overwrite the original "value" parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Change the variable name inside the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
