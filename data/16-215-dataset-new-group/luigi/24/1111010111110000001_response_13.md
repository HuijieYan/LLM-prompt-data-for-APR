The main issue of the function `_dict_arg` is that some elements are added as separate strings, and some are not. For example, for a dictionary value `{'name': 'value'}`, this method should add `-Dname=value` to the command list, but it adds only `name` and `"value"`. Moreover, it adds `"name=value"` instead of `name=value`, which is the wrong format for command line arguments.

The function iterates through a dictionary, and if the value meets certain criteria, it adds specific items to a command list. There are several issues in the implementation:
1. The function should be careful about different types of data, e.g., not adding empty values to the command list and handling variations in the dictionary values.
2. It should also format the added items based on the command line argument rules.

Considering the details from the failing test case output, the cause of the bug lies in the formatting of the command. Some values are enclosed in quotes whereas they should not be, and other values are missing underscores and equal signs. In Python, the `quote` argument is used when building command lines for system commands. 

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` logic needs to be updated as follows:

1. Check if the dictionary value and name are not empty and are of the right type.
2. Add each property with its value to the command list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                if val:  # Check if the value is existing
                    command.append(name)
                    command.append(prop + '=' + str(val))  # Add the property and its value to the command
        return command
```
