The bug in the _dict_arg function is caused by the unnecessary double quotes around the values in the command list when creating the command. This causes the assertEqual calls in the test functions to fail.

To fix the bug, the double quotes should be removed from the format string in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
