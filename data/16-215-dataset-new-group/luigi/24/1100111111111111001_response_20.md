The issue in the buggy function is that it is not properly formatting the command list when the input `value` is a dictionary. It should be formatting the values in the dictionary as `key=value` pairs, but it is not doing so correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is using double quotes around the formatted `{prop}={value}` string, causing the assertion error in the test cases. The correct formatting should not include double quotes around the value.

To fix the bug, the function should format the `{prop}={value}` string without the double quotes.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
