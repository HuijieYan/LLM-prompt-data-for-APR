Potential Error:
The function `_dict_arg` has a potential error in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The `name` and `value` should not be concatenated together into a single string as it would produce unexpected results.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the test cases to fail as it is not generating the correct commands for the spark job. The incorrect concatenation of `name` and `"prop=value"` is causing the failure in generating the command.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should create a list where the elements are separated properly with the `name` as the first element and `"prop=value"` as the other element.

Corrected Version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # separate name and value properly
    return command
```
