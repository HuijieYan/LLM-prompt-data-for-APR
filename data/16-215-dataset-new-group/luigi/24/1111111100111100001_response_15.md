The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary use of double quotes when adding the property-value pair to the command list, which is resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test cases.

The strategy to fix the bug is to remove the double quotes around the property-value pair when adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes and uses the `format` method to create the property-value pair with the correct format.

With this modification, the function should pass the failing test cases.
