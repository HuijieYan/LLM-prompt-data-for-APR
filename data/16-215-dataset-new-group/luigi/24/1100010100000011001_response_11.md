## Analysis
The function is intended to take a name and a dictionary as input, iterate over the dictionary items, and add them to the `command` list in a specific format. The bug seems to be related to overwriting the `value` variable inside the loop, which leads to incorrect formatting of the command.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the variable name collision between the parameter `value` and the loop variable `value`. When `value` is overwritten inside the loop, it causes unexpected behavior and incorrect formatting of the `command`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to rename the loop variable `value` to something else, so it does not overwrite the function parameter. We can also simplify the code to directly append the formatted string to the `command` list instead of creating a temporary list and then concatenating it.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed loop variable value to val
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))  # Simplified appending to command list
    return command
```
