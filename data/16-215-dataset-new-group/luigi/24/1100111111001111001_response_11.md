The issue seems to be with the construction of the command list in the `_dict_arg` function. The function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the formatting of the key-value pairs from the input dictionary when constructing the command list. It is missing the quotation marks around the key-value pairs in the command list.

To fix the bug, we should add quotation marks around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list, and the failing tests should pass.
