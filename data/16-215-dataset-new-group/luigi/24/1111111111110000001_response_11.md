The "command" list for the "SparkSubmitTask._dict_arg()" function is missing the --conf value in the arguments causing the tests to fail. The argument for value in the command list should not be put in quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the "SparkSubmitTask._dict_arg()" function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

After making these changes, the function should pass the failing tests.
