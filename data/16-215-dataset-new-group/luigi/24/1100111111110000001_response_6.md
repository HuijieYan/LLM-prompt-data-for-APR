Here's the corrected and fixed version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # fixing the variable name to be val; avoid shadowing 'value'
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes around the formatted value
    return command
```

### Explanation
The cause of the bug was that the `_dict_arg` function had an issue with generating the `command` list. While constructing the command list, it was adding double quotes around the formatted value part, which was causing the `proc.call_args[0][0]` not to match with the expected list in the tests. This was leading to an AssertionError in the failing test. 

To fix the bug, the double quotes around the formatted value in the `command` list were removed since the test expected the values without double quotes.

After making the modifications above, now the function should work properly and pass the failing test cases without any issues.
