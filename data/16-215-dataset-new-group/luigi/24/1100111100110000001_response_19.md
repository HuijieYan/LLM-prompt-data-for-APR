## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is taking in `name` and `value` parameters and iterating over the items of the dictionary `value`. It's trying to create a command list by appending the `name` and formatted `prop` and `value`.

### Identify Potential Error
The potential error might be that it's formatting the command incorrectly when the type of `value` is a dictionary.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the `_dict_arg` function as it is not handling and formatting dictionary values correctly.

### Suggested Strategy
The strategy for fixing the bug would be to correctly format the `prop` and `value` as a single string in the command list and not enclosing `value` in double quotes when adding to the command list.


## The corrected version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
