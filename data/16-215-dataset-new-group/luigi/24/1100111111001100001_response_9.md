The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it reuses the variable name `value` in the loop, which overwrites the input parameter `value` of the function. This causes the loop to use the inner `value` instead of the original `value` passed to the function. To fix this, we can rename the inner variable to something else to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use val instead of value
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly construct the command list using the input `value` dictionary. This should address the issue and make the failing tests pass.
