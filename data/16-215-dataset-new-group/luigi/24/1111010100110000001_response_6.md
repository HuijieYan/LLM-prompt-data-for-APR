## Analysis
The function `_dict_arg` seems to be taking `name` and `value` as parameters. It's supposed to check if the `value` is a dictionary, update the `command` list and return `command`. The error messages suggest that there is a difference in formatting the dictionary items.

## Error Location
The potential error location is in the for loop where the function iterates through the dictionary and appends items to the `command` list.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the fact that the function is adding an extra set of double quotes around the dictionary values when constructing the command list. This mismatch in formatting is causing the test cases to fail.

## Potential Fix
The potential fix can be to only consider the values directly without adding extra quotes to them.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fix: removed extra quotes
    return command
``` 
By removing the additional double quotes when constructing the command list, this corrected version should resolve the bug.
