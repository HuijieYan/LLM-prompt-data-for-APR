The issue with the current implementation is that it incorrectly adds quotation marks around the property and value when building the command list. This causes the assertion to fail because the expected and actual command lists do not match due to the difference in quotation marks.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks from the command list.

Let's correct the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name to avoid naming conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove quotation marks
    return command
```

By making this change, we will eliminate the unnecessary quotation marks around the property and value, ensuring that the command list matches the expected output in the test cases.
