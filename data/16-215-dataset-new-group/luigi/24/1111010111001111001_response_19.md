The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary values. It is missing double quotes around the key-value pairs and an equal sign between the key and value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the dictionary values with double quotes and an equal sign between the key and value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the dictionary values, and the failing test cases should pass.
