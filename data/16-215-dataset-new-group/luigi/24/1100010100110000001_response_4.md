The cause of the problem is that the _dict_arg function is adding double quotes around the value while generating the command list. This is causing the assertion to fail since the expected result does not contain double quotes around the values.

The fix for this bug would be to remove the double quotes when adding the value to the command list inside the for loop.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes while generating the command list, the function produces the correct command without any unnecessary characters, fixing the bug and ensuring the function passes the failing test.
