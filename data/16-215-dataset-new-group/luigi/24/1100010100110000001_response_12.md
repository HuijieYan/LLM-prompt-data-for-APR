The issue with the function `_dict_arg` is that it's returning a list with elements that are not in a consistent format. The error messages suggest that there is a disagreement over whether the `--conf` argument should take input in the form of `"Prop=Value"` or `Prop=Value`.

The cause of the bug is the inconsistent formatting of the values for `--conf`, in the test cases, they are being extended in the format `"prop1=val1"` but the function `_dict_arg` generates them in the format `prop1=val`. 

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to generate the values consistently in the format `prop=value`. Additionally, there is no need to put the `prop=value` arguments in double quotes, as they are unnecessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)])
    return command
```

This will generate the arguments for `--conf` in the consistent format `prop=value`, which will resolve the disagreements and remove the unnecessary double quotes. After applying this fix, the corrected version of the function will allow the tests to pass successfully.
