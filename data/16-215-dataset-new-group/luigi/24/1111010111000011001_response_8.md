    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

The buggy function is failing because it incorrectly uses the variable name "value" to iterate through the dictionary items, which leads to confusion with the value parameter passed to the function.

In the first failing test case, the expected output for the `command` variable is `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`, with `value` as `'Value'` and `prop` as `'Prop'`.

In the second failing test case, the expected output for the `command` variable is `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`, with `value` as `'val1'` and `prop` as `'prop1'`.

To fix the bug, the variable names inside the for loop should be changed from `value` to `val` to avoid confusion with the parameter name.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```
