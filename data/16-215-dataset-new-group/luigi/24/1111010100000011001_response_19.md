The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable `value` is being used for different purposes, causing the inner `value` to replace the outer `value` within the loop. Additionally, unnecessary double quotes are being added to the command list for each key-value pair.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable for the inner loop and remove the unnecessary double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable for the inner loop
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases.
