Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the way it constructs the command list. The bug appears to stem from the fact that the function is reusing the variable name `value` in the for loop that processes the dictionary items, which causes the original value to be overwritten.

To fix this bug, we should use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original value. Also, we need to handle the case where `value` is an empty dictionary, as the current implementation will return an empty list, when it should return an empty dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Fixed: Using 'val' instead of 'value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command if command else [name, '""']  # Fixed: Handling empty dictionary case
```

With the above correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now handle the input dictionary correctly and return the command list accordingly. This should address the failing tests.
