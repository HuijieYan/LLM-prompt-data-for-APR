The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be related to the handling of dictionary values. In the first case, the output should have been `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']` instead of `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`, and in the second case, the output should have been `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']` instead of `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`.

The bug appears to be caused by the fact that the values are not being wrapped in double quotes when they are added to the `command` list. This results in the values being interpreted as separate elements in the list, rather than as key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, we need to wrap the values in double quotes before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now properly wrap the values in double quotes before adding them to the `command` list, fixing the bug.
