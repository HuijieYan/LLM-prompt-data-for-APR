## A corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'val' to avoid reusing the name
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
        return command

```

After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class and failing test, it seems that the bug is caused by the use of double quotes around the property-value pairs in the `command` list. The failing test provides input parameter values and types, as well as the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. In both cases, the `command` list contains incorrect strings due to the unnecessary double quotes surrounding the property-value pairs.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function removes the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when appending them to the `command` list. Additionally, the variable name `value` inside the loop is renamed to `val` to avoid reusing the name of the input parameter.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
