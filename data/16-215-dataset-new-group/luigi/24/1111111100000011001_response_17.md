The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a `name` and `value` as input and return a command list based on the value provided. The function is designed to handle the case where the `value` is a dictionary and construct the command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

However, there is a bug in the implementation. The bug occurs because the inner loop is using the variable `value` for both the loop and as an argument to the method. This causes the `value` to be overwritten and results in incorrect commands being added to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, the inner loop variable should be renamed to something else to avoid overwriting the `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # fix: rename value to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
