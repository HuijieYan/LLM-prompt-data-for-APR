The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by not properly formatting the dictionary values when creating the `command` list. It is adding the `name` to the `command` list, but it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to properly format the dictionary key-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the value variable to val to avoid shadowing the outer scope value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Format the key-value pair and add to the command list
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs and create the `command` list as expected.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
