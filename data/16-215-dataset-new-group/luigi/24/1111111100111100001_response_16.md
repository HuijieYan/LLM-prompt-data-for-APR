The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it mistakenly surrounds the property value with double quotes when adding it to the command list. This causes the assertion to fail because the expected and actual lists contain differences with respect to the presence of double quotes around the property value.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when adding the property and its value to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from value to val to avoid name conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the double quotes
    return command
```
