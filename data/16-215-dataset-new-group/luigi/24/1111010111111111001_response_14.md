The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the incorrect handling of values for a command to be executed.
The function treats the value as a string and encloses it in double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected values.

To fix this bug, the function should not wrap the value in double quotes and should append the formatted `prop=value` as a single string to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly format the command list and pass the failing tests.
