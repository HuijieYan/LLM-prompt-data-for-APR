The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the fact that it is wrapping the dictionary values with double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the dictionary values when constructing the `command` list. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This correction removes the unnecessary double quotes from around the dictionary values, which should fix the failing tests.
