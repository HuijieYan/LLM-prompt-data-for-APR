### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a dictionary of key-value pairs and convert them into a list of command-line arguments. The bug seems to be related to the construction of the command list. It looks like the function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the values of the dictionary, causing a mismatch in the expected and actual output values.

### Bug Identification
The bug is identified as the addition of double quotes around the values of the dictionary when constructing the command list.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is using double quotes around the values of the dictionary, leading to an incorrect format in the command list. This is evident from the difference between the expected and actual output values, where the quotes around the values are causing the mismatch.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when constructing the command list. The values should be added to the command list as-is, without any additional formatting.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove double quotes around value
    return command
```
By making this change, the function will construct the command list in the correct format, without adding unnecessary quotes around the values. This should resolve the mismatch in the expected and actual output values.
