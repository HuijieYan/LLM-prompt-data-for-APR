The issue with the current implementation is that it adds unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the `command` list. This causes the lists being compared to have differing elements, leading to the test failures.

To fix this, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when formatting the property-value pair in the `command` list.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes here
    return command
```
