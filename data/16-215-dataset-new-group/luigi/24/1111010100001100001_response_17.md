The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly formatting the command list when constructing it from the input dictionary. The function is adding each key-value pair to the command list as separate elements, rather than as a single string in the format "key=value".

The cause of the bug is that the function is using the format '"{0}={1}"' to create the key-value pair, which adds unnecessary quotes around the key-value pair.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to construct the key-value pair without the unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{}={}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function will construct the command list properly, concatenating the name variable with the formatted key-value pair without unnecessary quotes.
