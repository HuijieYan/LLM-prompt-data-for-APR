This bug occurs in the `_dict_arg` function within the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file of the Luigi package. The function is tasked with constructing a command based on Spark parameters, but it takes in two arguments, which makes the intention and purpose of this function ambiguous.

The buggy function `_dict_arg` loops through a dictionary `value`, constructs a command based on the key-value pair in the dictionary, and appends these command arguments to the `command` list. However, the function uses the same name `value` for both the input argument and the loop variable, causing a conflict of variable scope and unintended behaviour. Additionally, it uses string formatting within the list, which can cause formatting errors in the command arguments.

The failing tests reveal that the main issue here is an incorrect processing of the dictionary into command arguments.

To fix the bug, it's essential to:
1. Use an appropriate variable name for the loop variable and the input argument to avoid confusion and maintain clarity.
2. Use `append()` method instead of concatenation to add elements to the command list, and avoid the use of string formatting within the list.

Here's the corrected `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{}={}".format(key, val))
    return command
```

The correction includes using `key` and `val` as looping variables instead of re-using `value`. Also, the command elements are appended separately rather than using string formatting within the list construction to ensure proper formatting.

These steps should address the bug in the `_dict_arg` function.
