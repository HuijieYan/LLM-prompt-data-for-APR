To fix the buggy function, we can start by renaming the variable `value` inside the for loop to something else to prevent shadowing the parameter `value` passed to the function. Additionally, we can remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted `{0}={1}` in the `command` list. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the variable value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the input dictionary correctly and format the command list as expected.

This corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned for both test cases.
