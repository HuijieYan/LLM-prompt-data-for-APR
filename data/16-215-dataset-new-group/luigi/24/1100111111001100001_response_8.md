The cause of the bug is that the function is using the same variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable, causing a collision and incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable inside the for loop, so it doesn't clash with the function parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name "prop_value" for the loop variable, we can avoid the collision and ensure that the function behaves as intended. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
