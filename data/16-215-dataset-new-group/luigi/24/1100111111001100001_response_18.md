The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by reusing the variable name `value` for the loop iteration variable and the input variable. This results in the input `value` being overwritten, leading to incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, the loop iteration variable should have a different name than the input variable. Renaming the loop iteration variable from `value` to `val` will resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
