The potential error in the buggy function is the reusing of the variable name "value" as both the input parameter and the loop variable. This can cause unintended behavior and incorrect output.

The cause of the bug is that the loop variable "value" overwrites the input parameter "value", leading to incorrect concatenation of the command list.

To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable from "value" to something else to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version renames the loop variable from "value" to "val" to avoid overwriting the input parameter "value".
