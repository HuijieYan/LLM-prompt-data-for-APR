The buggy function `_dict_arg` has a potential error in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The variable `name` is being used as a list index, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the variable `name` is being used both as a function parameter and also as an index in the list `command`. This can result in incorrect indexing and potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to rename the variable `name` in the `_dict_arg` function to something that does not conflict with the function parameter. Additionally, it's also a good practice to make the code more readable by using descriptive variable names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, arg_name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [arg_name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the variable `name` has been renamed to `arg_name` to avoid conflicts with the function parameter. Additionally, the inner variable `value` has been renamed to `val` to improve readability and maintain consistency.
