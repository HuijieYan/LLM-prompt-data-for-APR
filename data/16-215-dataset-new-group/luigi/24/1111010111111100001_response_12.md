Given the error messages and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug occurs when the `_dict_arg` function constructs the command list. The bug causes the function to add unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair in the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the command list. This mismatch causes the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid variable name conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

After applying this fix, the function should construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, and the failing test cases should pass.
