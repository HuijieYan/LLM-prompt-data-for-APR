The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values by using quotes around the key-value pairs. This is causing the test to fail when comparing the expected list of arguments with the actual list of arguments passed to `proc`. The runtime input/output variable values provided show that the function is adding quotes around the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function should not add quotes around the key-value pairs in the dictionary. Instead, it should simply concatenate the `name` and the formatted key-value pair to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should fix the bug and allow the tests to pass.
