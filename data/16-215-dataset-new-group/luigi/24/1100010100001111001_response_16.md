The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not properly format the dictionary items before adding them to the `command` list. The values are not enclosed in double quotes as expected.

We can fix the bug by modifying the code to properly format the dictionary items before adding them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for both given cases.
