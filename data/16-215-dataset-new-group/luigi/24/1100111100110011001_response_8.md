The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes to the property and value in the command list. This is leading to a mismatch in the output when compared to the expected values.

To fix this, the function should modify how it constructs the command list by excluding double quotes from property-value pairs when adding them to the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes, and it should pass the failing test cases provided.
