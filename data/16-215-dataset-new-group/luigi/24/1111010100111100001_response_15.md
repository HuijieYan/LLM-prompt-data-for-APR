The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is wrapping the property-value pair in double quotes when constructing the command list.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes from the property-value pair and reconstruct the command list accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now properly construct the command list without using double quotes for the property-value pairs, thus resolving the failing tests.
