The cause for the bug is that the function is wrapping the dictionary key-value pair in double quotes, which is not necessary. This is causing the command list to have unnecessary quotes and equals signs.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair and remove the format function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This will now properly format the command list without adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pair.
