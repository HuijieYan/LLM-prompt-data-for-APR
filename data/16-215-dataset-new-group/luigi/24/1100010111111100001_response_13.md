The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when building the command list. This causes the test cases to fail.

To fix this, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
