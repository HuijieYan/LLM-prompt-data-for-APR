The function `_dict_arg` has a bug causing the failing tests. The function takes `name` and `value` as input and appends the key-value pairs from `value` but without enclosing the `value` in single quotes. This results in an extra set of double quotes around the value in the final command, leading to the assert errors.

The potential error location within the function is the line where the command is constructed: `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line fails to properly handle the values and adds an extra set of quotes around the values.

To fix the bug, the function `_dict_arg` should be modified to properly handle the values without adding extra quotes. The values should be added as is, without additional quoting, assuming they are properly escaped and validated by the caller.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With the corrected function, the values from the dictionary will be added correctly without extra quoting and will produce the expected result. This should fix the failing test cases.
