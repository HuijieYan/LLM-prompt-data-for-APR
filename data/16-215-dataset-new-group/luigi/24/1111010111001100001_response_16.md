The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not account for the possibility of a string value being passed as the second argument. The function expects a dictionary, but the failing tests show that the second argument can also be a string.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `value` is a string and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    elif value and isinstance(value, str):
        command += [name, value]
    return command
```

By including the condition for handling string values in the `value` parameter, the corrected function should now be able to handle both dictionary and string inputs correctly. This should address the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass.
