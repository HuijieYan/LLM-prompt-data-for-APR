The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not adding the values of the dictionary properly to the command list. It is missing the double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is causing the failing test cases. The function should add the key-value pairs with double quotes to the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to format the key-value pairs correctly with double quotes and then add them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly format and add the key-value pairs to the command list, and it will pass the failing test cases.
