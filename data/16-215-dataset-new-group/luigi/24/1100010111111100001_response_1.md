The issue in the given function is that it is wrapping the values of the dictionary in double quotes, which is causing the failing test cases due to disagreement in the expected and actual outputs.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Remove the double quotes from the values being appended to the command list, as the double quotes are not required around the values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modification removes the unnecessary double quotes from the values in the command list, which should resolve the disagreements in the failing test cases.

With this correction, the provided failing test cases should now pass successfully.
