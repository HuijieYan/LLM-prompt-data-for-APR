## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename value to val to avoid confusion with the input parameter
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # change the format of the command to use --prop=val format
    return command
```

Explanation:
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to construct command arguments from a dictionary. However, it has two issues:
1. The format of the command is incorrect. It should use the `--prop=val` format, but the buggy function generates `'{0}={1}'` which doesn't include the `--` prefix.
2. The inner variable `value` gets overwritten by the loop iteration variable `value`, which causes a conflict.

The corrected version resolves these issues by renaming the loop iteration variable and changing the command format to use `--prop=val` format.

With these changes, the corrected function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
