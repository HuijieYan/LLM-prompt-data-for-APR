The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the fact that the inner `value` in the loop is overwriting the outer `value` parameter of the function. Additionally, there is no logic to handle non-dict input for the `value` parameter. 

To fix this bug, we can rename the inner `value` variable to avoid overwriting the function parameter, and add a check to handle non-dict input for the `value` parameter. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed inner "value" variable to "prop_value"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    elif isinstance(value, str):  # added a check to handle non-dict input
        command += [name, '"{0}"'.format(value)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly handle input values, whether they are dictionaries or strings, and should pass the failing test cases.
