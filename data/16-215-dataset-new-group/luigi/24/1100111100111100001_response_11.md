The issue in the buggy function is that it incorrectly includes double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This results in the failing tests, as the expected command list does not match the actual command list due to the presence of double quotes.

To fix this, we need to remove the double quotes from around the property and value when adding them to the command list. This can be achieved by using string formatting without quotes.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove quotes from the format
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will construct the command list without including double quotes around the property and value, addressing the issue identified in the failing tests.
