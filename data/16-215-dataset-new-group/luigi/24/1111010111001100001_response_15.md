The issue with the current implementation is that the `_dict_arg` function is not generating the command list correctly when the input `value` is a dictionary. It is not properly formatting the key-value pairs and appending them to the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the dictionary input properly and is not generating the command list as expected. This is evident from the fact that the command list does not contain the correctly formatted key-value pairs when the input is a dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the dictionary items and format the key-value pairs correctly before appending them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now properly generate the command list with the correctly formatted key-value pairs when the input `value` is a dictionary. This should resolve the failing tests.
