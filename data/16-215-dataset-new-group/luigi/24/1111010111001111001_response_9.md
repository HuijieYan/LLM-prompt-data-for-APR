The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the output command list, specifically for the dictionary values.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the dictionary values as key-value pairs within the command list. This results in the command list not matching the expected input for the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly format the dictionary values as key-value pairs within the command list. This can be achieved by using the correct string formatting and quoting the key-value pairs properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should format the command list as expected and pass the failing tests.
