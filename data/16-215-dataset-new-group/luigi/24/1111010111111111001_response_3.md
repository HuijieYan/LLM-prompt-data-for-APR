The issue with the buggy _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list. This causes the failing test cases to fail because the expected values do not match the actual output due to the extra quotes. 

To fix this issue, the quotes should be removed from around the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed quotes from property-value pair
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function will remove the extra quotes from property-value pairs and ensure that the output matches the expected values, fixing the failing test cases.
