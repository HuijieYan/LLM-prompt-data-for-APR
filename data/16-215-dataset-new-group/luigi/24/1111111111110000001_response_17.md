The `_dict_arg` function from the `SparkSubmitTask` class, located in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file, accepts two arguments, `name` and `value`, creating and modifying a `command` list based on the `name` and `value` parameters. This function is called by the `TestSparkSubmitTask` class for Spark job submissions. 

The failing test implies that the function doesn't handle dictionary values correctly - it should format them and add to the command list, but it results in an incorrect command instead. The error message asserts that certain dictionary values receive an unwanted extra pair of quotes (double quotes around the whole key-value pair).

The cause of the bug is likely due to the bug in environment setup with the different subprocess calls.

A strategy to fix the bug will involve checking how dictionary values are added to the command list and inspecting the subprocess setup within the `TestSparkSubmitTask` class. Additionally, handling of dictionary values will need to be revised to avoid adding unwanted double quotes around the key-value pair.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```
