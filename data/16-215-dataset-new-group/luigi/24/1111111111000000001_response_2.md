The issue is with the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class, which is not handling the dictionary value correctly when constructing the command.

Potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function:
1. The way the items from the dictionary `value` are being added to the `command`.
2. Incorrect formatting of the command when iterating through the dictionary items.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because when the `value` argument is processed, the `name` argument is being appended repeatedly, which leads to incorrect formatting of the command.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
Modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary and construct the command in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command += [f"{name}='{k}={v}'" for k, v in value.items()]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates over the key-value pairs of the dictionary and formats the command correctly. This should resolve the issue when processing the dictionary value in the spark submit command.

Once this change is applied, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly handle the dictionary value and generate the required command, which will allow the failing tests to pass.
