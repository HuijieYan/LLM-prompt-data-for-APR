The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly wraps the property-value pairs in double quotes when constructing the `command` list. This is causing the comparison to fail with the expected values that are not wrapped in quotes.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to construct the `command` list without wrapping the property-value pairs in quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the expected test cases will pass.
