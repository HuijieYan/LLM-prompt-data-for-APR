The given buggy function seems to be a part of the definition for a class called SparkSubmitTask. This class is a template task for running a Spark job. The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to process key-value pairs from a dictionary and return a list of command line arguments that will be used in the actual execution of the Spark job.

A couple of potential error locations in the function `_dict_arg` can be identified:
1. The condition `if value and isinstance(value, dict):` checks whether the value is a non-empty dictionary, but the name of the dictionary should be included as a command line argument regardless of its content. 
2. In the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, we should skip the quotation marks around the value since it is expected that named arguments do not contain quotes.

The cause of the bugs is the incorrect processing of the dictionary items and the adding of unnecessary quotes when building the command list. It leads to the failing tests due to incorrect command line arguments during test execution. 

A strategy for fixing the bug might involve:
- Verifying the input value and adding the name to the command list regardless of whether the value is an empty dictionary or not.
- Building the command with string format but without additional quotation marks around the value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):  # Change the condition to only check for dictionary type
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Adjust variable name to prevent shadowing
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Remove additional quotes from the format
    else:
        command += [name, ""]  # Add name to the command list even if value is not a dictionary
    return command
```
This corrected version of the function now addresses the issues identified and should resolve the failing test cases.
