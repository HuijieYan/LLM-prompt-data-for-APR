The problematic function here is _dict_arg, which is expected to construct a command list based on a given name and value. However, the bug in the function arises from the fact that it reuses the variable name `value` for the iteration through the dictionary items, which causes the value to be overwritten and lose track of the original value.

To fix this bug, the variable used in the for loop iteration should be different from the name of the input value. This can be achieved by using a different variable name inside the loop. Additionally, there is a check for the existence of the value, but it's not clear what should be done if the value is not a dictionary.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the iteration variable has been changed from `value` to `val` to avoid overwriting the original value. Also, a check has been added to ensure that the value is not `None` before attempting to iterate through its items.
