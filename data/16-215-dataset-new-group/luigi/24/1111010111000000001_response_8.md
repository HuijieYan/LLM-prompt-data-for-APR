## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class, test code

The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class in the `luigi.contrib.spark` module. This class is used for running Spark jobs within the Luigi framework. The failing tests are related to running Spark submit tasks under different configurations.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations in the `_dict_arg` function are related to the construction of the `command` list. The function is meant to build a list of command arguments based on the provided `name` and `value` parameters, considering the case where the `value` is a dictionary.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the failing test

The bug causes the `command` list not to be constructed correctly when the `value` is a dictionary. This is leading to incorrect arguments being passed to the Spark submit process in the failing test cases. The correct behavior should be to unpack the dictionary into individual command arguments based on key-value pairs.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_dict_arg` function to correctly generate command arguments from the input dictionary.

## Providing a corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the issue with the extra quotes around the key-value pairs has been fixed, and the function now correctly constructs the command list based on the input dictionary.
