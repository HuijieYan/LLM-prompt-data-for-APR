The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class seems to be constructing a command for Spark-submit but fails to include the `name` argument. This may lead to incorrect or incomplete command construction.

The bug is likely caused by the implementation of the `_dict_arg` function, where the `name` argument is not properly incorporated into the constructed command. The shortcomings of the buggy implementation become evident when running the tests, which expect a specific format of the command.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to ensure that the `name` argument is included in the constructed command, utilizing its value. This can be done by concatenating the `name` argument value with the formatted `prop` and `value` within the loop.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '--conf', '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With the corrected implementation, the command constructed by the function should now include the `name` argument along with the formatted `prop` and `value`, addressing the bug.
