The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function incorrectly handles the dictionary values when constructing the command list. It is wrapping the values with double quotes, which is causing the test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes from around the `value` in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
