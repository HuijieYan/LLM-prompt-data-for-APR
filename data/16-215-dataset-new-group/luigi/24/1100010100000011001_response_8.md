There are several issues with the buggy function.

1. The variable name `value` is used as both a parameter and a variable within the function, which can lead to confusion and errors.
2. The string formatting within the list concatenation is unnecessary and can cause errors in the output format.
3. The function does not account for the case when the `value` parameter is not a dictionary.

To fix these issues, we can rename the variable `value` within the function to `input_dict` to avoid confusion. Additionally, we can use string concatenation without using `format` to simplify the command concatenation. Finally, we can add a check to ensure that the input `value` is a dictionary before iterating over its items.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, input_dict):
    command = []
    if input_dict and isinstance(input_dict, dict):
        for prop, value in input_dict.items():
            command += [name, prop + '=' + value]
    return command
```

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the cases.
