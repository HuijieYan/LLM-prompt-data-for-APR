The buggy function is supposed to iterate through the key-value pairs in the input dictionary and add them to the command list in the format `name="key=value"`. However, the function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs and is not adding double quotes around the key-value strings. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs in the command list. Instead of adding the key-value pairs in the format `name="key=value"`, it is adding them in the format `name, 'key=value'`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the way the key-value pairs are added to the command list by properly formatting them with double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should format the key-value pairs correctly and return the expected values for the provided test cases.
