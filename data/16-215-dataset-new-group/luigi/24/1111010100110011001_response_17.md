The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly formatting the key-value pairs in the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected values. The function is expected to create a command list based on the key-value pairs in the input dictionary, but the formatting of the key-value pairs is incorrect.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correctly formatting the key-value pairs to ensure they match the expected format in the test cases. This can be achieved by removing the extra quotes around the property and value in the key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove the quotes around prop and val
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the key-value pairs are formatted using `{0}={1}` without additional quotes. This ensures that the key-value pairs in the command list match the expected format, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
