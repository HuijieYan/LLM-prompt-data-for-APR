The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, which is not the expected behavior. The expected output should have the format `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']` instead of `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes from the format used to append the key-value pairs to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should produce the expected output for the given input cases.
