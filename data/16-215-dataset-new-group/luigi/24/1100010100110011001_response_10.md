The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it adds extra double quotes around the property and value when building the command list. This causes the test cases to fail because they expect the properties and their values to be added to the command list without double quotes.

To fix this bug, the function should remove the extra double quotes when adding the properties and values to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
