The cause of the bug is allowing extra quotes around values when generating the command list. These extra quotes cause the test to fail because they are not expected in the call. 

To fix the issue, remove the extra quotes that are added around the values when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid shadowing the outer variable
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed extra quotes
    return command
```
By removing the extra quotes, the corrected version of the function should now correctly construct the command list without the undesired quotes.
