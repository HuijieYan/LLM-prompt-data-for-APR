The issue in the buggy function is that when creating the list `command`, it is not handling the dictionary items correctly and is not formatting the strings as expected.

To fix this, we can modify the function to properly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary and append them to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            formatted_prop_val = '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)
            command += [name, formatted_prop_val]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
