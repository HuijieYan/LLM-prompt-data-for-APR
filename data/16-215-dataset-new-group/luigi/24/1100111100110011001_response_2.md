## Correction:

The issue in the buggy function is that it is incorrectly adding the key-value pairs of the dictionary `value` to the `command` list. It is also adding unnecessary double quotes around the values. This is causing a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `for` loop to correctly create the command list by formatting the key-value pairs without the unnecessary double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will create the `command` list as expected and the test cases should pass without any issues.
