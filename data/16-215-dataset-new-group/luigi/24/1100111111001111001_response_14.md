The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the values of the dictionary are not being formatted correctly. The values should be enclosed in double quotes, and the key-value pairs should be separated by an equal sign.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the dictionary values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the dictionary values, and the failing tests will pass.
