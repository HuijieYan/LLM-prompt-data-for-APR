The issue with the buggy function is that it adds quotes around the property values when constructing the command list. This is causing the actual output to differ from the expected output, leading to failing tests.

To fix this bug, we should remove the quotes from around the property values in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed the quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly construct the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the property values. This will ensure that the actual output matches the expected output, resolving the failing tests.
