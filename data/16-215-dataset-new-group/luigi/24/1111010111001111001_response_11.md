The issue with the `_dict_arg` method is that when it creates the command list, it is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. It should be creating each key-value pair with the format `key=value`, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, the method needs to correctly format the key-value pairs when creating the command list.

Also, in the failing test cases, the expected output includes the key-value pairs enclosed in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
