The buggy function _dict_arg is attempting to create a command for Spark Submit based on the input dictionary. However, the bug lies in the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]", where it is trying to add the name and value of the dictionary items as separate elements to the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the command list is not being constructed correctly, as it is attempting to add the name and value as separate elements within quotes. This will result in a malformed command when used for Spark Submit.

To fix this bug, the correct approach would be to construct the command as a single string with the proper formatting for Spark Submit. This can be achieved by using the "name" and "value" to construct the command string in the correct format.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += ['{0}={1}'.format(name, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the command list is constructed by concatenating the "name" and "val" in the correct format for Spark Submit. This will ensure that the command is constructed properly and can be used for running Spark jobs.
