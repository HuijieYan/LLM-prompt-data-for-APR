To identify what's causing the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we need to look at its relationship with the SparkSubmitTask class, the `name` function, and the test functions in the `spark_test.py`.

The `_dict_arg` function in `luigi.contrib.spark` is part of the `SparkSubmitTask` class, which is used to run a Spark job. The function is expected to generate a command from a dictionary of arguments. The bug appears to be related to the construction of the command.

The `name` function is not used in the `_dict_arg` function, so it's irrelevant to the bug. The failing test functions seem to be checking the behavior of `SparkSubmitTask` instances under certain configurations.

The cause of the bug likely lies in the way the command is constructed within the `_dict_arg` function. It may not be handling the dictionary of properties and values correctly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of the `_dict_arg` function to correctly generate the command from the dictionary of arguments. This may involve iterating over the dictionary and constructing the command using the key-value pairs.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The change in the corrected version is to use `val` (or any other specific variable name) instead of `value` inside the loop to avoid conflict with the outer `value` parameter. This should allow the correct construction of the command array based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
