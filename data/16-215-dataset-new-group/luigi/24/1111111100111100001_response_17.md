The bug in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be related to how the key-value pairs in the input dictionary are being handled. The function is intended to construct a list of command-line arguments from a dictionary, but it is not handling the key-value pairs correctly.

The cause of the bug is that when constructing the command list, the function is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, which is causing the assertion errors in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary quotes around prop and val
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should handle the key-value pairs in the input dictionary properly and construct the command list without unnecessary double quotes. This should make the function pass the failing test cases.
