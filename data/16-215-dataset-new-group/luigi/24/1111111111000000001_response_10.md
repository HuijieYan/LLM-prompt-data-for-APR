The source code provided contains a class `SparkSubmitTask` and a method `_dict_arg` within that class which is expected to return a command. However, there is a bug in the `_dict_arg` method that is causing it to fail the test cases.

The bug is most likely in the `for` loop inside the `_dict_arg` method. When iterating through the dictionary `value`, the method reuses the variable name `value` as the loop iterator. This overwrites the original `value` value that was passed into the method, leading to incorrect command generation.

To fix this bug, the loop variable in the `_dict_arg` function should be renamed to avoid overwriting the method's argument `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renaming the loop variable to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
``` 
With this correction, the `_dict_arg` method should now generate the correct command and pass the failing test cases.
