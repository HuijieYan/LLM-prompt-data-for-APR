## Analysis
The buggy function seems to be intended to take a dictionary as input and convert it into a list of command arguments. However, there are several issues in the code:
1. The variable `value` is being used both as the input parameter and as a different variable within the function, causing a conflict.
2. The string formatting for the command arguments seems incorrect, resulting in unexpected values in the `command` list.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being shadowed within the function, leading to unexpected behavior in the loop that attempts to construct the command arguments.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, I will rename the loop variable `value` to something else and update the string formatting for the command arguments to ensure it produces the expected values.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
