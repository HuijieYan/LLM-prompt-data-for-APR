The buggy function `_dict_arg` does not correctly generate the command list. It fails to include the 'name' variable and also uses 'value' as both the loop variable and the function parameter, causing a conflict.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly appending the command list with the formatted key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly append the command list with the formatted key-value pairs and include the 'name' variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
