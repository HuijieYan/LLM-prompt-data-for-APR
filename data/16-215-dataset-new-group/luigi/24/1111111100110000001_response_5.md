The main problem in the _dict_arg function is that it appends the key-value pairs separated by an equal sign to the command list as a single string. 

# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, prop + "=" + str(value)]
        return command
```
