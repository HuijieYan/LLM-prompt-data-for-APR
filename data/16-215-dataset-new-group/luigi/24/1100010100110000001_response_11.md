The issue here is with the `_dict_arg` function in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file. The problem lies with constructing the `command` list. The function is using a dictionary to create a list of commands. However, it's not separating key and value properly and causing the test to fail.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly create the list of command arguments by properly separating the key and value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # removed extra double quotes
    return command
```

This version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
