The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property values when creating the command list. This is causing the test to fail when comparing the expected and actual command list.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the double quotes around the property values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```
