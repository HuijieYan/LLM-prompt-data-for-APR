The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the values from the dictionary are not being formatted correctly when adding to the `command` list. Instead of formatting prop and value as `"prop=value"`, they are being formatted as `prop=value`. 

To fix this bug, we should update the formatting in the loop where the dictionary values are being added to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

By making this change, the `command` list will be correctly formatted with the key-value pairs from the dictionary.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
