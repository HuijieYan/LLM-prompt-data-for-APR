The issue with the buggy function is that it is not formatting the output command string correctly. The function is not enclosing the property-value pairs in quotes, and it's also adding unnecessary equals signs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly format the output command string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values given in the test cases.
