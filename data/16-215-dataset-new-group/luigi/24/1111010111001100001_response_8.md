The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not handling the dictionary values correctly. When creating the command list, it's not adding the name parameter correctly, resulting in a malformed command list when the input value is a dictionary. 

The cause of the bug is that when the value parameter is a dictionary, the function is not iterating over the dictionary items correctly and constructing the command list with the proper format.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the dictionary items, construct the command list properly, and return it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use a different variable name to avoid overwriting the input value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now handle dictionary values correctly and construct the command list as expected, passing the failing tests.
