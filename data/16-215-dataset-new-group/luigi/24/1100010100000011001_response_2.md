## Analysis
The function is intended to take in a name and a dictionary of key-value pairs, then construct a list of command strings based on the key-value pairs.

## Identify potential error locations
1. The function is not handling the case where `value` is empty or not a dictionary.
2. The function is overwriting the variable `value` within the loop.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the input dictionary and the overwriting of the `value` variable within the loop.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if the `value` is not empty and is a dictionary before continuing.
2. Use a different variable name inside the loop to avoid overwriting the `value` variable.

## Corrected version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name to avoid overwriting
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
