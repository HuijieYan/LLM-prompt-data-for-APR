## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renamed 'value' variable to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # changed 'value' variable to 'val' to avoid conflict
    return command
```

Explanation:
The buggy function has a variable name conflict as it reuses the same variable name 'value' in the for loop which leads to the overwriting of the original value of 'value'. This causes incorrect output in the command list, leading to failing tests.

The suggested fix is to rename the variable 'value' to 'val' inside the for loop to avoid the conflict.

By making this change, the function should now correctly build the command list based on the input dictionary 'value' and pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
