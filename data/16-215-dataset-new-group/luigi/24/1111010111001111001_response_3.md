                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

## Explanation of the bug and strategy for fixing it
The bug occurs because the `value` and `prop` variables are being overwritten within the loop. The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to use different variable names for the loop counter and the value within the loop.
