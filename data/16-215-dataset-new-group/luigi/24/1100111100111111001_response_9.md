The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is wrapping the property-value pairs in double quotes, which is causing the test cases to fail. This is evident from the difference in the error message. The expected format of the property-value pair in the `command` list is without double quotes, while the actual format has unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the property-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
