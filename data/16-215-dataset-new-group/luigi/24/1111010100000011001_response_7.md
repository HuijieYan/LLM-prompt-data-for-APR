The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly creates the command list when the value is a dictionary. The function should iterate through the dictionary and add each key-value pair to the command list in the format `"{prop}={value}"`. However, the function currently adds the entire key-value pair inside double quotes, which is not the correct format.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes and adjust how the key-value pairs are added to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
