The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to generate a list of command line arguments based on a dictionary input. However, there are a few potential error locations within the function:

1. The variable name `value` is being reused as an iterator within the for loop, which can cause confusion and potential bugs.
2. The command list is not being properly constructed with the command arguments.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly constructing the command list based on the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through the input dictionary and construct the command list with the proper format for each key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
With this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list based on the input dictionary.
