The issue is that the function `_dict_arg` goes through each item in the dictionary and adds the key-value pair as a concatenated string to the `command` list. This approach mistakenly encloses the values in double quotes even though they are not required.

The cause of the issue is that the dictionary values are enclosed within double quotes when constructing the command list, which leads to the difference in the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the code of the `_dict_arg` function needs to extract the dictionary values without enclosing them in double quotes. This can be done using the `name`, `prop`, and `str` functions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, str(value))]
    return command
```
