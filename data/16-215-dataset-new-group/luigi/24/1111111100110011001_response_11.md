The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the use of unnecessary double quotes around the property value when adding it to the `command`. This results in the unexpected results in the unit tests and the AssertionError when comparing the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from around the property value when adding it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _dict_arg function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary double quotes around val
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now properly construct the `command` list without unnecessary double quotes and will pass the failing unit tests.
