The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding double quotes around the property and value when forming the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists in the failing tests.

The fix for this bug is to remove the double quotes from around the property and value when adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
