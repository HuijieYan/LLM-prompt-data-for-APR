The problem in the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it incorrectly adds double quotes around the property value when constructing the command list. This leads to the assertion error in the failing test cases. 

To fix the bug, the buggy function `_dict_arg` should be modified to handle the property value without adding double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, the function constructs the command list in the correct format without adding unnecessary double quotes around the property value. This should resolve the assertion errors in the failing test cases.
