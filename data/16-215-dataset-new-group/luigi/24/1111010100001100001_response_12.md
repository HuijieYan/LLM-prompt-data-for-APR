The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that the function is not creating the command list in the expected format when iterating through the dictionary. It should create the command list in the format "--conf prop1=val1" instead of "--conf 'prop1=val1'".

To fix the bug, we should remove the quotes around the format used to concatenate the property and value in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
