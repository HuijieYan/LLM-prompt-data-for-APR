# The buggy function _dict_arg has a potential error location at the line:
# command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
# The bug is caused by the reusing of the variable name for both the function parameter and the loop iteration variable.

# To fix the bug, we should rename the loop iteration variable to avoid reusing the same variable name.

# Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renamed the loop iteration variable to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # using the renamed loop iteration variable 'val'
    return command
```
