The issue with the buggy function is that it's generating the command list incorrectly. It's adding double quotes when creating the key-value pairs for the dictionary arguments. This is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _dict_arg function to correct the way it constructs the command list.

We should update the function to create the command list by directly appending the key-value pairs without enclosing them in double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now return the command list in the expected format, and the failing tests should pass.
