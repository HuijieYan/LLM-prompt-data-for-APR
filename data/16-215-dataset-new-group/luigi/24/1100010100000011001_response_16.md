The bug in the provided function is that the inner loop variable `value` is being overwritten with the outer function parameter `value`.

To fix this bug, we can simply use a different variable name for the inner loop value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
