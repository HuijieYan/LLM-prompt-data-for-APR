The cause of the bug is that the code is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into a string format that's expected for the `command` list. The function is incorrectly using double quotes around the entire key-value pair and adding an unnecessary equals sign. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes and equals sign, and format the key-value pairs as `key=value` without quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + '=' + prop + '=' + val)
    return command
```
