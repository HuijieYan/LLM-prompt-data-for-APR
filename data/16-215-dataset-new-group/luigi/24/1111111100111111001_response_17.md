The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the way it constructs the `command` list. Instead of wrapping the property and value in double quotes within the `command` list, it should be added without quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly construct the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

This version ensures that the properties and values are appended to the `command` list without quotes, as expected by the test cases.
