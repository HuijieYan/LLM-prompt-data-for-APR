The bug in the given function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output. This is causing the tests to fail.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the quotes around the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
