The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the dictionary values within the `_dict_arg` function. The function incorrectly wraps the property-value pairs within double quotes, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

To fix this bug, we should remove the quotes around the property-value pairs within the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around the property-value pairs, the function will now return the expected results and pass the failing tests.
