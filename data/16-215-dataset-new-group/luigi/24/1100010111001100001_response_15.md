The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to construct a command list based on the input dictionary. However, the bug lies in the line where the function is constructing the command list. The bug occurs when the function is iterating through the dictionary items and adding the key-value pairs to the command list. The bug specifically lies in the formatting of the key-value pairs where the function is adding extra double quotes around the key-value pairs. This results in the command list being malformed and causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding extra double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now construct the command list without adding extra double quotes and should pass the failing tests.
