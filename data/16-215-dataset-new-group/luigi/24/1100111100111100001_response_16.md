The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail, as the expected command list values are not matching the actual values due to the extra double quotes.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should construct the command list without adding the additional double quotes around the property and value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will now properly construct the command list without adding extra double quotes, and the failing test cases should pass.
