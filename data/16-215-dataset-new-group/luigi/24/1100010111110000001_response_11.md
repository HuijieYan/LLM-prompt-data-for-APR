The buggy function `_dict_arg` seems to be generating a command as a list based on the name and value passed. It checks if the value is non-empty and is a Python dictionary. If these conditions are true, it iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends it as an entry to the `command` list.

The failing tests are failing with an assertion error stating that the generated command list differs from expected output. The error appears to be related to the format in which the key-value pairs are constructed.

The cause of the bug relates to how the dictionary items are being concatenated to the `command` list. It appears that the bug is caused by wrapping the property and value within double quotes during the iteration process.

A potential solution to fix the bug would be to modify the code to directly append the property and value to the command list without adding the quotes. 

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, value))
    return command
``` 

This version removes the double quotes around the key-value pairs being added to the `command` list and instead uses the proper key-value format expected in a command list in Python.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the failing tests pass.
