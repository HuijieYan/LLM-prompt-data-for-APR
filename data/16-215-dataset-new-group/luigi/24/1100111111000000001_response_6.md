The bug seems to be in the _dict_arg function where a list called "command" is being appended with incorrectly formatted string values. This buggy behavior is causing the test functions to fail.

The cause of the bug can be identified by observing the failing test cases and the comparison between the expected and actual values. The failing tests are checking if the subprocess command being called matches the expected list, and the bug is causing the command to be formatted incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function needs to correctly format the command list and ensure that the elements are appended in the correct structure.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Fixed the format of the appended values
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the command list is formatted with the correct structure, using the "--key=value" format for each item in the dictionary.

By using this corrected version, the failing test cases should now pass.
