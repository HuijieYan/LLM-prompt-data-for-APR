The buggy function is intended to take a name and a dictionary of values, and construct a command list by iterating over the dictionary items and formatting them appropriately. However, the current implementation is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the values in the dictionary are not being formatted properly in the command list. The strings are not being quoted as expected.

To fix the bug, the values in the command list should be formatted without quotes, and the entire key-value pair should be enclosed in quotes.


Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly format the key-value pairs from the dictionary into the command list, satisfying the expected input/output values.
