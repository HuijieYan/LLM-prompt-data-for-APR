The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary. The loop that iterates through the dictionary items and constructs the command list is not handling the values properly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the loop that constructs the command list to properly handle the dictionary values and concatenate the name and formatted property-value pair to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the input dictionary and construct the command list accordingly. It should pass the failing tests provided.
