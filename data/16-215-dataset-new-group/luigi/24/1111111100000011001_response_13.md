## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The corrected version of the function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... (other parts of the class)
    
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here to avoid conflict
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

In the original buggy function, there was a variable name conflict within the for loop. The variable `value` was being used for the dictionary iteration and also being used as an input parameter to the function, causing a conflict and leading to incorrect results.

I have fixed the bug by using a different variable name (`val`) for the iteration within the for loop. This change resolves the variable name conflict and ensures that the correct values are appended to the `command` list.

The corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
