Based on the error messages, the `_dict_arg` function that the failing tests are calling is not returning the expected command line arguments list.

It seems there is a discrepancy in the format of the `--conf` argument. The failing tests are trying to execute certain command line arguments to a mocked subprocess (proc) and they are expecting a specific list, but the list generated by the `_dict_arg` function is not as expected. This leads to the assertion errors.

The difference is that the `--conf` argument is sometimes surrounded by double quotes and sometimes not, leading to inconsistency in the call arguments list that the failing tests are expecting.

Based on this analysis, a potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_dict_arg` function in such a way that it consistently generates the `--conf` argument without extra quotes, in accordance with the expected format in the failing tests.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```
