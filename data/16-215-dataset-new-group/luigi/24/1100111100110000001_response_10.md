The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the `value` parameter shadowing the inner variable with the same name within the for loop. This results in the command list containing a combination of names and values, where some are improperly quoted because they have equal signs. As a result, the assertion fails due to the mismatch in the structure of the lists. 

The initial problematic implementation:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

In the buggy test cases shown in the error messages, we see that the problem arises from the incorrect handling of property-value pairs. Based on the error messages, the quotes and equal signs appear inappropriately in the final command list. This is because within the for loop, the variable `value` is reused as the value part iteratively, causing property names and values to be added to the list incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the inner variable in the for loop should be named differently than the outer variable. In the corrected function, it is recommended to maintain a clear distinction between the outer `value` and the inner `val` to enforce separation of concerns and avoid conflicts:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the output of the `_dict_arg` function should now be consistent with the expected lists in the test cases, ensuring that the tests pass successfully.
