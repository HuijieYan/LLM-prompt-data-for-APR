The buggy function is intended to create a command list for a Spark job to be run with specific configuration properties. The function takes a name and a value, where the value is expected to be a dictionary, and converts it into a command list.

The potential error in the function is that it incorrectly formats the command list when building the command. Specifically, it incorrectly treats the property and value as separate items and adds unnecessary quotation marks.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the command list as expected. It is adding unnecessary quotation marks around the property and value pairs.

To fix the bug, the function should build the command list by directly concatenating the property and value without adding extra quotation marks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly format the command list as expected, satisfying the provided test cases.
