The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is caused by the fact that the variable `value` is being used as both the input argument and a variable to store the inner dictionary value. This causes the variable `value` to be overwritten and lose its original value, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the inner dictionary value to avoid overwriting the input argument `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, inner_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, inner_value)]
    return command
```

By using the variable name `inner_value` for the inner dictionary value, we avoid overwriting the original input argument `value`. This will ensure that the function correctly generates the command list without losing the original input values.
