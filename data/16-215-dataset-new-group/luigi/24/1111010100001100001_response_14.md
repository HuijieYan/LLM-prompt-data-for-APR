The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the `name` parameter is being added to the `command` list in each iteration of the loop. Additionally, the value for each property is being enclosed in double quotes unnecessarily.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the `name` parameter from being added to the `command` list within the loop, and to remove the unnecessary double quotes from around the property values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(name, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary `name` parameter from being added to the `command` list and eliminates the unnecessary double quotes around the property values. This should fix the bug and produce the expected output.
