Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function is using the same variable name `value` for both the input and the loop variable, which can cause conflicts and incorrect results.
2. The function is not handling the case where the input value is not a dictionary, which could result in an unexpected output.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is likely causing the failing test cases because it does not correctly construct the `command` list based on the input dictionary.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the name of the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid conflicts.
2. Add a condition to handle the case when the input value is not a dictionary.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed the loop variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    else:
        command = [name, str(value)]  # If value is not a dictionary, just add it to the command
    return command
```
