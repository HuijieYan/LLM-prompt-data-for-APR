The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the variable `value` being used as both the input parameter and a variable inside the function. This causes a conflict and leads to incorrect results when iterating through the dictionary items.

To fix the bug, the variable name inside the loop should be changed to avoid conflict with the input parameter. Also, the format of the command building should be adjusted to correctly construct the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command.append(name)  # Append the argument name
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(prop, val))  # Format and append the property and value
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass.
