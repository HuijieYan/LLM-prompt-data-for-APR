The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the dictionary values for the command list. The function is not enclosing the property and value in quotes as expected by the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the property and value with quotes before adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
