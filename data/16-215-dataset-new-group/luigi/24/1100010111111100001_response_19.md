The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it is adding unnecessary quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list. This is causing the failing test as it expects the command list without quotes.

To fix this, we need to remove the quotes around the property-value pairs when adding them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list without unnecessary quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
