The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to build a command by iterating through the key-value pairs of a dictionary and appending them to a list. However, it has a bug that causes it to incorrectly format the output command. The bug occurs when constructing the command using the format `"{0}={1}"`. This results in an incorrect format when appending the name and value to the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the format used to construct the command. We can simply concatenate the prop and value with an equal sign instead of using the `format` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + '=' + val)
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests provided.
