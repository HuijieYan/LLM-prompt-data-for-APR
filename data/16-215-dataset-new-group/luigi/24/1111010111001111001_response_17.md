The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to iterate through a dictionary and create a list of command arguments. However, the bug lies in the way it formats the string to append to the command list. Instead of formatting the string properly, it adds unnecessary quotes. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to construct the command list without unnecessary quotes and handle the formatting of key-value pairs properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will iterate through the dictionary, properly format the key-value pairs, and create a list of command arguments without unnecessary quotes. It should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
