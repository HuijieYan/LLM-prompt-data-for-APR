The issue in the provided code is that the `_dict_arg` function is not correctly handling dictionary values when generating the `command` list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding quotes around the dictionary key-value pairs, which is not necessary and causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the value is a dictionary, and if so, add the key-value pair directly to the `command` list without adding quotes around them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fixed version, the function should now correctly generate the command list for the input dictionary values and pass the failing test cases.
