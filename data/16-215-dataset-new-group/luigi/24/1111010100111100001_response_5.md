The bug is caused by the function incorrectly adding quotes around the property-value pair if the value is a dictionary. This results in the assertions failing because the expected and actual values do not match due to the presence of quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pair. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will generate the command list without unnecessary quotes, and both the cases provided with their failing tests should now pass.
