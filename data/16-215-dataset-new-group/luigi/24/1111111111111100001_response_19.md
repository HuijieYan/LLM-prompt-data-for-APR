The issue in the buggy function is that it is enclosing the property value in double quotes when creating the command list, leading to a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases. This is causing the `AssertionError` in both test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when appending the property and its value to the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This modification will correctly format the command list and address the issue with the double quotes in the property value. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
