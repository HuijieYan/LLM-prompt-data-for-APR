The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly wraps the property and value in quotes for the command list, causing the failing tests to compare the command list with unexpected quote characters.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property and value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this fix, the failing tests should pass without any assertion errors.
