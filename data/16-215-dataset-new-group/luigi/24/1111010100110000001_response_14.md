## The corrected version

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, prop, value]  # Removed the 'format' function to avoid accidental double-quoting
        return command
```

Correction Strategy:
- The error messages indicate that in the two failing tests, there are differing elements in the lists that suggest that the command construction is incorrect. 
- The cause of the bug is in the `_dict_arg` function, where the 'format' function inappropriately double-quotes the arguments leading to list differences.

Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the function removes the 'format' function to avoid accidental double-quoting and uses a more straightforward list construction.

By making this change, the corrected function is expected to construct the command list properly and resolve the list differences in the failing tests.
