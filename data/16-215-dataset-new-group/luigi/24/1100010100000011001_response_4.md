## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the expected input/output values
The buggy function, `_dict_arg`, takes two parameters, `name` and `value`. It is expected to process the `value` parameter, which is a dictionary, and construct a `command` list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The expected output is a `command` list containing formatted key-value pairs.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the function lies in the loop that iterates through the key-value pairs in the input dictionary `value`. There may be an issue with constructing the `command` list and formatting the key-value pairs properly.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the expected input/output variable values
The buggy function may be failing to properly construct the `command` list and format the key-value pairs. This could lead to incorrect values in the `command` list and mismatches with the expected output.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `command` list is constructed correctly and that the key-value pairs are formatted properly within the loop.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
