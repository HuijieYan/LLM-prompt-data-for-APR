The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding the dictionary values to the `command` list. In the failing test cases, the expected values include the dictionary properties directly without quotes, while the current implementation of the function adds the properties within double quotes. This is causing the assertion errors in the tests.

To fix the bug, the function should stop adding unnecessary double quotes around the dictionary properties.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will return a list of properly formatted arguments as expected, and the failing tests should pass.
