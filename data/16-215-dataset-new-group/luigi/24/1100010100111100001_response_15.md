The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by adding quotation marks around the property and value in the command list for dictionary arguments. This results in a mismatch between the expected command list and the actual command list in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotation marks around the property and value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the correct command list and pass the failing test cases.
