The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the value part of the command is not being enclosed in double quotes, as it should be according to the expected output. This is causing the list to be constructed incorrectly in the command variable.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the value part is enclosed in double quotes as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected values for the provided test cases.
