The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it does not handle the dictionary values correctly. Instead of formatting and adding each key-value pair as a separate item in the `command` list, it is adding them as a single string. This results in incorrect output that causes the test cases to fail.

To fix this issue, the function should properly format and add each key-value pair as a separate item in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing test cases.
