The potential error in the _dict_arg function is that it is overwriting the 'value' parameter in the for loop, which can cause unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the original code is iterating through the 'value' dictionary, but it is also using the same variable name 'value' for the iteration, which overwrites the original 'value' parameter. This can lead to incorrect command generation.

To fix the bug, the variable name in the for loop should be changed to something different from 'value' to avoid overwriting the original parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name to 'val' to avoid overwriting 'value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
