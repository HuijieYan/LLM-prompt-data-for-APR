The issue with the _dict_arg function seems to be with how it is handling the construction of the command list. The function is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly constructing the command list for key-value pairs in the input dictionary. It is not using the correct formatting for the key-value pairs, leading to incorrect output when the function is called.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for constructing the command list to properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')
    
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test cases.
