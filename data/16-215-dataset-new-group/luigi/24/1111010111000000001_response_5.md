The buggy function `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class has the potential error of overwriting the variable `value` within the for loop, which causes unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is due to the reassignment of the `value` variable within the for loop. The original value passed as an argument to the function is being overwritten by the loop variable.

To fix the bug, the loop variable should be renamed to avoid conflict with the function argument.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

By renaming the loop variable to `val`, we ensure that the original `value` argument remains unchanged while constructing the `command` list.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
