The `'_dict_arg'` function contained in the `luigi/contrib/spark.py` file is causing all the failing test cases. 

The `'_dict_arg'` function takes in 3 arguments: 'self', `name`, and `value` but inside the function for loop parameter and it's value are with the same name, it is causing the value passed in the function to be overridden and hence only the last value in the dictionary is shown as an output to the `proc.call_args[0][0]` in the failing  tests.

The bugs in the function `_dict_arg` can be fixed by modifying it as provided below:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
By renaming the `value` within for loop to `val`, it identifies the correct value to add to the command list, thus solving the bug.

The correction function `_dict_arg` is as given below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
