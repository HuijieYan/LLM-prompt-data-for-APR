The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the value for the `--conf` argument is being enclosed in double quotes when forming the command list, which is causing the tests to fail due to a mismatch in the expected and actual command lists.

To fix the bug, the function should not enclose the property-value pair in double quotes for the `--conf` argument when forming the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)])
    return command
```

With the above correction, the function will correctly form the command list without enclosing the property-value pair in double quotes for the `--conf` argument, resolving the issue with the failing tests.
