The `'_dict_arg'` function is creating a list of command arguments based on the input dictionary. The potential error in this function could be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where `name` and `value` could be causing confusion with the function parameter names. This could lead to incorrect composition of the command list.

The bug may have caused the failing test to compare the proc call arguments with the expected command list and failed to match them.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to use different variables in the loop to avoid confusion with the function parameter names.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed 'value' to 'val'
    return command
```

By fixing the variable names inside the loop, this corrected version should now pass the failing test.
