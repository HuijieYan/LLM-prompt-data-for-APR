The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is reusing the variable name `value` in the for loop, which overwrites the original `value` parameter. This causes the function to use the wrong value when constructing the command list.

To fix this bug, we need to use a different variable name for the loop iteration. Also, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the `prop=value` string in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version of the function, the bug is fixed, and the function will correctly construct the `command` list using the original `value` parameter and the loop variable `val`.
