The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it overwrites the `value` variable used in the loop with the loop iteration's value. This causes it to only return the last key-value pair from the dictionary. 

To fix the bug, the code should use a different variable name for the loop iteration value, and also join the `name` and the key-value pairs into a single string before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} \"{prop}={val}\"")
    return command
```

This version uses a variable named `val` for the loop iteration value and joins `name` and the key-value pairs into a single string before adding them to the `command` list. This should ensure that the function processes all key-value pairs in the input dictionary and returns the correct command list.
