The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property value when creating the command list. This is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to remove the quotes around the property value when adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will create the command list without adding unnecessary quotes around the property value, resolving the assertion errors in the failing tests.
