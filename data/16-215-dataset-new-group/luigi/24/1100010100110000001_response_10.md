The buggy function `_dict_arg` is causing the failing test. The function aims to construct a command by iterating through a dictionary, `value` and formatting the key-value pairs. However, the issue lies in the formatting of the key-value pairs using quotations. 

The cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the function mistakenly enclosing the key-value pairs within quotation marks, which leads to a mismatch between the expected command and the actual command. This results in failing assertions due to the discrepancy in the formatting of the elements within the command lists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to build a command without enclosing the key-value pairs within quotation marks, facilitating the accurate formation of the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

After applying the above changes, the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function now formats the key-value pairs without enclosing them within double quotes. This correction should address the failing test cases and ensure that the command list is constructed accurately.
