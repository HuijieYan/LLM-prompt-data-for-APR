The issue with the current `_dict_arg` function is that it is creating the `command` list with incorrectly formatted key-value pairs when the input `value` is a dictionary. It is adding the quotes around the `prop=value` pair, which is not needed.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the quotes around the `prop=value` pair when appending it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly append the key-value pairs to the `command` list without unnecessary quotes. This should address the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
