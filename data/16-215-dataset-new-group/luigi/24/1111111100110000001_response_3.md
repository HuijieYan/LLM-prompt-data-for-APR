The buggy function is `_dict_arg` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The function appears to be designed to create a command for passing properties to a Spark job from a dictionary, but it incorrectly includes quotes around the property and its value in the command list, leading to assertion errors when the command is tested against an expected value.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the formatting of the properties and values, as well as unnecessary quoting. The function appears to be creating command arguments by adding the property name and its value enclosed by `"prop=value"` to a list, where it should be adding just `prop=value`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to remove the unnecessary quotes around the properties and their values and modify how the command is being constructed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

By using the `.format()` method on the strings and not including the unnecessary quotes, we have fixed the original problem with the function.
