The buggy function is `_dict_arg` within the `SparkSubmitTask` class. This function is intended to generate a command for submitting a Spark job based on a dictionary of arguments. However, there are potential error locations within the function:

1. The function is using the variable name `value` for both the input dictionary and the value within the dictionary's items. This can cause confusion and potential errors.

2. The function is not handling the case where the input `value` is not a dictionary, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly constructing the command for submitting a Spark job based on the input dictionary of arguments.

To fix the bug, we can rename the variable used in the for loop within the function to avoid confusion. Additionally, we should handle the case where the input `value` is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, we renamed the variable `prop` to `key` to avoid confusion with the outer `value` parameter. We also removed the unnecessary check for `value` before entering the loop, because the `isinstance` check already covers that case. This version ensures that the command is correctly constructed based on the input dictionary of arguments.
