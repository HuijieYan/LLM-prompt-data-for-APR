The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotation marks around the property value when constructing the command list from the input dictionary.

The cause of the bug can be traced to how the `value` from the dictionary is handled. If the value is a string, it should not be enclosed in double quotes, but the current implementation is adding double quotes around the entire property=value pair.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_dict_arg` function to handle string values without adding double quotes and only add double quotes if the value is not a string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            formatted_value = '"{}"'.format(val) if not isinstance(val, str) else val
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, formatted_value)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function handles string values correctly and only adds double quotes if the value is not a string. It should pass the failing tests provided.
