The issue identified with the current `_dict_arg` function is that it adds quotation marks around the property-value pairs when creating the `command` list. This causes the failing tests to check for the presence of the quotation marks, which then leads to an assertion error.

To fix the bug, the quotation marks should be removed when adding the property-value pairs to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the quotation marks around the property-value pairs
    return command
```

The corrected `command` list produced by this function should now match the expected values in the failing tests.
