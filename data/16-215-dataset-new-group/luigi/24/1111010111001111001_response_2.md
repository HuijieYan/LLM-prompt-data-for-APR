The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the values from the input dictionary into the command list. It is missing the quotes around the key-value pairs, resulting in improper formatting.

To fix this, the values from the dictionary should be formatted as strings within double quotes before adding them to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
