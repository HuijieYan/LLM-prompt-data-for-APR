The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary input into a list of command line arguments. The bug occurs because the function is wrapping the values in double quotes, which results in an incorrect format when compared to the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the dictionary input into a list of command line arguments without unnecessary double quotes. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly format the dictionary input into a list of command line arguments without introducing unnecessary double quotes, thus passing the failing tests and satisfying the expected input/output values.
