The issue with the `_dict_arg` method is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. It is missing the quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` method to include the quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the method will correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list, including the quotes around the key-value pairs.

This should resolve the issue with the failing test cases.
