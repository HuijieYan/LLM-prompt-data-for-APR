In the given buggy function `_dict_arg`, the issue lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The problem is that it unnecessarily adds quotes around the value when creating the string, leading to the extra quotes in the output command list and causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the value in the string format.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The fix involves removing the additional quotes around the format `"{0}={1}"`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
