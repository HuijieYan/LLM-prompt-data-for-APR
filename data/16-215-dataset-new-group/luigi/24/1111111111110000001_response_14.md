Potential error within the buggy function
The _dict_arg function is meant to accept a dictionary and convert it into command like key-value pair. The error occurs when the buggy function attempts to build the command list, instead of appending the key-value pair to the command list, it appends a list that contains the key-value pairs.

Issues caused by the buggy function
The _dict_arg method is expected to only add the key and value to the command list, but this bug adds the key-value pair as string in a list, which is incorrect. Due to this, the failing test asserts a string object and an object of list data structure which causes the two outputs to be not equal.

Fix strategy
It should be guaranteed that the key-value pairs originating from the input `value` are directly added to the `command` list, rather than adding a list of key-value pairs for each value in the input dictionary `value`.

the corrected version
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, v in value.items():
                command += [name, prop, str(v)]
        return command
```
