The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it's not constructing the command list properly if `value` is a dictionary. Instead of appending the property and value to the command list, it's appending the name (e.g., `--conf`) for each property inside the dictionary.

To fix this, we need to iterate over the dictionary items and construct the command list by appending the correct property and value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name (e.g. prop_value) to avoid shadowing the outer value variable
            command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)])  # Use extend instead of += to add multiple elements to the list
    return command
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `command.extend` to add multiple elements to the `command` list for each property in the dictionary.
2. We change the variable name within the for loop from `value` to `prop_value` to avoid shadowing the outer `value` variable.

By making these changes, the corrected version should now construct the command list properly based on the properties and values in the dictionary. This should address the issues observed in the failing tests.
