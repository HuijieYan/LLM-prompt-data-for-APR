The issue with the buggy function is that it is overwriting the `value` variable inside the for loop, causing incorrect output. This is because the variable `value` is being reused for both the input parameter and as a loop variable, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to change the loop variable name so that it does not overwrite the input parameter `value`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the loop variable name to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name for the loop iteration (in this case, `val`), we prevent the overwriting of the input parameter `value` and ensure that the correct values are used in building the `command` list.

With this correction, the function should work correctly and produce the expected output for the given input parameters and runtime values.
