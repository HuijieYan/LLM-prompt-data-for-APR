The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a `name` and `value` as inputs, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. It then iterates through the dictionary and creates a `command` list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

The issue in the current implementation of the function is that it is adding double quotes to the property-value pairs, which is not needed and causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
