The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the value is being overwritten in the for loop, causing incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list. 

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the inner loop variable `value` to something else to avoid overwriting the input variable `value`.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # rename the inner loop variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
