From the runtime information and the failing tests, it seems that the buggy function `_dict_arg` is not assembling the command list properly when the input value is a dictionary. The bug is in the loop that processes the dictionary items and adds them to the command list.

The bug occurs in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

The problem is that the line is overwriting the initial value of `value` and `prop`, which causes the command list to not be constructed as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to change the variable names in the loop so that they don't overwrite the input parameter names. Also, we should remove the unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for k, v in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(k, v)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should assemble the command list correctly and pass the failing tests.
