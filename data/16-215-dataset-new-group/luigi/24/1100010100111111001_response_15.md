The bug in the _dict_arg function is in the line where the command list is constructed. The function is adding the name and value as separate elements to the command list, which is not the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding the name and value as separate elements to the command list, and in some cases, it is wrapping the value with double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function should construct each command entry as a single string, including the name, equals sign, and the value. If the value contains special characters or spaces, it should be enclosed in double quotes. Also, the function should handle cases where the input value is an empty dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            entry = "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)
            if ' ' in entry or ',' in entry:  # Check for special characters
                entry = '"{}"'.format(entry)
            command += [name, entry]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly construct the command list and pass the failing tests.
