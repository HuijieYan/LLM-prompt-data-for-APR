The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it doesn't handle the input dictionary correctly, leading to the incorrect formation of the `command` list.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to iterate through the input dictionary and construct the `command` list correctly with the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict with input parameter name
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove unnecessary quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
