The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is adding extra quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list, resulting in a format mismatch with the expected command list in the tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding extra double quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the command list. This causes the property-value pairs to be represented as strings with quotes in the resulting command list, which is not as expected in the tests.

To fix the bug, the function should construct the command list without adding extra quotes around the property-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version constructs the command list without adding extra quotes around the property-value pairs, resulting in the expected format defined in the tests.
