The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not correctly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary. Instead of constructing the command with the correct format, it is adding unnecessary quotes and equals sign within the loop.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _dict_arg function to properly construct the command list by removing the unnecessary quotes and equals sign.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """



    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly construct the command list when the input value is a dictionary, and it will not add unnecessary quotes or equals sign within the loop.
