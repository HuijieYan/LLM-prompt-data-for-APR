The error in the current code is while iterating through `value.items()`, it is overwriting the `value` variable. The corresponding tests are failing due to the presence of incorrect items in the `proc.call_args[0][0]` lists.

To fix the bug:
1- Change the variable name `value` inside the for loop to `val` in the `_dict_arg` function to prevent overwriting the current value.
2- Covert parameters to string by concatenating the string with list items.
3- Add missing imports for `luigi`.

The corrected version of the code:
```python
import luigi

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
  
    # Updated function without the bug
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command

```

After running the test on this corrected version, the failing test should now pass without any errors.
