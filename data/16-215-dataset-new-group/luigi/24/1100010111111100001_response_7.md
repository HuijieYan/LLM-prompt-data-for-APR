The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly formatting the command list when the input value is a dictionary. It is adding unnecessary double quotes and equals signs to the command.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly formatting the command list by adding unnecessary double quotes and equals signs when iterating through the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _dict_arg function to properly format the command list without adding unnecessary characters, and instead just join the property and value with an equals sign.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This updated version of the function should correctly format the command list without adding unnecessary characters, which should resolve the failing tests.
