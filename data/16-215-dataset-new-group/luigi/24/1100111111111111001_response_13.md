The bug in the `_dict_arg` function stems from the way it constructs the `command` list when the `value` is a dictionary. When looping through the items in the dictionary, it adds the `name` and the formatted `prop=value` as separate elements in the `command` list. However, the expected behavior is to combine them into a single string element in the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we need to update the way the `command` list is constructed. Instead of using separate elements for the `name` and the formatted `prop=value`, we should concatenate them into a single string and then add it to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command.append(f'{name} "{prop}={val}"')  # concatenate name, prop and val into a single string
    return command
```

With this correction, the buggy function should behave as expected, passing the failing tests and satisfying the expected input/output values.
