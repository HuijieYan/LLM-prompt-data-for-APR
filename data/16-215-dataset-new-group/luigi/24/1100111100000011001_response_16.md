## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Fixing the variable name "value" to "val" to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Fixing the variable name "value" to "val" to avoid conflict
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is caused by using the same variable name "value" in the for loop, which overwrites the original value of the function parameter. This results in incorrect values being appended to the "command" list.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name (e.g., "val") in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original value of the function parameter.

The corrected version of the function uses a different variable name "val" within the for loop to avoid the conflict with the function parameter "value". This ensures that the original value is preserved and the correct values are appended to the "command" list.
