The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it converts the dictionary items into strings with double quotes, which is not the expected behavior. The expected behavior is to have the key-value pairs in the form `key=value` without the double quotes. This is causing the failing tests due to the incorrect formatting of the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly handle the dictionary items and create the command list in the expected format.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly format the key-value pairs without using double quotes, which will satisfy the expected input/output values and make the failing tests pass.
