## Analysis
1. The function `_dict_arg` is supposed to generate a command from a dictionary. The input value should be checked if it is a dictionary. If it is, the function loops through the dictionary and adds the key-value pairs to the command. It then returns the command. There is an existing bug here because the code concatenates strings instead of what `type` would identify. 

2. The root cause of the issue is the actual value of the dictionary being passed to the `_dict_arg` method and the complete parameter that would be added to the command line.

## Identifying potential error location
We found that the potential bug is in the `_dict_arg` method due to the incorrect handling of the dictionary while constructing the command. When adding key-value pairs to the command, it should not be placed in double quotations as a whole.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that instead of extracting the actual `property=value` pairs from the dictionary, the code wraps each property=value pair in double quotations, causing issues when trying to execute the command with the resulting list.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the code should construct the command properly, meaning that dictionary properties should be added as `property=value` without double quotation. 


The corrected version of the function should be as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

This updated code will correctly add the items to `command` without double quotations and resolve the issue. This change preserves the type of each value in the list, which was incorrect in the original code.
