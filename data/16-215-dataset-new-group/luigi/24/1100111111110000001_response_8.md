The current _dict_arg function tries to create a command line argument sequence by iterating over a Python dictionary with a for-loop. The failure in the buggy function is caused by a discrepancy between the expected call list of `proc.call_args[0][0]` and the actual list due to the use of additional double quotes around certain values. 

The issue arises from the use of double quotes intentionally to create a string representation in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line. This creates strings that are not aligned with the expected sequence. This happens because the function produces wrongly formatted arguments for the command.

To fix this bug, we need to avoid wrapping value with quotes in the command sequence. This can be achieved by adjusting the _dict_arg function to ensure that it correctly creates the command sequence based on the dictionary elements. This modified version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, v)]
    return command
```

The changes include the use of `v` inside the for-loop to avoid mistakenly wrapping the value with additional quotes when adding it to the command list. With this, the function will correctly format the command list as a sequence of strings without additional quotes around the dictionary values. After applying this change, the updated _dict_arg function should be able to pass the failing tests.
