The issue with the buggy function is that it is reusing the variable name "value" in the loop, which overwrites the original "value" input parameter. This causes incorrect values to be added to the "command" list, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration to avoid overwriting the original "value" input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Renamed the variable to prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

In this corrected version, I renamed the variable inside the loop to "prop_value" to avoid overwriting the original "value" input parameter. This ensures that the correct values are added to the "command" list, resolving the bug.
