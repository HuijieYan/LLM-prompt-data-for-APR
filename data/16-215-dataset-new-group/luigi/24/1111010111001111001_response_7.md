The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into a list of command arguments. It is currently using double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is incorrect. Additionally, the function is not properly handling the case when the value is empty.

The expected behavior of the function is to take the input `value`, which is a dictionary, and convert it into a list of command arguments, where each key-value pair is formatted as `name=prop`.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the dictionary items and format them correctly, handling the case when the value is empty.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflict with the input parameter
            if val:  # Check if the value is not empty
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Correctly format key-value pairs
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly format the dictionary values into a list of command arguments.
