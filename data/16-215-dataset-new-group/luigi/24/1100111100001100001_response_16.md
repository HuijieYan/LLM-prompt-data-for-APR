The bug in the provided function `_dict_arg` is that it is overwriting the `value` variable inside the for loop, which is causing the incorrect output.

The line `for prop, value in value.items():` is causing the issue because it is reusing the variable name `value` which was originally the input parameter of the function. This overwrites the original `value` with the inner value of the loop, causing incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to change the variable name in the for loop to something else to avoid overwriting the original `value` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable val instead of value
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly construct the `command` list without overwriting the original `value` parameter.
