The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the use of double quotes around the property-value pair when constructing the `command` list. This causes the assert statements in the failing tests to fail because the expected command list does not match the actual command list due to the different string representations of the property-value pair.

To fix the bug, the double quotes should be removed when constructing the property-value pair in the `command` list.

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change variable name to val to avoid shadowing the value parameter
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # remove double quotes
    return command
```
