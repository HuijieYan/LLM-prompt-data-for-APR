Analysis:
The buggy function _dict_arg takes in a name and a value as input, checks if the value is a dictionary, and then iterates through the dictionary to generate a command using the name and the key-value pairs of the dictionary.

The potential error in this function is that it reuses the variable name for iterating through the dictionary, which overwrites the input parameter name. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect command generation.

Cause of the bug:
The bug could cause unexpected behavior because the variable name, which is an input parameter, is being reused as an iteration variable. This could result in the value of name being overwritten with the last key in the dictionary, which is not the intended behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, use a different variable name for the iteration through the dictionary to avoid overwriting the input parameter name. This will ensure that the command is generated correctly based on the input dictionary.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, value in value.items():  # Use a different variable for iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the input parameter name will no longer be affected by the loop, and the command generation will be based on the correct values from the input dictionary.
