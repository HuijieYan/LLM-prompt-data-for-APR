The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly appending the key-value pairs from the dictionary to the `command` list. It is not adding the key-value pairs in the format expected by the caller of this function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the dictionary before adding them to the `command` list. Instead of using the format `"{prop}={value}"`, it is using `"{0}={1}"`, which is not the expected format.

To fix the bug, the function should properly format the key-value pairs as strings in the format `"{prop}={value}"` before adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
