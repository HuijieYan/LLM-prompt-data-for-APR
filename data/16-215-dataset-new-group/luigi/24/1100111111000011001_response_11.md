## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
    return command
```

By changing the variable name from `value` to `val` inside the for loop, we can avoid conflict with the input parameter `value`. This will ensure that the correct values are being used to construct the `command` list.

The corrected function should pass the failing test cases provided.
