The cause of the bug is that the function is using the same variable name "value" for both the input parameter and the loop variable inside the for loop, which is causing the values to be overwritten. Also, unnecessary double quotes are being added around the property-value pairs in the command list.

To fix the bug, we should use a different variable name for the loop variable and remove the unnecessary double quotes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
