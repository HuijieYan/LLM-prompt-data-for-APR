The problem in the `dict_arg` function is that if the value is a string, then the ` if value and isinstance(value, dict): ` condition directly fails and doesn't enter the loop. So we must accommodate for value being a string and modify the condition to check if the type of value is a string or a dictionary and adjust the loop accordingly.

Here's the buggy function fixed:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and (isinstance(value, dict) or isinstance(value, str)):
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        else:
            prop, val = value.split('=', 1)
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With these changes, the `dict_arg` function should now correctly process both dictionary input and string input. After these changes, the failing test should pass.
