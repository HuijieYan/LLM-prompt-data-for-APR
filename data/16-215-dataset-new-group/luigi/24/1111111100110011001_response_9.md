The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly handling the dictionary value. It is not processing the key-value pairs correctly and is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property value.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes when creating the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This fixed version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
