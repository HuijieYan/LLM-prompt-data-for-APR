```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

Explanation:
The buggy function fails because it incorrectly constructs the command list for the given input dictionary. It adds unnecessary double quotes around the property values and does not include the '--' prefix for each property. This leads to the failing test cases as the expected values do not match the actual values returned by the function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property values.
2. Include the '--' prefix for each property in the command list.

Updated code:
The updated code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This updated code should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected command list for the given input dictionary.
