The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the inner loop variable `value` is being re-assigned, which causes the function to not behave as intended. When the function iterates through the input `value` dictionary, it is using the same variable name `value` for the key-value pairs, which overwrites the original `value` parameter.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use a different variable name for the key-value pairs during the iteration, so that it doesn't conflict with the original `value` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from prop to key and value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

By using different variable names for the key-value pairs within the loop, the function will now correctly build the command list and return the expected value for the given input parameters.
