## Fixing the bug
The buggy function is intended to create a command list based on a dictionary input, but it is incorrectly adding double quotes around both the property and value in the command list. This is causing the test to fail, as the expected command list does not have double quotes around the property value pairs.

The fix involves removing the double quotes when constructing the command list.

## The corrected function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes here
    return command
```
