The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` is incorrectly formatting the dictionary values as strings in the command list.

In the first error message, the `proc` function is expecting a list of arguments as defined in the test, and the actual value being passed differs after `--conf` because the `_dict_arg` function adds quotes around the property value, e.g., `'"Prop=Value"'` instead of `Prop=Value`. 

In the second error message, the `proc` function is expecting a list of arguments as defined in the test, and the actual value being passed differs after `--conf` in a similar way.

To fix this bug, the quotes need to be removed from the formatted string `"{0}={1}"` in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
