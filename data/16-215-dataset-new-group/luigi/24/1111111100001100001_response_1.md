The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to process a dictionary input and create a command list based on its key-value pairs. However, the issue lies in the way the key-value pairs are being handled.

The bug is caused by using the same variable name "value" for both the input and an iteration variable. This leads to incorrect processing of the input dictionary. Additionally, unnecessary double-quoting of the key-value pairs is also causing issues in the command list.

To fix the bug, we should use different variable names for the input dictionary and the iteration variable. We should also remove the unnecessary double-quoting of the key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the iteration
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double-quoting
        return command
```

In this corrected version, we use `val` as the iteration variable name to differentiate it from the input value. We also removed the double-quoting of the key-value pairs, resulting in a correct command list. This should fix the bug and ensure the proper processing of the input dictionary.
