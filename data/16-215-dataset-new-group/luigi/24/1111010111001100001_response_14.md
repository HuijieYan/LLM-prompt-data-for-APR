The cause of the bug is that the _dict_arg function is not properly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary. It is also not handling the case where the value is not a dictionary.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function should first check if the value is a dictionary. If it is, it should iterate through the dictionary and construct the command list. If it is not a dictionary, it should return an empty list. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the value is None.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is None:
        return command
    elif isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
