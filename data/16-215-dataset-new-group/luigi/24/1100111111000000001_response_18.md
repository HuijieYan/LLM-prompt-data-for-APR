The issue with the `_dict_arg` function seems to be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The problem is that the `name` and `value` variables are being overwritten for each iteration of the loop.

To correct this, we can rename the variable `value` inside the loop to something else, so it doesn't overwrite the original `value` parameter. Let's call it `v` for clarity.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():  # Change variable name to 'v'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)]  # Use 'v' instead of 'value'
    return command
```
