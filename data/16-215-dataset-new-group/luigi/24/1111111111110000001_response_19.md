The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the `SparkSubmitTask` class and it is expected to generate a command line argument based on a dictionary. The method iterates through the key-value pairs of the input dictionary and forms a command line argument list. The bug is that each key-value pair should be appended with the `name` but the buggy function appends only the value with the `name` resulting in incorrect command line generation.

The failing test cases show that the cause of the bug lies in using `"{0}={1}"` format to generate the command line argument, and thus creating an incorrect list of arguments. Additionally, it also demonstrates the issue of mismatched lists that differ in terms of presence of double quotes around the values.

In order to fix the bug, the format of the argument generation has to be corrected where `name` should be appended before `"{0}={1}"` and also the usage of string concatenation using `+=` should be avoided since it can lead to inefficient string creation.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{}={}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With the corrected version, the function will join the `name` with each `prop` and format it to form a new argument string directly.
