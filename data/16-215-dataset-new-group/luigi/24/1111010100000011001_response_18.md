The cause of the bug in the _dict_arg function is that the variable "value" is being reused for both the input value and the value of the dictionary items in the loop, causing it to be overwritten. Additionally, unnecessary double quotes are added to the command list.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name for the value of the dictionary items and remove the unnecessary double quotes from the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the value of the dictionary items
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will properly construct the command list based on the input dictionary, and it should satisfy the expected input/output values for both test cases.
