The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary. Instead of adding the key-value pairs as separate elements in the `command` list, it should add them as a single string in the format `"key=value"`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the key-value pairs are added to the `command` list. We can use the `join` function to create a string in the format `"key=value"` for each key-value pair in the input dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command += [f'{name}="{k}={v}"' for k, v in value.items()]
    return command
```

This corrected version should properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary, satisfying the expected input/output values and passing the failing test cases.
