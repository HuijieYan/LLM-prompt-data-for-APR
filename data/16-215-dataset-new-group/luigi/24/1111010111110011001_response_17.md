## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Corrected: Changed variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Corrected: Removed quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

The buggy function `_dict_arg` is failing to correctly parse dictionary input and generate the expected list of command arguments. This is leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, I would propose the following changes:
1. Change the variable name `value` in the for loop to `val` to avoid conflicts with the function parameter `value`.
2. Remove the quotes around `{0}={1}` to ensure that the key-value pairs are added without additional quotes.

The corrected function should now properly handle the input dictionary and generate the expected command arguments.

All the failing test cases should now pass with the corrected function.
