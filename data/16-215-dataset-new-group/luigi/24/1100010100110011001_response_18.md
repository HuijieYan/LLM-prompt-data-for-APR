## The fixed version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use val instead of value
    return command
```

Explanation:
The issue with the original code is that it uses the same variable name "value" for the outer parameter and the inner loop, which causes a conflict. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect output. By using a different variable name "val" in the inner loop, we can avoid this conflict and ensure that the correct values are used to construct the command list.

In the corrected version, I changed the inner loop variable name to "val" and used it instead of "value" inside the loop to construct the command list.

By making this change, the function will now correctly construct the command list with the expected values.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
