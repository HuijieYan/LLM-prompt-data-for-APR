The root cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is adding quotes around the property and value pairs in the command list, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the quotes need to be removed from around the properties and values when adding them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed quotes from around prop and val
    return command
```

By removing the quotes, the function will now generate the expected command list without extra quotes. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
