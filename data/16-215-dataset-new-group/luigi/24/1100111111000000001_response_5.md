The issue in the _dict_arg function is that it is overwriting the 'value' variable in the for loop, leading to incorrect data being appended to the 'command' list. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By changing the variable name 'value' inside the for loop to 'val', we prevent it from overwriting the function parameter 'value' and ensure that the correct data is appended to the 'command' list.

This correction should address the bug and allow the function to correctly process the dictionary argument and build the 'command' list as expected.
