## A corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name 'value' to 'val' to avoid confusion with the function parameter
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Remove the double quotes around {0}={1} to match expected output
    return command
```

Explanation:
1. The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly appending the dictionary key-value pairs to the command list with extra double quotes around the property and value. This is causing the assertion errors.
2. The cause of the bug is that the function is appending the dictionary key-value pairs with extra double quotes, which does not match the expected output.
3. To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes and change the variable name from 'value' to 'val' inside the for loop to avoid confusion with the function parameter name.
4. By making these changes, the corrected function should now correctly append the dictionary key-value pairs to the command list without extra double quotes and match the expected output.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided above.
