The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly adds extra double quotes around the property-value pair in the command list. This leads to a mismatch when comparing the expected output with the actual output in the failing tests. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the property-value pair when adding them to the command list.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
