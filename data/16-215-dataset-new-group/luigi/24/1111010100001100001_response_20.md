The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it is not handling the case where the value is empty. When the value is empty, the function should return an empty list. Additionally, the function is using the same variable `value` for both the input parameter and the loop variable, which is causing confusion and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Check if the value is empty, and if so, return an empty list.
2. Use a different variable name for the loop variable to avoid confusion and incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With these changes, the function should now handle empty values correctly and use a distinct variable for the loop, which will prevent confusion and lead to correct results.
