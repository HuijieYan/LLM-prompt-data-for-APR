The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the `name` parameter is not being used in the command list. In both cases, the `name` parameter is supposed to be added to the command list along with the property-value pair, but it's not being included.

The buggy function `_dict_arg` is creating a command list based on the input name and value. However, it is not including the name in the command list as expected. This is evident from the runtime values and types of variables right before the function's return in both cases, where the `name` parameter is not included in the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we should include the `name` parameter in the `command` list along with the property-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the `name` parameter is added to the `command` list along with the property-value pair.
