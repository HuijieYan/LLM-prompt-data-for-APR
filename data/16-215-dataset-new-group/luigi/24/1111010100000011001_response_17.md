The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using the same variable name `value` in the for loop and also as a parameter of the function. This is causing the value parameter to be overwritten within the for loop, resulting in incorrect command generation.

To fix this, we can rename the loop variable to something else so that it does not conflict with the `value` parameter. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renamed the loop variable to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly generate the command list based on the input parameters, and satisfy the expected input/output values.
