The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is incorrectly adding double quotes around the value when creating the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command list.

To fix the bug, remove the double quotes when formatting the value in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
