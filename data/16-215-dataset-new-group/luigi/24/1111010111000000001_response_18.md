Based on the provided context, it seems like the buggy function `_dict_arg` is used to generate command-line arguments for a Spark job in the Luigi task `SparkSubmitTask`. The function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command-line arguments, but it has a bug that prevents it from working correctly.

The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is the line that appends the formatted key-value pair to the `command` list. The bug occurs because the value should not be enclosed in double quotes when constructing the command list.

The cause of the bug can be identified from the failing tests. The failing tests aim to verify that the command-line arguments are correctly constructed from the dictionary values and that the resulting list matches the expected list of arguments.

To fix the bug, the strategy is to modify the line where the key-value pair is appended to the `command` list in the `_dict_arg` function. The value should not be enclosed in double quotes to ensure that the resulting command list is constructed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Fix: Remove double quotes around val
    return command
```

With this modification, the `_dict_arg` function should be able to correctly construct the command-line arguments from the dictionary values, resolving the bug and causing the failing test to pass.
