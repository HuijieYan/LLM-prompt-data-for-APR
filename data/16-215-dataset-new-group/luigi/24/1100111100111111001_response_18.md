The problem with the buggy function is that it is adding extra double quotes around the values when creating the command list. This is causing the failing tests as they expect the values to be formatted differently. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes added around the values in the command list creation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed extra double quotes
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly construct the command list without adding extra double quotes around the values, and the failing tests should pass.
