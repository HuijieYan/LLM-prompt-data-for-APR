Based on the error messages, it seems that the bug is related to how the `_dict_arg` function is processing dictionary values into a list of command arguments. The `_dict_arg` function is designed to convert a dictionary into a list of command arguments, but it is not handling string values in the dictionary correctly. When a string value is present in the dictionary, the function mistakenly encloses it within double quotes, leading to command arguments that are not formatted correctly.

To fix this bug, the strategy would be to modify the `_dict_arg` function so that it does not wrap string values in double quotes. The correct approach would be to wrap only the key-value pairs in the format `key=value` inside the argument list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                # If val is a string, directly append the key-value pair without quotes
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
            else:
                # If val is not a string, format the value as per the original implementation
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version should resolve the incorrect handling of string values in the dictionary, and the failing tests should pass once this version is used.
