The buggy function `_dict_arg` is not handling the dictionary input value correctly. It is not formatting the key-value pairs properly into the command list.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not iterating through the dictionary items correctly and not formatting the key-value pairs as expected in the command list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly iterate through the dictionary items and format the key-value pairs into the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary and generate the correct command list.

The corrected function should be able to pass the failing tests.
