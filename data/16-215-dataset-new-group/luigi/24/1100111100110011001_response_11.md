The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly formatting the command list when `value` is a dictionary. It is adding each key-value pair as a separate item in the list, and also adding unnecessary quotes around the values.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect formatting of the command list with unnecessary quotes.
2. Overwriting the `value` variable in the loop with the inner for loop.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly constructing the command list from the dictionary input, and it is also using the same variable name `value` for both the outer and inner loop, causing the outer `value` to be overwritten.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly construct the command list from the dictionary input, without adding unnecessary quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
