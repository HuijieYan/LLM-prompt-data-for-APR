The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that the variable `value` is being reused as a loop variable, which may cause unexpected behavior. Additionally, the string formatting for the command list may not be correct.

The cause of the bug is that the same variable `value` is being used for the input value and as a loop variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially overwrite the original `value`.

To fix the bug, we can rename the loop variable from `value` to something else to avoid confusion and use proper string formatting for the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
