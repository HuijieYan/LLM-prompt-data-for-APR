The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into a list of commands. It is missing the quotation marks around the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted correctly with quotation marks and added to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed variable name from value to val to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # formatted the key-value pair with quotation marks
    return command
```

With this correction, the `_dict_arg` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
