The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the reassignment of the `value` parameter from the loop iteration to something else. This will cause incorrect command concatenation and will result in the incorrect command being returned. To fix this bug, we should use a different variable to store the loop iteration value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change variable name from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the `_dict_arg` function should now work correctly without any issues.

The failing test should now pass.
