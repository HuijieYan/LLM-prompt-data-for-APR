The issue with the buggy function is that it re-uses the variable name 'value' in the for loop, which overwrites the input 'value' for the function. To fix this, we can simply rename the loop variable to something else to avoid this conflict.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # renamed 'value' to 'prop_value'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```
