## Corrected Version

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  #changed value to val to avoid variable name conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  #removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is due to the use of the same variable name "value" inside the for loop, causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, unnecessary quotes were added to the command list. These issues caused the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we renamed the inner variable to "val" inside the for loop to avoid the conflict with the input parameter "value". We also removed the unnecessary quotes around the formatted string in the list concatenation.

The corrected version should now properly handle the input parameters and return the expected output.
