The bug in the function is that it incorrectly formats the values in the dictionary as part of the command list. It should be adding the key-value pairs as a single string with the format `"key=value"`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is adding the key-value pairs as separate elements in the command list, with quotes around the value, which is not the expected format.

To fix the bug, the function should generate the command list by formatting the key-value pairs as strings in the format `"key=value"` and appending them to the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + '="{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
