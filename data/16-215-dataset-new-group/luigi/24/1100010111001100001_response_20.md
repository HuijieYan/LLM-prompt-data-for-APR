The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not handling the dictionary input correctly. It is not constructing the command list properly and is not handling the key-value pairs in the dictionary as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not iterating through the dictionary items correctly. Instead of adding the key-value pairs as separate elements, it is adding the entire key-value pair as a single string element.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly iterate through the dictionary items and construct the command list with the key-value pairs separated.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list with key-value pairs separated by '='. This should resolve the bug and make the failing tests pass.
