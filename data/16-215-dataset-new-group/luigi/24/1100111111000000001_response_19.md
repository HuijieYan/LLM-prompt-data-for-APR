The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not generating the correct command list based on the dictionary of arguments provided. The test functions `test_run` and `test_defaults` are failing because they are expecting specific command lists to be generated, but the `_dict_arg` function is not formulating them accurately.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function needs to be modified to correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name from value to val to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '--{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Used -- as the prefix for each property
    return command
```

By making these changes, the `_dict_arg` function will now correctly generate the command list based on the input dictionary, which should make the test functions `test_run` and `test_defaults` pass.
