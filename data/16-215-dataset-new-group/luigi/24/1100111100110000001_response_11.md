The buggy function `_dict_arg` produces unexpected output resulting in a failure of the test cases. The bug is in the `for` loop, where it is appending a tuple instead of a list to `command` list. This resulting in mismatch between expected and actual outputs in the test cases.

To fix the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, the code within the `for` loop needs to be modified. Instead of appending the tuple to the `command` list, it should extend the list. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, v in value.items():  # modified the variable name to avoid conflict with the function input variable name
            command.extend([name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, v)])  # extend the command list rather than appending a tuple
    return command
```
