Potential errors in the `_dict_arg` function:
1. The function is not properly appending the name and value in the `command` list.
2. The loop iterates through the `value` dictionary but the inner loop variable `value` overwrites the outer loop variable `value`.
3. The formatting of the command is incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The `_dict_arg` function is supposed to iterate over the `value` dictionary and construct a command list with formatted strings, but it is not doing so correctly. This causes the test cases to fail as the constructed command does not match the expected command.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly iterate over the `value` dictionary and construct the command list with the proper formatting.
2. Ensure that the formatting of the command list matches the expected command from the failing test cases.

Corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Use different variable to avoid overwriting
                command += [name, '--conf', f'"{prop}={val}"']  # Correctly construct the command
        return command
```
In the corrected version, the loop iterates over the `value` dictionary, and the command list is correctly constructed with the proper formatting to match the expected command from the failing test cases.
