The `dict_arg` function is intended to convert a dictionary into a list of command options that can be used for Spark submission. The bug is that it wraps the property values with double quotes, when it should not.

The failing tests are failing due to differences in list elements where string values are being enclosed in double quotes. This indicates that the function `_dict_arg` is adding the double quotes to the values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version of the function, the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` has been changed to `command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]` to remove addition of double quotes around the property values.
