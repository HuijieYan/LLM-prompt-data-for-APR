## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with test code:
The `_dict_arg` function is intended to create a command from a dictionary of key-value pairs. It is used within the `TestSparkSubmitTask` and `TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask` classes in the test file `spark_test.py` to generate the command for running a Spark job.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function seems to be in the way the command list is populated using the dictionary key-value pairs.

## Cause of the bug using the buggy function and the failing test:
The bug could be due to how the command list is being constructed from the dictionary of key-value pairs. This could result in missing or incorrectly formatted command elements, causing the tests to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `_dict_arg` function needs to iterate through the dictionary and build the command list in a way that accurately represents the key-value pairs and their respective formatting.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Using val instead of value to avoid name conflict
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Adjusted the formatting of the command elements
    return command
```

In the corrected version above, the command list is built using the `name`, `prop`, and `val` from the dictionary in a way that accurately represents the key-value pairs and their formatting.

By using "--" for each key-value pair, the corrected version ensures that the command list is constructed correctly and matches the expectations of the test cases.
