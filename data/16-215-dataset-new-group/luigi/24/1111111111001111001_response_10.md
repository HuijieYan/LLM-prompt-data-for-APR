The bug in the `_dict_arg` function causes the incorrect formatting of command to pass to subprocess.Popen. The expected format for each item in the command list is `name="value"`. 

The bug is in the line:
```python
command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
```

This line is incorrectly placing the entire key-value pair inside double quotes, when only the value should be in quotes.

To fix the bug, the line should be modified to correctly format the command list as:
```python
command += [f'{name}={prop}="{value}"']
```
This change ensures that the argument is formatted as `name="prop=value"`, as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [f'{name}={prop}="{val}"']
    return command
```
