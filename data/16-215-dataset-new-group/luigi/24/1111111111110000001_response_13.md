The problem lies in the `_dict_arg` method, where it constructs a command by processing a dictionary argument. The issue is that instead of directly adding the property name and value to the `command` list, it wraps the value with quotes which causes the assertion to fail when run with the provided tests.

1. The tests provided in the `contrib/spark_test.py` file are attempting to assert the results of the simulated execution of subprocess calls.
2. The issue arises from the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class.
3. Given the outputs of the tests, the error is due to the incorrect construction of command lists. The failing assertions highlight that there are differences in the constructed command elements caused by the formatting of the properties. This shows direct indication about the issue and the source is the `_dict_arg` method.
4. To fix the issue, the `_dict_arg` function should construct the command list for proper handling of dictionary elements without wrapping the values in quotes.
5. A corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function is provided below:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Construct the correct command without quotes around the values
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the failing tests should now pass successfully.
