### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to take a name and a dictionary of properties and values, and format them into a command list. However, in its current state, the function is not handling the dictionary properly. Instead of creating a key-value pair in the format `prop=value`, it is adding unnecessary quotation marks and an equal sign. This is evident from the runtime values and types of variables being incorrect in the return.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the dictionary key-value pairs are formatted in the `command` list. We should remove the unnecessary quotation marks and equal sign so that the command list is correctly formatted for use in the Spark job.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
