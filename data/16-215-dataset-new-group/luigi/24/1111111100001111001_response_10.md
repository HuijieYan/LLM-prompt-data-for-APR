The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary values in the command list. It is currently adding extra double quotes around the key-value pairs, which is not necessary. 

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes and also ensure that the key-value pairs are concatenated with an equal sign.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
