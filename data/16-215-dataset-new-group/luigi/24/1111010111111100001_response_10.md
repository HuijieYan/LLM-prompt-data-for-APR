## Fixing the bug

The bug arises from the `_dict_arg` function creating quotes around the property-value pairs when constructing the `command` list. This results in the list containing string elements with redundant quotes that cause the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the property-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items(): # Changed variable name from value to val
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)] # Removed quotes around {0}={1}
        return command
```
