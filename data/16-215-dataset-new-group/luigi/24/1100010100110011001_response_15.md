# The buggy function

The `_dict_arg` function is intended to take a dictionary `value` and convert it into a list of command line arguments based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, the bug appears to be related to the way the function handles the values from the dictionary.

## Identified potential error locations
The error seems to be related to the way the function formats the dictionary key-value pairs into command line arguments.

## Cause of the bug
The bug seems to be caused by the function formatting the dictionary key-value pairs in an incorrect format, specifically with the addition of extra double quotes around the values.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from around the values in the command list.

## The corrected function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
