The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that when building the `command` list, it incorrectly includes the property and value in separate quotes when they are already encapsulated in quotes. This causes the assertion errors in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the value is a string and if so, keep the key-value pair together and add it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will address the issue causing the assertion errors in the failing tests.
