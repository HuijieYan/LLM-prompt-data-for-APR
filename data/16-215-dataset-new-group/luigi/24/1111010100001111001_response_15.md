The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the key-value pairs when building the `command` list. This causes the output to be formatted incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected output for the given input cases.
