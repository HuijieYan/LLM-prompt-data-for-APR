Based on the analysis, it appears that the bug lies in the `_dict_arg` function where it incorrectly formats the dictionary key-value pairs. The key-value pairs are not being formatted as expected, resulting in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs as specified in the expected values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the function will correctly format the dictionary key-value pairs, and the failing tests are expected to pass.

This corrected version ensures that the key-value pairs are properly formatted as strings within the list, as expected in the failing tests.

After applying this correction, the failing tests should pass.
