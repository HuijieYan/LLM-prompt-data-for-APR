The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by incorrectly adding quotes to the value of the dict items when constructing the command list. This leads to the AssertionError in the failing tests since the expected and actual command lists have different formats.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly construct the command list without unnecessary quotes, and the failing tests should pass.
