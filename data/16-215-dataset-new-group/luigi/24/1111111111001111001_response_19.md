The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary items into strings before appending them to the `command` list. When the `value` is a dictionary, the function should iterate through its items and format each key-value pair as a string before adding it to the `command` list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_dict_arg` function to properly format the dictionary items as strings before appending them to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly format the dictionary items as strings and append them to the `command` list. This should now pass the failing test cases provided.
