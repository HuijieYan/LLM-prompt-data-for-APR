The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is mostly likely being caused by not properly formatting the elements of the `value` dictionary into the `command` list, causing issues when the command list is used to build the command string.

From the two failing tests, it is clear that the _dict_arg function is expected to process a dictionary of arguments and correctly format them for command. It is not properly handling the quote characters and producing incorrect formatted results. The failing test messages explicitly show that there is an issue with the quotes around the values from the dictionary.

In order to fix the bug, the _dict_arg function needs to properly handle quote characters when formatting the command list. One way to resolve this would be to use a different approach for constructing the command list such as using shlex.quote for each value when formatting command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import shlex

def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, shlex.quote("{0}={1}".format(prop, value))]
    return command
```
In this corrected version, `shlex.quote` method is used to properly quote each value when adding the pair to the command list. This should ensure that the quotes around the values are handled correctly, which will resolve the issues observed in the failing tests.
