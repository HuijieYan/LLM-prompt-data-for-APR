The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the command list when creating a command for a dictionary input value. It is missing the quotes around the property-value pair. 

To fix this bug, we should update the function to properly format the property-value pair with quotes. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)] # corrected this line
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should properly format the property-value pair with quotes, allowing it to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
