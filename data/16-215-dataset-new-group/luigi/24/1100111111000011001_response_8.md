## Analysis
The `_dict_arg` function is expected to take a `name` and `value` as input and process the `value` if it is a dictionary. The function should iterate through the dictionary and construct a command list where each item is constructed as `"{name}={value}"`. However, there are issues with the construction of the command list and the way the `value` and `prop` are being extracted from the dictionary.

## Bug
The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the construction of the command list. The implementation of the loop to iterate through the dictionary and construct the command list is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output when the function is called with the given dictionary input.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the implementation of the loop that constructs the command list should be modified to correctly extract the `prop` and `value` from the dictionary and construct the command list items as `"{name}={value}"`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
