## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The Relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # This is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():  # Used val instead of "value"
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed extra quotes
        return command
```

Explanation:
- In the original function, the use of the same variable name "value" as both the function argument and within the for loop caused confusion.
- Additionally, the unnecessary quotes around the property and value pairs inside the dict were causing the output to be in an incorrect format.

By fixing the function and removing the unnecessary quotation marks, the function should now work correctly.
