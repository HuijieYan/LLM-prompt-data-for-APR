## Correction

The buggy function is intended to take a name and a dictionary of key-value pairs as input, and then create a command list based on the key-value pairs. However, the bug occurs when the function overwrites the variable 'value' with the loop variable in the for loop, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can change the loop variable name from 'value' to something else, such as 'val', so that it does not overwrite the input parameter 'value'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases provided.
