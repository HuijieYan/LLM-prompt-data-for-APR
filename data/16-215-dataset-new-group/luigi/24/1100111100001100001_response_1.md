The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that the value for each key-value pair of the input dictionary is being enclosed in double quotes. This is not the correct format for command line arguments in some scenarios.

The cause of the bug is that the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` is adding the key-value pair in quotes, which is not appropriate for command line arguments.

To fix this bug, we should remove the double quotes around `{0}={1}` in the format string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list without enclosing the key-value pairs in quotes. The function will now return the expected result for the provided test cases.
