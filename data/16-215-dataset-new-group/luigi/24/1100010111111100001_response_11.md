The issue in the _dict_arg function is that it is incorrectly treating the dict values as strings, resulting in extra quotes around the property-value pairs when creating the command list. This explains the AssertionError message in the failing tests, where the expected and actual lists differ due to the presence of extra quotes.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function should handle the dictionary values properly, without adding extra quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the dictionary values and generate the command list without adding extra quotes. This should resolve the failing tests.
