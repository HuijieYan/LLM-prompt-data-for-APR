The root cause of the bug is that the implementation of the `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class is not generating the correct command list. The function is supposed to take a `name` and `value` as input, where the `value` is a dictionary. It should then generate a list of commands by iterating through the dictionary items and adding them to the command list.

The bug arises from the fact that the function is reusing the same variable `value` as the loop variable, causing the outer `value` to be overwritten. This leads to incorrect formatting and missing key-value pairs in the resulting command list.

To fix the bug, a new variable should be used inside the loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` variable. Also, the check for an empty dictionary should be added to handle the case when the input `value` dictionary is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val' within the loop
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_dict_arg` function should now generate the correct command list and pass the failing test cases.
