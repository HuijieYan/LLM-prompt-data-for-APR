The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the fact that the values in the dictionary are being surrounded by double quotes, which is causing the assertion errors in the test cases. This is evident from the difference between the expected and actual output where the dictionary values are surrounded by double quotes in the actual output.

To fix the bug, we should remove the double quotes around the property values in the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the property values in the `command` list, the bug causing the assertion errors in the failing test cases should be fixed.
