The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it wraps the value of the property in double quotes in the command list. This is causing the test cases to fail as the expected command list does not contain double quotes around the property value.

To fix this bug, the function should append the property and value to the command list without wrapping them in double quotes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from value to val to prevent conflict
            command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Updated format to include property and value without quotes
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
