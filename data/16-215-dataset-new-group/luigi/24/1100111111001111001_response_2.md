The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not properly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the command list. The function is currently taking each pair and adding it to the command list as a separate item, without properly formatting the key-value pairs as strings.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly format the key-value pairs as strings and then add them to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```

By using f-strings, we can easily format the key-value pairs as strings with the correct format and add them to the command list.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected results.
