First, analyzing the buggy function:

The buggy function is _dict_arg which accepts three parameters: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is a dictionary and, if so, iterates through its items to construct a command list. The issue could be related to the reassignment of the value variable inside the loop.

Identifying potential error locations:

The potential error is the reassignment of the "value" variable inside the for loop.

Cause of the bug:

The bug is caused by the reassignment of the "value" variable inside the loop. This reassignment causes incorrect values to be concatenated into the "command" list, leading to a malformed list.

Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, it's important to use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid reassigning the original "value" variable. This will ensure that the "command" list is constructed correctly.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the new variable name
    return command
```

By using a different variable name "val" inside the loop, we prevent the reassignment of the original "value" variable and ensure the correct construction of the "command" list.
