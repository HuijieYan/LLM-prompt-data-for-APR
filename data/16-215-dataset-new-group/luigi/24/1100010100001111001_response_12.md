The bug in the function is that it is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Explanation of the bug:
The function is iterating through the input dictionary `value` and adding each key-value pair to the `command` list with unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
