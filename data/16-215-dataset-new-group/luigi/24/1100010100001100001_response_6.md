The cause of the bug is that the function is using the same variable name "value" for both the input value and the loop value, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can simply rename the loop value variable to avoid the conflict.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # change the variable name from "value" to "val"
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # use the new variable name "val"
    return command
```
