The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding double quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list. This is causing the output to be formatted incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the double quotes when appending the key-value pairs to the `command` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version will output the correct format for the key-value pairs in the `command` list.
