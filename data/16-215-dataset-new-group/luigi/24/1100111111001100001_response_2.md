The issue with the buggy function is that it reuses the variable name "value" in the for loop, causing a conflict with the input parameter "value" of the function. This results in the incorrect processing of the input dictionary.

To fix this bug, the variable name in the for loop should be changed to avoid the conflict with the input parameter "value".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Changed variable names to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function should correctly process the input dictionary and generate the expected command list, passing the failing tests.
