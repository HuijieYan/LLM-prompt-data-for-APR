### The buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, the runtime input/output values.
The buggy function `_dict_arg` is a method of the class `SparkSubmitTask`, a template task for running a Spark job. The function is designed to take a `name` and `value` as input, where `value` is expected to be a dictionary. The function then constructs a command by iterating through the dictionary key-value pairs and formatting them as strings.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the formatting of the dictionary values correctly, resulting in an assertion error when comparing the expected command with the actual command generated by the function.

The runtime input/output values of the failing tests indicate that the function is not formatting the dictionary values consistently or as expected, resulting in differing elements when compared with the expected command.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error in the function lies in the formatting of the dictionary values. The use of `+=` to concatenate the command list with formatted strings may not be handling the values correctly, leading to inconsistencies in the resulting command list.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is improperly formatting the dictionary values when constructing the command list. In the first case, the value is enclosed in double quotes, and in the second case, it is not, leading to inconsistencies and assertion errors when comparing the expected and actual commands.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should consistently format the dictionary values without enclosing them in double quotes. This will ensure that the resulting command list is formatted correctly and matches the expected command.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quotes around the `{1}` in the format string, the corrected version of the function should now consistently format the command list without any extra characters, thereby resolving the bug.
