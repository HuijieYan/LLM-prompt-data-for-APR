The `_dict_arg` function takes in three parameters, `self`, `name`, and `value`, and then iterates through the dictionary `value` to create a list called `command`. Each key-value pair in the dictionary is formatted into a string and added to `command`. 

The error messages indicate that the function is expected to return a list of strings with formatting such as `'"prop1=val1"'`, but instead, it is returning some of these substrings unformatted as `prop1-val1`.

To fix this, we should remove the unnecessary quotation marks around the property and value in the concatenated strings.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
Once the function has been corrected, it should return lists with the correct formatting, thus passing the failing tests.
