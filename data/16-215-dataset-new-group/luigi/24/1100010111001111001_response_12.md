The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly appends the property-value pair to the `command` list. It adds double quotes around the property-value pair, which is unnecessary and causes the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes from the property-value pair before appending it to the `command` list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output values.
