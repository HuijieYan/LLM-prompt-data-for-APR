The issue with the current implementation of the _dict_arg function is that it is not correctly formatting the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list. The current implementation is not adding the key-value pairs in the expected format.

Based on the failing tests and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the format used for each key-value pair should be "key=value" instead of '"key=value"'. The existing implementation is adding unnecessary quotes around the key-value pairs.

To fix this bug, the implementation needs to be updated to remove the unnecessary quotes and generate the correct format for each key-value pair.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now properly format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary into the command list, and it should pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
