The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the use of unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair when appending it to the `command` list. This leads to the assertion errors in the failing tests.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pair when creating the command list.

Below is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass without assertion errors.
