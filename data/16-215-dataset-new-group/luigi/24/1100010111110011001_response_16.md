## The corrected version of the buggy function

# corrected function
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed 'value' to 'val' to fix the bug
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

By analyzing the failing tests and the corresponding error messages, it was identified that the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the incorrect formatting of argument values when building the `command` list.

The buggy function adds double quotes around the property and value in the command list, resulting in a mismatch with the expected values. This causes the tests to fail due to the incorrect formatting of the argument values in the `proc.call_args[0][0]` list.

To fix the bug, the double quotes should be removed and the variable representing the value in the loop should be renamed to avoid overwriting the function parameter. Additionally, the correction should include directly concatenating the property and value without any additional characters.

The corrected version of the function has been provided above, which fixes the bug and satisfies the expected input/output values for both test cases.
