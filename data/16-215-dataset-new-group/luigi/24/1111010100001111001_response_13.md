The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly formats the dictionary values. It is using double quotes around the key-value pairs inside the list, which is not the expected behavior. The function should create key-value pairs without the double quotes around the values.

To fix the bug, the `'"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)` line should be changed to `'{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)`. This will eliminate the unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```
