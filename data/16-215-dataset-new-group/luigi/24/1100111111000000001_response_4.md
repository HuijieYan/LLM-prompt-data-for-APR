The bug seems to be in the _dict_arg function within the luigi/contrib/spark.py file. The function is trying to build a command by iterating over a dictionary and adding the key-value pairs to the command list. However, the bug is likely occurring due to the usage of the same variable name "value" for iterating through the dictionary and the function argument.

This causes the original "value" passed to the function to be overwritten within the loop, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect command formation.

To fix the bug, the variable name used for iteration in the for loop should be different from the function argument name. For example, using "key, val" to iterate over the dictionary items, to avoid overwriting the original "value" argument.

Here's the corrected version of the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function should no longer overwrite the original "value" argument and build the command list correctly, passing the failing test.
