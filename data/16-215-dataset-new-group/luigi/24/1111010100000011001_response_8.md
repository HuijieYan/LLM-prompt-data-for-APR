The buggy function `_dict_arg` is intended to receive a `name` and a `value` as input parameters, and then build a list `command` by iterating through the dictionary `value`. The expected output is a list `command` with the format `['name', '"key=value"']`.

The potential error in the code is that the variable `value` is being used as both the input parameter and as an iterator variable in the `for` loop.

The cause of the bug is that the variable `value` is being overwritten in the for loop, leading to incorrect iteration and formatting of the command list.

To fix the bug, I will rename the iterator variable in the for loop to avoid overwriting the input parameter `value`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the iterator variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly build the `command` list based on the input `value` dictionary and return the expected values and types for the given test cases.
