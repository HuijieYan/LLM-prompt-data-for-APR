The bug is caused by the part of the function that formats the value inside the command list. It is currently adding double quotes around the value when it shouldn't. 

To fix the bug, the function should simply append the value without the double quotes to the command list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
