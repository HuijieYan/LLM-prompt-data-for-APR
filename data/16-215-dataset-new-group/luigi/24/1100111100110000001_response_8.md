The cause of the bug is that the `_dict_arg` function is adding extra quotes around the property values when constructing the `command` list, causing the elements of the `proc.call_args[0][0]` list to have mismatched formats. The extra quotes are a result of calling `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. 

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra quotes when formatting the property-value pair. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed unnecessary quotes
    return command
```

By removing the unnecessary double quoting around the `{0}={1}` format string, the corrected version will ensure that the property-value pairs are added to the `command` list without additional quotes. This should resolve the formatting differences in the failed test cases.
