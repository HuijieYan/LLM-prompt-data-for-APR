The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary values into a command list. The buggy function is using double quotes around the values, which is causing the assertion errors in the tests.

To fix this bug, the function should not add double quotes around the values in the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly generate the command list without the unnecessary double quotes, passing both failing tests and satisfying the expected input/output values.
