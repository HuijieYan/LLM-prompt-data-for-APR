The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it wraps the dictionary values with double quotes, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output in the test cases. The expected output does not include the double quotes in the key-value pairs of the dictionary.

To fix the bug, the double quotes should be removed when constructing the `command` list. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version will remove the unnecessary double quotes when constructing the `command` list, and it should now satisfy the expected input/output values of the test cases.
