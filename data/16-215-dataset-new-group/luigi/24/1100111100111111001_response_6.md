The cause of the bug is that the function is adding double quotes around the value when creating the command list, which is unnecessary and causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should create the command list without adding double quotes around the property-value pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
