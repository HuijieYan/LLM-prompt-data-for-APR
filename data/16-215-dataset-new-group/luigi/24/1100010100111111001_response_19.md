The cause of the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly adds quotes around the value when creating the command list. This causes the generated command list to contain extra quotes that are not expected, leading to a mismatch with the expected command list.

To fix the bug, we should remove the extra quotes around the values when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed variable name from 'value' to 'val'
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed the quotes around {0}={1}
    return command
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected command lists.
