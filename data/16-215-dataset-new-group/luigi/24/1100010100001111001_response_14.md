The problem in the buggy function is that it is adding unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs in the command list. This is causing the output to differ from the expected values in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary double quotes from the format string.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected output values in the provided test cases.
