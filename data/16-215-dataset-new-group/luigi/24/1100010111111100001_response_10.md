The issue with the current implementation is that the "value" part is being enclosed in double quotes within the command list, resulting in the test failures. It is supposed to be added as a key-value pair without the quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes around the value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming 'value' to 'val' to avoid conflicts
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removing unnecessary double quotes
    return command
```
