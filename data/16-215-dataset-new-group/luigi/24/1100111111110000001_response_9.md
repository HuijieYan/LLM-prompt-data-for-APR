The implemented `_dict_arg` function is doing some processing and appending the key and value into a list called `command`. This function should return a list after processing the input `value`, which is a given dictionary. However, the value is always wrapped with double quotes in the `command`. 

The failing tests suggest that the elements are not matching as expected, asserting that the final list should be the same as the one produced by the code being tested. The output comparison indicates a discrepancy in the formatted output. The failing assertions specifically express that the items in the list don't match the expected values due to the existence of double quotes within the list of strings. 

To fix the bug, we have to remove the double quotes added around values in the command list. Also, we need to improve variable naming to avoid naming conflict between function parameter `value` and loop variable in `for` loop.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(key, val))
    return command
```

The corrected function properly formats the values in the `command` list, and it should pass the failing tests.
