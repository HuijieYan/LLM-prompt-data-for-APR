The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it encloses a dictionary value in double quotes, leading to the failing tests and assertion errors for the test cases.

The cause of the bug:
The `_dict_arg` function is iterating through the keys and values of a dictionary, converting them into strings and appending them with quotes. This is resulting in duplicate double quotes being added to the command list, causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug:
Update the _dict_arg function so that it checks if a value is a string or not. If it's a string, the code should simply append the property and value in the expected format. If it's not a string, it should use the format method to add the property and value.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

Corrected version:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            if isinstance(val, str):
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
            else:
                command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This should resolve the issue as it ensures that the values are added to the command list in the required format.
