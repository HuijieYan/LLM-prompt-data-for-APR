The cause of the bug is the `_dict_arg` function not handling the case where a dictionary value is passed in without being stringified. When passing the `value` and `prop` to `command`, the given code wraps all non-strings with quotes (") regardless of their original type. When the test method attempts to verify if the command matches the anticipated list, it fails because of the mismatching of string formatting.

We can fix the bug by modifying the `_dict_arg` function to correctly handle all types within the expected input dictionary value. We will stringify the values only if they are not a string.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            final_prop_value = '"{0}"'.format(prop_value) if not isinstance(prop_value, str) else prop_value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, final_prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the `_dict_arg` function will handle different types of input values, correctly preserving strings and stringifying non-strings as necessary. As a result, it should pass the failing test cases.
