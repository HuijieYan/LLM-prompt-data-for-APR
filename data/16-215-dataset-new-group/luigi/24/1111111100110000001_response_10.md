There are many potential sources of error in the function `_dict_arg()`. The error message reveals that the function is not handling the dictionary values correctly. Specifically, it seems to be double-quoting the values when adding them to the `command` list. This is leading to issues with mismatched quotes and is causing the unequal list comparison error.

The suggestions for fixing the bug include removing the double-quoting of dictionary values and properly formatting the strings for the `command` list. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg()` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/spark.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def name(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job

    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn

    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]  # Create the correctly formatted string with '=' between property and value
        return command
```

The correction involves properly formatting the strings when adding them to the `command` list - the correct format is `--property=value`. This corrected version of the function should address the issues encountered in the failing tests.
