The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the dictionary key-value pairs into the `command` list. It is currently using string interpolation to include the key-value pairs inside double quotes, but it should be using single quotes. Additionally, the function is not handling cases where the `value` is empty or not a dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly format the key-value pairs and handle cases where the `value` input is empty or not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "'{0}={1}'".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will format the key-value pairs correctly and handle empty or non-dictionary `value` inputs. This should satisfy the expected input/output values for all the test cases.
