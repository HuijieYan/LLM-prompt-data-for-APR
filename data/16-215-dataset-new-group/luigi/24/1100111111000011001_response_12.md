The buggy function `_dict_arg` is supposed to take a dictionary `value` and create a list `command` based on its key-value pairs. However, it is not handling the values properly and is not generating the correct command list.

The issue is that the function reuses the variable name `value` inside the for loop, overwriting the original `value` parameter. This causes the function to use the inner `value` (which is the value of the dictionary) instead of the original `value` from the function parameters.

To fix this issue, we can simply use a different variable name inside the for loop to avoid overwriting the original `value` from the function parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this change, the function should now correctly generate the `command` list based on the input dictionary `value`. This corrected version of the function should satisfy the expected input/output values for both test cases provided.
