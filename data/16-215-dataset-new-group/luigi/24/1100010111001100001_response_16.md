The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the input dictionary properly and is not formatting the command list correctly.

To fix the bug, we should iterate through the input dictionary and construct the command list properly by adding each key-value pair to the list in the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now properly format the command list and pass the failing tests.
