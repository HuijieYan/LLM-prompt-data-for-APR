## Analyzing the buggy function
The function `_dict_arg` takes three parameters: `self`, `name`, and `value`. It checks if the `value` is not empty and is a dictionary using the `isinstance` function. If both conditions are met, it iterates through the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends formatted strings to the `command` list.

## Potential error locations
1. The variable `value` is used as both the input parameter and the loop variable, which can lead to confusion.
2. The use of double quotes around the formatted strings may not be appropriate.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the reassignment of the `value` variable within the loop, leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the use of double quotes may lead to incorrectly formatted command items.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Use a different variable name in the loop to avoid reassignment and confusion.
2. Remove the unnecessary double quotes around the formatted strings.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command.append(name + '={0}={1}'.format(key, val))
    return command
```
