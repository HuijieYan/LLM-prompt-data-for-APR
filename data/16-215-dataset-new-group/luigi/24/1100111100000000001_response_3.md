To address the bug in the `_dict_arg` function, we can see that the function is using the variable name "value" in the for loop, which is the same name as the input parameter. This is causing a conflict and overwriting the original "value" parameter. To fix this, we should use a different variable name for the loop iteration.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use a different variable name for the loop iteration
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, we have changed the variable name from "value" to "val" in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" parameter. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
