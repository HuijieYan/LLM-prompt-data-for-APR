The issue with the `_dict_arg` function seems to be that it is overwriting the `value` variable used in the loop with the value from the dictionary. This is causing incorrect values to be appended to the `command` list.

To fix the bug, we should change the variable name used in the loop from `value` to something else, to avoid overwriting the function parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # change the variable name here
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

By using a different variable name (`prop_value`), we can ensure that the original `value` variable is not overwritten and the correct values are appended to the `command` list.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
