The cause of the errors in the failing test can be found in the `_dict_arg` function. The problem is caused by the bug in the `_dict_arg()` where it is not properly creating the command string for the properties and its values. It incorrectly appends double quotes to the property values when creating the command list.

To fix this bug, the logic of creating the command list from the input dictionary needs to be changed.

Here's a corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # Removed double quotes around property value
    return command
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary double quotes around `val` when constructing the command list. Replacing the double quotes around `val` with a simple string concatenation will fix the issue.

With this change, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and no longer raise the assertions mentioned in the error messages.
