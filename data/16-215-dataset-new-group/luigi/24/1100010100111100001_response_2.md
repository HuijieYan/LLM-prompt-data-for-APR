The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the unnecessary use of quotation marks around the property value when building the command list. This is creating a mismatch with the expected command list, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotation marks from the property value when constructing the command list in the `_dict_arg` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now produce the correct command list without unnecessary quotation marks, and the failing tests should pass.
