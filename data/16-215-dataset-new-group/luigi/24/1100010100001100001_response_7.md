### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is intended to create a command list based on the input dictionary. However, the bug lies in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The problem is with `name` being included as a separate element in the list, and also the unnecessary double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary double quotes and include `name` as part of the format string, instead of being a separate element in the list.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0} {1}={2}'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
