The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is that it's incorrectly wrapping the value of a property in double quotes. This is causing the test failures because the values are not correctly matched. 

The cause of the bug is that the function `_dict_arg` incorrectly wraps the value of a property in double quotes, causing the discrepancy in the list elements when comparing the expected list with the actual list in the test cases.

The fix for the bug is to remove the double quotes from the value when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # changed the variable name here to avoid conflict
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed double quotes from {0}={1}
    return command
```
