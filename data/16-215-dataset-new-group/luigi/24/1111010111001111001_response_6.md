# The buggy function is failing to properly format the command list
The function "_dict_arg" is intended to take a dictionary and convert it into a list of command options, with each key-value pair in the dictionary representing a separate option. However, the function is not formatting the command list correctly, resulting in the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the formatting of the command list, resulting in incorrect formatting and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly format the command list by adding each key-value pair as a separate option in the correct format.

## A corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Renamed the variable to val to avoid confusion
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use val instead of value
    return command
```
