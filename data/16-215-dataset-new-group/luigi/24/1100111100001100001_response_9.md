The bug in the _dict_arg function is that it overwrites the variable 'value' within the for loop, causing incorrect values to be appended to the command list. This is due to the fact that the variable 'value' is being re-used in the for loop, causing a conflict between the input argument and the loop variable.

To fix this bug, we need to rename the loop variable 'value' to something else, such as 'val' to avoid conflict with the input argument 'value'. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the loop variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the renamed loop variable 'val'
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly build the command list without overwriting the input parameter 'value'.
