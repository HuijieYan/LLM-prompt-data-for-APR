This is an issue with the `_dict_arg` function that is supposed to parse the values of a dictionary and return a list. However, the issue is with the way the function constructs the command list, specifically with how it adds the properties and values to the list.

The cause of the bug is that the function adds quotes around the value of the properties, rather than adding the key-value pair as a string. This is evident from the error message which shows a comparison of the expected list and the actual list showing differences in the placement of quotes in the properties and values.

To fix this, the function should construct the command list without adding quotes around the values. Instead, the properties and values should be concatenated as a single string with the correct format.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

In the corrected version, the quotes around the concatenation of properties and values have been removed so that they are now added as a single string. This should resolve the issue and the function should now produce the expected command list.
