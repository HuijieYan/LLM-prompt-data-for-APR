The buggy function `_dict_arg` is designed to take a name and a value, and then create a command list based on the input parameters. It checks if the value is a dictionary and then iterates through its items to construct the command list.

The bug in the function is caused by the reusing of the variable name "value" in the for loop. This overwrites the original "value" input parameter and causes unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to use a different variable name in the for loop to avoid overwriting the original "value" input parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function will correctly construct the command list without overwriting the original "value" input parameter.
