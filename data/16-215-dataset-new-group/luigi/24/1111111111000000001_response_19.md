The buggy function `_dict_arg` is part of the class `SparkSubmitTask` within the file `luigi/contrib/spark.py`. The bug seems to occur when the function tries to process the input dictionary. The function is supposed to construct a command to be used with subprocess.Popen based on the key-value pairs provided in the input dictionary.

The potential error locations within the `_dict_arg` function include:
1. Looping through the dictionary to extract and format the key-value pairs.
2. Appending the formatted key-value pairs to the `command` list.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
1. The function is not handling the keys and values of the input dictionary properly.
2. It is not properly constructing the command based on the key-value pairs.

To fix the bug:
1. Re-implement the loop to properly extract and format the key-value pairs from the input dictionary.
2. Construct the command by concatenating the formatted key-value pairs to ensure the correct format for the command used in subprocess.Popen.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    
    # ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, val in value.items():  # Rename 'prop' to 'key' for clarity
                command += [name, "--{0}={1}".format(key, val)]  # Use the correct format for the command
        return command
```

After implementing these changes, the function should be able to correctly construct the command based on the input dictionary, and pass the failing tests.
