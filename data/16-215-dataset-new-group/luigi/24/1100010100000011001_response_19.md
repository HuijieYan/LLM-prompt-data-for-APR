The bug in the _dict_arg function is that the variable 'value' is being overwritten inside the for loop, causing unexpected behavior. 

To fix the bug, we can simply change the variable name inside the for loop to something different from 'value', to avoid overwriting the original value of 'value'. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for both cases.
