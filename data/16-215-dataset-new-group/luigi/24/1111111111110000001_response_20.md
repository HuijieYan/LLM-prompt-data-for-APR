The buggy function `_dict_arg` contains a bug that is causing the failing tests. At the heart of the issue is the handling of key-value pairs passed as a dictionary. The bug is resulting in differences between the expected and the actual list during assertions.

The primary issue lies in how the arguments are being formed in the `_dict_arg` function when it receives a dictionary. The bug is that the function is incorrectly wrapping the value in additional quotation marks, causing the arguments to be constructed incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we should remove the quotation marks around the `prop=value` pairs in the command construction process in the `_dict_arg` function. This way, the resulting argument list will resemble the expected list during assertions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            # Removed the additional quotation marks around the prop-value pair
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly build the list of arguments, producing the results in a format that is consistent with the expectations of the tests, resolving the test failures.
