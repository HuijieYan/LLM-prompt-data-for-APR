To fix this bug we need to modify the _dict_arg function in the provided spark.py file. The bug leads to the issue with parsing properties when building the command. The function doesn't properly unwrap the value in the command building for the key-value pairs. The string "{0}={1}".format(prop, value) creates a key-value pair where the value portion is always wrapped in double-quotes. The error is reported because of the mismatch in handling of properties in the command being built.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # renaming the value to val to avoid overwriting the original value
            command += [name, '{}={}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the above correction, the test should pass successfully without any errors. This modification ensures that command-building correctly formats the key-value pair commands and eliminates the issue reported in the failing test cases.
