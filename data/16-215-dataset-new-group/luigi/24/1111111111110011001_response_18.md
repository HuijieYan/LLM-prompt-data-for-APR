The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is due to the unnecessary addition of quotes around the property-value pair in the command list. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual list of command arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pair when adding it to the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This version removes the unnecessary quotes around the property-value pair, which should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
