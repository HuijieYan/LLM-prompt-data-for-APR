The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is not provided when initializing the `Worker` object.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to add a NoneType and an int, which causes a TypeError. This occurs because `self.last_active` is initialized to `None` and is not checked before being used in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we should add a check in the `prune` method to verify that `self.last_active` is not None before performing the addition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
    
def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # perform the prune operation
        pass
```

With this correction, the `prune` method checks if `self.last_active` is not None before using it in the addition, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
