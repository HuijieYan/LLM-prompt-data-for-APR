The bug in the given function is that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None` and is not being checked before being used. This could cause issues when creating a new Worker object with a specified `last_active` time.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and initialize it with the current time. We also need to handle the case where `last_active` is provided as an input.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, we are checking if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to the current time if it is, otherwise, we use the provided `last_active` value. This will ensure that the `last_active` attribute of the Worker object is always initialized properly.
