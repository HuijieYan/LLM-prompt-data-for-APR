```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
Explanation:
- The original code initializes the last_active attribute with a default value of None, and then sets it to the current time when the Worker class is instantiated. However, the prune function is expecting last_active to be an integer (seconds since epoch).
- In the corrected code, we check if last_active is None and only set it to the current time if it's None, otherwise, we use the provided last_active value.

This should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
