To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. We will set `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` function will handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time.

The corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test.
