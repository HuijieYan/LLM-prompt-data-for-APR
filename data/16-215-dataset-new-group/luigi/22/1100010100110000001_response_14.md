The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to default to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add a value to it.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` has a default value that can be used in mathematical operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the `last_active` parameter is assigned a default value of 0 using a conditional expression. This ensures that `last_active` is always a valid value for mathematical operations, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
