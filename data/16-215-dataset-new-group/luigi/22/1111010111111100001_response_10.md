The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when attempting to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this, we will assign a default value of 0 to `last_active` if it is not provided when initializing a Worker object.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """


    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Fix default value for last_active
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will default to 0 if not provided, ensuring that there will be no `TypeError` when adding it to an integer in the `prune` method. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
