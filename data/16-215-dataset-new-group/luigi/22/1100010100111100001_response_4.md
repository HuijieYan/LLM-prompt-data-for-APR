The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, and when the `prune` function is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, but `self.last_active` is `None`, which causes the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is checked to see if it is `None`, and if it is, the current time is assigned to it. This ensures that there won't be a `None` value causing a TypeError when the `prune` function is called.
