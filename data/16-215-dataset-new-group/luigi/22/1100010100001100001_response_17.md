## The corrected version of the function

```python

# the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    if last_active is not None:
        self.started = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

### Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` time was being ignored and overwritten with the current time using `time.time()` regardless of whether `last_active` was provided or not. To fix this, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and if not, then set `self.started` to the value of `last_active`. Otherwise, set it to the current time.

The corrected version includes an if-else condition to assign the correct value to `self.started` based on the value of `last_active`.

Now, the function will initialize `self.started` using the provided `last_active` value if one is provided, and otherwise, it will use the current time.
