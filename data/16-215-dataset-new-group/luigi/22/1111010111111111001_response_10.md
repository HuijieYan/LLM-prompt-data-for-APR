The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to default to `None`, and then there is a comparison with `None` and an integer in the `prune` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly in the `prune` method. We can initialize `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if it is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the failing test case. The corrected version of the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
