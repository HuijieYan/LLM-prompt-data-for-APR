The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly.

The `last_active` parameter is passed as an argument to the `__init__` function, but it is not being used to initialize the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should be used to initialize the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is used to initialize the `last_active` attribute, and if it is not provided, the current time is used as the default value.

This should ensure that the `Worker` instance is initialized correctly and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass.
