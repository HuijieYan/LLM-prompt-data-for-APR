The potential error in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default and then assigned to `self.last_active`. However, when the `last_active` parameter is not provided when instantiating the `Worker` object, it will always be set to `None` and the actual time of last activity will not be captured.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to set `self.last_active` to the current time if `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for `last_active` being `None` and if it is, we set `self.last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`. If `last_active` is provided, then its value is used to initialize `self.last_active`.
