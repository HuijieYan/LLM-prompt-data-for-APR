To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if it is None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:  # check if last_active is None
        self.last_active = time.time()  # initialize to current time
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # use the provided value
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be initialized to the current time if it is None, and the function should work as expected.
