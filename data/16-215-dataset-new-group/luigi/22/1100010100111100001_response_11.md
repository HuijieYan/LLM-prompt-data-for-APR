The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case when `last_active` is passed as `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`).

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` defaults to the current time if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should handle the case when `last_active` is provided as `None`, defaulting to the current time. This should fix the `TypeError` that was encountered in the failing test.
