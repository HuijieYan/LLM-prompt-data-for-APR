The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class in luigi/scheduler.py. The function takes two parameters: worker_id and last_active, with last_active having a default value of None. Inside the function, the current time is stored in the 'started' attribute using time.time().

The failing test is test_worker_prune_after_init which creates a Worker object, and then calls the prune method on it, passing an instance of TmpCfg as an argument.

The potential error in the buggy function is that the last_active attribute is initialized to None, and it's not being updated to the current time when the prune method is called. This could cause issues when attempting to prune the worker as the last_active time may not accurately reflect the actual last active time.

To fix the bug, we can update the last_active attribute to the current time whenever the prune method is called. This ensures that the last_active time accurately reflects the last time the worker was active.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the last_active attribute is set to the current time if it's not provided, ensuring that it accurately reflects the last active time of the worker. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
