The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file has an issue with the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It's not correctly initialized with the provided default value of `None`. This could potentially cause issues when the `prune` method is called in the failing test, as it might be expecting a valid `last_active` value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the provided default value if it's not explicitly passed in the constructor. We can achieve this by adding a conditional statement to check if `last_active` is `None` and then assign the default value.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if the `last_active` parameter is not provided. This should ensure that the `prune` method in the failing test works as expected.
