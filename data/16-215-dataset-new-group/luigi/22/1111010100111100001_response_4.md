The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter can be None, and when the `prune` method is called with the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, it tries to add an integer with a None type, which results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is None before comparing it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # the corrected constructor
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # the corrected prune method
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # logic for pruning the worker
            pass
```

With this fix, we check if the `last_active` parameter is not None before comparing it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. If the `last_active` is None, the comparison is not performed, avoiding the TypeError.
