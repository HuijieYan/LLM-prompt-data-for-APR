The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to the `last_active` attribute when it is provided. The `last_active` parameter is being shadowed by the attribute of the same name.

To fix this bug, we need to explicitly check if the `last_active` parameter is None, and only then assign it to the `last_active` attribute. Here's the corrected version:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
