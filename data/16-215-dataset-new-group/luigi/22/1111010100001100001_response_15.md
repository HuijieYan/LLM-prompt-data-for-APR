The bug in the given function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly if it is provided as an argument. As a result, the `last_active` attribute is not being set to the correct value. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided value or `None` if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
