The bug in the function is that the `last_active` parameter is not assigned to the `last_active` attribute properly. The value of `last_active` is being assigned directly to the class attribute, but it should be checked whether it has been provided or not.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is provided. If it is provided, then it should be assigned to the `last_active` attribute; otherwise, it should be initialized as `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function will properly handle the `last_active` parameter and assign it to the class attribute accordingly, avoiding the bug that caused the incorrect behavior.
