The buggy function is failing because it is trying to add a value of type 'NoneType' to an integer, which causes a TypeError.

The buggy function is failing at this line:
```python
if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
```

The error message indicates that the variable `self.last_active` is of type 'NoneType', which means it has not been initialized with a value. This is evident from the input parameters, where `last_active` is passed as `None`. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized with the current time if it is not provided as an argument.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time if no value is provided, preventing it from being of type 'NoneType' and causing the function to work as expected.
