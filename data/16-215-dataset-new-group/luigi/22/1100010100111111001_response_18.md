The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is passed as `None`. As a result, when trying to compare `self.last_active` with a delay value in the `prune` method, a TypeError is raised due to unsupported operand types.

To fix this bug, the function should check whether `last_active` is None and handle it accordingly to avoid the TypeError when comparing it with other numeric values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
By using a conditional assignment, the corrected function ensures that `last_active` is set to the current time if it is None, thereby preventing the TypeError when performing arithmetic operations.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
