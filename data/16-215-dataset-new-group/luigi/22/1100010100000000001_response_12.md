## Corrected version of the function
```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

## Analysis and explanation
The potential error in the original function is the default value assignment for the `last_active` parameter. If the `last_active` parameter is not provided, the function sets it to `None`. However, when setting the `last_active` attribute for the class instance, it should be set to the current time if no value is provided.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can update the assignment of `self.last_active` to check if a value is passed as an argument. If a value is not passed, we can set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

The corrected version of the function includes a condition to check if `last_active` is not `None`. If it's `None`, it sets `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`. Otherwise, it uses the provided `last_active` value.
