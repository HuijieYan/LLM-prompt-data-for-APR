The buggy function has an issue with handling the `last_active` parameter when it is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by assigning a default value to it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the necessary actions
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` when it is used in the `prune` method. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
