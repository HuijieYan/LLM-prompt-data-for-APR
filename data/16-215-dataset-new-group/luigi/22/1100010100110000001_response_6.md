The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message is `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`, which indicates that there is an unsupported operand type in the `prune` method when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is `NoneType`) with an integer.

The potential error location is the `last_active=None` parameter in the `__init__` method. Because `last_active` is set to `None` by default, this can cause issues when performing arithmetic operations with it.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized to `None` by default in the `__init__` method. When the `prune` method attempts to add `self.last_active` with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`), it causes a `TypeError` because adding `None` with an integer is not supported.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `__init__` method to set a default value for `last_active` that is an integer representing the seconds since the epoch. This will ensure that `last_active` is always an integer and prevent the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.

The corrected version of the `__init__` method is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `last_active` to `time.time()` by default, it ensures that `last_active` is always an integer representing the seconds since the epoch. This will prevent the `TypeError` in the `prune` method and fix the bug.
