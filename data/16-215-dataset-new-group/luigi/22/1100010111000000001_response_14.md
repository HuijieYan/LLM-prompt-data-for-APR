The bug in the __init__ function is that it sets the 'last_active' attribute to the value of 'last_active' parameter, which defaults to None instead of setting it to the current time when last active is not provided. 

The failing test 'test_worker_prune_after_init' is failing because it expects the 'last_active' attribute to be set to the current time when the Worker object is initialized.

To fix this bug, we can modify the __init__ function to set the 'last_active' attribute to the current time if it is not provided. Additionally, we need to import the 'time' module in the scheduler.py file.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the failing test 'test_worker_prune_after_init' should pass because the 'last_active' attribute is initialized correctly in the Worker object.
