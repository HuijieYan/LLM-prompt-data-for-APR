The bug in the provided function is that the 'last_active' parameter is set to None by default, and then there is an attempt to perform addition with it and an integer in the 'prune' method. This causes a TypeError when trying to add an integer to 'NoneType'.

To fix the bug, the 'last_active' parameter should default to 0 instead of None. This way, it will always be initialized with a valid integer value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # default to 0 instead of None
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should no longer result in a TypeError and should pass the failing test.
