The issue in the `prune` method is due to the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`. 

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__init__` method to initialize `last_active` with a default value of `0`. This way, if no value is provided, it will default to 0 instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do something here
            pass
```

With this change, the `last_active` variable will default to 0 if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`. This should fix the issue with the failing test.
