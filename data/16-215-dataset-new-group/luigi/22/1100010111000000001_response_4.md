The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class seems to be that it initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None` rather than `time.time()`. This causes issues when the `prune` method is called, as it expects `last_active` to be a timestamp.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to initialize the `last_active` attribute with the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:  # check if last_active is None
        self.last_active = time.time()  # initialize last_active with current time
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # use the provided last_active value
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it holds a valid timestamp when the `prune` method is called.

This corrected version of the `__init__` function should now pass the failing test.
