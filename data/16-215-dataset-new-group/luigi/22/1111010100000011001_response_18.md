## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # This is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id):
        self.id = worker_id
