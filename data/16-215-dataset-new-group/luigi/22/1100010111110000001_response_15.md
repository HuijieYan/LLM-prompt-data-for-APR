## Analysis
The error message indicates a "TypeError" due to an unsupported operand type for the "+" operator, specifically involving a `NoneType` and an `int`. This suggests that the `last_active` attribute of the Worker class is not being properly initialized.

## Identified Potential Error Location
The `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function of the Worker class is initialized as `None`. This is the potential cause of the error.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`, and the code attempts to perform an addition operation involving a `NoneType` and an `int`, triggering a TypeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute of the Worker class needs to be properly initialized to avoid a `NoneType` being used in arithmetic operations.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
