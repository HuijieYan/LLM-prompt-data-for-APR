The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly to the `last_active` attribute of the class. Instead, it is being assigned to the `self.started` attribute. This is evident from the runtime values and types of the variables, where `self.last_active` should be `1706548223.648739` (float) but is actually `1706548223.6552343` (float), indicating that it has been incorrectly assigned the value of `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute within the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
