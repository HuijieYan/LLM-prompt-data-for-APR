The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method. Instead, it's being set to the `self.started` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to set the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
