The bug in the `Worker` class `__init__` function is that it is not properly setting the `last_active` attribute when it is passed as `None`. This is causing the `prune` method in the failing test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to check the `last_active` parameter and set it to the current time if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be correctly set to the current time if it is passed as `None`, and the failing test should pass.
