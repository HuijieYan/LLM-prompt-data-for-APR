The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is caused by the default value of `last_active` being set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `None` and `int` in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by setting it to an appropriate default value. 

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` function will set `last_active` to the current time if it is passed as `None`, fixing the bug and allowing the `prune` method to work correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
