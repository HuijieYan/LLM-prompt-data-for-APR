The potential error in the buggy function is that it is initializing `last_active` with a default value of `None` and the `prune` function seems to rely on this value being set to a specific timestamp. In the failing test case, `prune` function is being called immediately after initializing the worker object, so it's possible that the `last_active` attribute is not being set correctly, leading to a failure in the test.

To fix the bug, we should set the `last_active` attribute to the current timestamp when the worker is initialized, if it's not provided. This will ensure that the `prune` function can rely on a valid `last_active` value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass successfully.
