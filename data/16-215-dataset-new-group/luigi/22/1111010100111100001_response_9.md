The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is causing a `TypeError` due to the `NoneType` value of `last_active`. This triggers the error when trying to add it to the `worker_disconnect_delay` value in the `prune` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which then causes the TypeError when attempting to add it to another value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and handle it appropriately by setting it to the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, when `last_active` is not provided as an argument, it defaults to the current time, preventing the `NoneType` error in the `prune` method.
