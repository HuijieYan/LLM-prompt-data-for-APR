The bug in the `__init__` function is that it doesn't handle the case where `last_active` is not provided, resulting in `None` being assigned to `self.last_active`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` function.

To fix this, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function. We can use the current time as the default value, so that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter can be omitted, and when it's omitted, it defaults to the current time. This should prevent the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` function with a worker object.

After this correction, running the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass.
