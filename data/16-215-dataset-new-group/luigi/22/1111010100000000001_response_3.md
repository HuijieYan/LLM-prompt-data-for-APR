The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class has an issue with the default value of the `last_active` parameter. The bug is that the mutable default argument `None` is being used. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as the default `last_active=None` is shared between all instances of the class, causing them to reference the same object.

To fix this bug, the default value of `last_active` should be replaced with a unique value for each instance of the class. Using `last_active=None` as the default value is causing the unexpected behavior, as it is being shared across all instances of the class.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the expression `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that each instance of the class gets its own `last_active` value, either provided by the caller or the current time. This will prevent the unexpected behavior caused by the shared default value of `last_active=None`.
