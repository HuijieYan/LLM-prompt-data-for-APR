The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class from the `luigi.scheduler` module.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which could cause issues when it is used in calculations without being explicitly assigned.
2. The `time.time()` function is being used without caution, and it could lead to discrepancies in time calculations.

The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None`, which results in a `TypeError` when it is used in a comparison with the `worker_disconnect_delay` from the `config` object.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter needs to be handled carefully to ensure that it always has a valid value before using it in calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
In the corrected version, the value of `last_active` is checked, and if it is `None`, then the current time is used instead. This ensures that the `last_active` parameter always has a valid value for further calculations.
