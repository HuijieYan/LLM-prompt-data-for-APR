The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set properly when it is provided.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function. This means that when a `last_active` value is provided, it is not being stored in the class instance.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:  # Check if last_active parameter is provided
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the `last_active` parameter is provided. If it is provided, then it is assigned to `self.last_active`. If not, then the current time is used as the default value for `self.last_active`.
