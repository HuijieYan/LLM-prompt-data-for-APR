The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `last_active` variable is set as `None` by default in the function arguments, and then it is used in an operation with an integer value in the `prune` method, causing a `TypeError` at runtime. The `last_active` variable is expected to be a floating-point number representing seconds since epoch, so it should not be set to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided when initializing the `Worker` object, it should default to the current time in seconds since epoch. This will ensure that the `last_active` variable always contains a valid value when used in operations with other time-related variables.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` variable will default to the current time if not provided, ensuring it always contains a valid value for comparison in the `prune` method. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue in the failing test.
