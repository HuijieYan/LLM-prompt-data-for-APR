The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class has the potential errors:

1. The default argument `last_active=None` may cause a problem if `last_active` is not provided during object creation.

2. The line `self.started = time.time()` may cause issues if the time is not properly synchronized between the scheduler and the worker.

3. The class `Worker` lacks error handling for invalid inputs.

The bug is caused by the `last_active` default argument being set to `None` and the `time.time()` being used to set the `started` attribute. These may lead to inconsistency and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it's important to handle the default case for `last_active` and to properly handle time synchronization. We can fix this by using `last_active` to initialize `self.last_active` and removing the `time.time()` call for `started`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the default value for `last_active` is set to `0` and the `started` attribute is initialized to `0` as well. This ensures consistency and avoids unexpected behavior due to default values and time synchronization issues.
