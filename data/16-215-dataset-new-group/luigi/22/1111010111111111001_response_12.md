The bug in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to `None` by default, and the code does not handle this case when performing the prune operation. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to compare `None` with an `int`.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value for it. We can use the current time as the default value for `last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` and assigned the current time if it is `None`.
This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring during the failing test.
