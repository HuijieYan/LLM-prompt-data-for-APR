The bug in the current implementation is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the `last_active` attribute. Instead, it is being assigned to the `reference` attribute. This results in the `last_active` attribute always defaulting to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
