The buggy function `__init__` is missing the `self` parameter in its signature, making it unable to access the object's attributes.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Missing `self` parameter in the `__init__` function signature.
2. Using the `time.time()` function directly without importing the `time` module.

The cause of the bug is that the `__init__` function is missing the `self` parameter in its signature, which is necessary to access the object's attributes and methods. Additionally, the `time.time()` function is being used without importing the `time` module.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` function should have the `self` parameter in its signature and the `time` module should be imported before using the `time.time()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

# The corrected version of the function
class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.worker_id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the `__init__` function now includes the `self` parameter in its signature, and the `time` module has been imported at the beginning of the file.
