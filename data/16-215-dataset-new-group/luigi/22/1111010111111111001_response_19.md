The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class occurs because the `last_active` parameter is not properly handled when it is set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and initialize it to `time.time()` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if it's `None`, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
