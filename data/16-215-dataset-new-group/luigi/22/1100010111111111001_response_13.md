The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None`. When attempting to add the `last_active` parameter to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, a TypeError is raised because you cannot add `None` with an integer. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to an appropriate value.

We can fix the bug by setting the `last_active` parameter to the current time if it is not provided when the `Worker` class is initialized.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it is always a valid float. This should resolve the TypeError when using `worker.prune` in the failing test.
