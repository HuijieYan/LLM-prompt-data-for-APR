```python

    # The corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add implementation for pruning mechanism if needed
```
The corrected function `__init__` has been updated to use the `last_active` parameter if it's not None, and if it is None, it defaults to the current time. This addresses the TypeError that was being raised in the failing test by ensuring that the `last_active` variable is always a valid timestamp.
