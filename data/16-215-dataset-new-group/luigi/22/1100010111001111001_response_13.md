To fix the bug in the `__init__` function, we need to remove the assignment to `self.started` and `self.last_active`. These values should be set to `None` and only initialized when the worker becomes active.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = None  # seconds since epoch (initialize to None)
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making these changes, the `__init__` function will now correctly initialize the `started` and `last_active` attributes to `None` and only update them when the worker becomes active.

This should fix the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` as it is related to the initialization of the Worker instance.
