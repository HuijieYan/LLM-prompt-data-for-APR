The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method, and then a comparison is made between `None` and an integer in the `prune` method, leading to a `TypeError`. To fix this, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before using it in the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

And here is the corrected version of the `prune` method:

```python
def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # prune the worker
```

With these changes, the comparison for `last_active` now includes a check for `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
