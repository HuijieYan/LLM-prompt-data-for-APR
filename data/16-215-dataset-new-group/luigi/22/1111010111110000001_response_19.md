The bug is caused by the `last_active` attribute being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` tries to call the `prune` method on a `Worker` instance with `last_active` set to `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute needs to be handled properly in the `__init__` method, so it is set to the current time if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring in the `prune` method.

This corrected version of the `__init__` method should pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
