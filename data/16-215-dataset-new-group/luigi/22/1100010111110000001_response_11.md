The issue in the buggy function is that it sets the default value of the `last_active` parameter to `None`, and then attempts to perform an addition operation with it in the `prune` method. 

The error message indicates that the `last_active` is of type `NoneType` and is incompatible with the addition operation with an integer.

To fix this bug, the default value of `last_active` should be set to zero instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the default value of `last_active` has been set to `0` which is an integer value and can be safely used in arithmetic operations without raising a TypeError.
