## The source code of the corrected function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """



    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The bug in the original function was that it always set the `last_active` attribute to the current time if no value was provided. This was incorrect as it should only set to the current time if no value is provided, otherwise it should use the provided `last_active` value.

I fixed this by using a conditional expression `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()` to ensure that `last_active` is only set to the current time if no value is provided.

This corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values.
