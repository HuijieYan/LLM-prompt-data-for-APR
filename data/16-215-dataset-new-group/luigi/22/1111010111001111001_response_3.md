The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` and `self.started` values are not being set correctly. The `last_active` parameter is being passed as an argument, but it is not being used to set the `self.last_active` attribute. Similarly, the `self.started` attribute is being set to the current time using `time.time()`, but it should actually be set to the value of `last_active` if it is not None.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function so that it correctly sets the `self.last_active` and `self.started` attributes based on the `last_active` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `self.last_active` and `self.started` attributes are set based on the `last_active` parameter. If `last_active` is not provided, then `time.time()` is used to set both attributes.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
