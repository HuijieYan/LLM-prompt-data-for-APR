The issue with the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class is that it's not taking the `last_active` parameter into account when initializing the `Worker` object. As a result, the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly, which causes the failing test.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly assigned when constructing a `Worker` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly handled, and the `Worker` object will be initialized with the correct value for `last_active`, thus passing the failing test.
