## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

### Bug Fix Explanation
The issue with the original function is that it always assigns the current time to `self.started`, regardless of whether a value for `last_active` is provided. The corrected version checks if `last_active` is `None` and assigns `time.time()` in that case. This ensures that `last_active` gets a value only if it is not provided as an input parameter.

By fixing this bug, the `last_active` value will be set to the input `last_active` if it's not None, otherwise, it will default to the current time.

With this correction, the function will behave as expected and set the correct values for `last_active` and `started` based on the input parameters.
