There is a bug in the __init__ method of the Worker class. The bug is that the last_active parameter is not being properly initialized. This causes a failing test when the prune method is called on a Worker object.

The cause of the bug is that the last_active parameter is being set to None in the __init__ method, and it is not being updated when the worker is initialized. This causes the prune method to fail because it expects last_active to be a valid timestamp.

To fix this bug, the last_active parameter should be properly initialized in the __init__ method. We can use the time module to get the current timestamp and use that as the initial value for last_active.

Here's the corrected version of the __init__ method:
```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With this correction, the last_active parameter will be properly initialized with the current timestamp, and the failing test should now pass.
