Based on the analysis, it seems that the `self.started` value is being set incorrectly in the buggy function. The `time.time()` function is called outside of the function and its value is being set as the start time for the worker. This results in different start times for different workers, which is incorrect. This is causing the failing test because the expected start time is not matching the actual start time.

To fix the bug, the `time.time()` function should be called inside the `__init__` function to capture the start time for the worker at the moment of its initialization. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `self.started` value will be set correctly as the start time of the worker, and it should pass the failing test.
