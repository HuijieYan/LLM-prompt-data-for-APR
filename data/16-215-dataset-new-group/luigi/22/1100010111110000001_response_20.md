The issue with the `prune` method is that it is trying to add `self.last_active` (which is an optional parameter and could be `None`) to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. Since `self.last_active` could be `None`, it is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to handle the case where `self.last_active` is `None` before performing the addition.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter is defaulted to 0 if it is `None`, ensuring that it will always be an integer. This will fix the `TypeError` caused by the addition of `None` and an integer in the `prune` method.
