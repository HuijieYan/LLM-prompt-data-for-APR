The buggy function is the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class within the file `luigi/scheduler.py`. The error occurs when the `prune` method is called on an instance of the `Worker` class, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`.

The potential error locations within the `__init__` method are the `last_active` parameter, which can potentially be `None`, and the line where `last_active` is used in the `prune` method.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None`, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add the value of `last_active` to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This results in a `TypeError` because `None` is not a valid type for addition with an integer.

To fix the bug, we should initialize `last_active` with the current time when it is `None` in the `__init__` method. This will ensure that `last_active` always holds a valid time value and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:  # check if last_active is None
            self.last_active = time.time()  # initialize with current time
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time when it is `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when the `prune` method is called.
