The issue in the buggy function is that it assumes the `last_active` parameter can be `None`, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to add it to an integer using the `+` operator.

To fix this, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` and handle the case where it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if it is not provided, avoiding the `NoneType` error when adding it to an integer using the `+` operator.
