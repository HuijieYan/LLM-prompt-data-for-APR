The error in the provided `__init__` function is that `last_active` is set to `None` as a default argument. This is causing an issue when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object, as it expects `self.last_active` to be an integer representing seconds since epoch and not `None`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `__init__` function to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided, and instead set it to the current time in seconds since epoch.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object. This will ensure that the `prune` method can be called without any issues and will fix the failing test.
