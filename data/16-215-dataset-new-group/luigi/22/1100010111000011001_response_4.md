The bug in the `__init__` function lies in the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` parameter. In the failing test, the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object, which utilizes the `__init__` function. The `prune` method expects the `last_active` attribute to be initialized to `None` by default, but it is not set as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute as `None`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute will be properly initialized to `None` if no value is provided, which will ensure that the failing test passes and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
