```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The bug in the existing code is that when the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it defaults to `None`, and then the `time.time()` is called unconditionally. This means that the `last_active` is not set to the current time when it's not provided. This can cause issues when other parts of the code expect `last_active` to always have a valid value.

To fix the bug, we can check if `last_active` is `None` and then set it to `time.time()` in that case. This ensures that `last_active` always has a valid value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
