The issue in the buggy function is occurring because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method. The error message clearly indicates that the `last_active` is of type `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to set a default value for `last_active` that is not `None` and ensure that it represents the seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the conditional expression `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we can ensure that `last_active` is given a default value of `time.time()` if it is `None`, thereby fixing the bug. When `last_active` is not provided as an argument to the constructor, it will default to the current time.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
