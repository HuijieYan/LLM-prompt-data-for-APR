## Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method within the `Worker` class. The error message is a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`, indicating that the `last_active` attribute is of type `NoneType` and is incompatible with the addition operation. The `prune` method is attempting to add `self.last_active` with `config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` which causes the error.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class where the `last_active` attribute is set to `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not being properly initialized in the `__init__` method, leading to it being of type `NoneType`. When the `prune` method is called, it attempts to add `None` with an integer, causing a `TypeError`.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `last_active` attribute is set to the default value correctly in the `__init__` method. This can be achieved by providing a default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method. 

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # do something
            pass
```
