The issue is that the `last_active` parameter is getting a default value of `None`, and this causes a `TypeError` when trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method.

To fix this, we can set `last_active` to the current time when it is not provided in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Perform the necessary action in case of worker being pruned
```

This fix ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time, avoiding the `TypeError` when used in the `prune` method.
