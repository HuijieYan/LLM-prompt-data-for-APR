The issue with the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class is that it is not setting the `last_active` attribute properly when it is not provided as an input. Additionally, the `prune` function is being called but it is not implemented in the provided code, so we should focus on fixing the `__init__` function.

One potential fix for the bug is to check if `last_active` is provided and if not, set it to the current time. 

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the current time if it's not provided during the initialization. This should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
