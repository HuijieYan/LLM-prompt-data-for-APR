The cause of the bug is that the function `__init__` initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called and tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`.

To fix this bug, we need to provide a default value for `self.last_active` in the `prune` method. We can set the default value to 0 if `self.last_active` is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `prune` method should work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
