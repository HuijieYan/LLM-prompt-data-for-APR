The cause of the bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being used in the function. Instead, the `self.last_active` is being set to the current time using `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function to be used in setting `self.last_active` so that it reflects the last active time provided in the parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version of the `__init__` function, it should now pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` without any issues.
