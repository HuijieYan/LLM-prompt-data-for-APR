```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` is calculated, it results in a `TypeError` because you cannot add `None` and an `int` value.

To fix the bug, you can use a conditional assignment to set `self.last_active` to `time.time()` if its value is `None`. This will ensure that it always has a valid value.

The corrected version of the function is shown above.
