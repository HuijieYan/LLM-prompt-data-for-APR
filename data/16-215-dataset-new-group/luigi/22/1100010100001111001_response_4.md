The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned properly. 

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is being assigned directly to the class attribute `last_active`, which is correct. However, on the next line, the `self.started` attribute is being assigned `time.time()` which is not using the `last_active` parameter. This causes a discrepancy between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, we need to assign the value of `last_active` to `self.started` instead of using `time.time()`. This will ensure that both `last_active` and `self.started` have the same initial timestamp value.

Here is the corrected version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
