The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it doesn't correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute.

The `last_active` attribute is set to the value of the parameter `last_active` when it's not None, otherwise it's set to the current time using `time.time()`. However, in the failing test, the `last_active` parameter is not None, so it's not correctly initialized.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute should be set to the value of the parameter `last_active` directly if it's not None, otherwise it should be initialized to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `Worker` class should now correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute and pass the failing test.
