The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it because you can't add an int value to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly before adding it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it's `None`, so it will always be a valid value to add to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
