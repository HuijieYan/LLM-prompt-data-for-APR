The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0  # or any default value you want when last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version initializes `last_active` to `0` if it is `None`, which prevents the `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer.
