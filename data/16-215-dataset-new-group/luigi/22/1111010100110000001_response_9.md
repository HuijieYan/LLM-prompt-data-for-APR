The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` is initially set to `None` and then later on in the `prune` method, it is being attempted to add an integer `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`, which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `last_active` attribute to be an integer representing the seconds since epoch when the Worker is initialized. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform prune operation
            pass
```

By updating the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method, the error should be resolved. Now, when creating a new Worker object, if the `last_active` is not provided, it will default to the current time in seconds since epoch.
