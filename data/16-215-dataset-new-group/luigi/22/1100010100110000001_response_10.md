## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for addition. This occurs when the `last_active` variable is of type `None` and the code tries to add the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

## Potential Error Locations
The `last_active` variable is initialized with a default value of `None`, which may cause the issue. 

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that when the `last_active` variable is `None`, it cannot be directly added to an integer value, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to compare it with the current time.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by providing a default value for the `last_active` variable that is a valid integer representing seconds since epoch.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # default value changed to 0
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the default value of `last_active` is set to 0, ensuring that it is always a valid integer representing seconds since epoch.
