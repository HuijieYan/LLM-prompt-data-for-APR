The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the function definition, but the function does not handle this case when using it in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we should check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it appropriately in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is `None`, avoiding the TypeError when using it in the `prune` method.
