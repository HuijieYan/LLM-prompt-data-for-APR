The bug is caused because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and then the code attempts to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, which causes a TypeError due to the unsupported operand types for `NoneType` and `int`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before adding `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
