The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not correctly initialized. The `last_active` parameter should default to `None` only if it is not provided, but it should be set to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is provided as `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it's provided as `None`, which fixes the bug in the original function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
