The issue is that the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When `prune` method is called with `config` parameter, it tries to add `None` and an `int`. This results in a `TypeError` since `NoneType` and `int` cannot be added together.

To fix this issue, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch when no `last_active` value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning action here
            pass
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the current time when no `last_active` value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
