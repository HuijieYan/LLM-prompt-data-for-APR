The potential error in the buggy function is that it initializes the last_active attribute to None and then uses it in the function without checking its value. This can lead to potential errors when using last_active in the function.

The buggy function is the __init__ constructor of the Worker class. The bug is that it initializes the last_active attribute to None which can cause issues when using this attribute in the class methods. It should have a default value of the current time in seconds since epoch.

To fix this bug, you can modify the __init__ function to set the last_active attribute to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is None:

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we use a conditional expression to set the last_active attribute to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is None. This ensures that the last_active attribute is always set to a valid value, and avoids potential errors when using it in the class methods.
