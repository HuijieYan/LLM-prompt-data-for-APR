The buggy function 'prune' is trying to use 'last_active', which is initialized as None in the '__init__' method. This is causing a TypeError when trying to add it to 'config.worker_disconnect_delay' in the 'prune' method. 

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that 'last_active' is initialized to a proper value in the '__init__' method.

Here's the corrected version of the '__init__' method:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
By checking if 'last_active' is None, and initializing it to the current time if it is, we ensure that the 'last_active' attribute always contains a valid integer value.

This corrected version should fix the bug and allow the 'prune' method to work as intended.
