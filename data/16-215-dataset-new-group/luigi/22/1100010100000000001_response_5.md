The buggy function appears to be an initialization method for a class, as it contains the `self` parameter. The function is intended to initialize attributes for an instance of the class.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `last_active` parameter is assigned a default value of `None`, but its intention is to hold the time in seconds since the epoch.
2. There is no error handling for cases where `last_active` is not provided as an argument when initializing an instance of the class.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute may not be properly initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior when using instances of the class.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided as an argument, and set it to the current time in seconds since the epoch. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is always initialized to a valid value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
