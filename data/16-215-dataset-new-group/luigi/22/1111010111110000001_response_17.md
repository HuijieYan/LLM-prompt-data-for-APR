The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is initializing the `last_active` parameter with a default value of `None`. This default value then leads to a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called, as it tries to add `None` to an integer value (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`). 

To fix this bug, the default value for `last_active` needs to be set to `0` instead of `None`, so that it can be added to an integer value without causing a `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Default value changed to 0
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with a default value of `0` instead of `None`, and the `prune` method can then be called without causing a `TypeError`. This should make the failing test pass.
