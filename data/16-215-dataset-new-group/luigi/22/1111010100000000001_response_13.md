## Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This method is used to initialize a new instance of the `Worker` class with the provided arguments. The potential error locations within the buggy function include the `last_active` parameter being set to a mutable default value (`None`), and the `started` attribute being set to the current time using `time.time()`. 

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` method occurs when the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the `last_active` attribute is not explicitly set when creating a new `Worker` instance. Additionally, the `started` attribute being set to `time.time()` will always contain the time when the `Worker` instance was created, which could lead to inaccurate time tracking.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should use a default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter, and then explicitly set the `last_active` attribute if a value is provided. We should also remove the default assignment for `last_active` and update the `started` attribute when the `Worker` instance is created.

## The corrected version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
