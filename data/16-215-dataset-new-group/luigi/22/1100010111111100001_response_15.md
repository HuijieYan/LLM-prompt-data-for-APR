The issue is with the `last_active` parameter being `None` by default in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this, we can provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method. If no value is provided, we can set it to `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method.
