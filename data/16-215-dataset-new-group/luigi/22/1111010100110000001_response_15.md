The buggy function `__init__` initializes the Worker class with `last_active` set to `None`. This causes the bug when calling the `prune` method and trying to add `None` to an integer value in the condition `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to provide a default value for `last_active` that is not `None`. We can set it to 0 if no value is given. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # rest of the class...
```
