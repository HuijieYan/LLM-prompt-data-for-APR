The issue with the buggy code is that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, which causes a TypeError when it is attempted to be added to an integer in the `prune` function.

To fix this bug, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function, instead of setting it to `None`. We can use the current time as the default value for `last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is always initialized with the current time if no value is provided, which resolves the TypeError issue in the failing test.
