The issue in the provided buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is not provided (i.e., it is `None`). This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

To fix this bug, we should provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # default to current time if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is provided with a default value of `time.time()` if it is not explicitly provided, ensuring that it is always a valid time value. This should fix the `TypeError` issue.
