## Analysis
The `__init__` function is a constructor for a class, which initializes the class attributes with default values. There are a few potential error locations in this function, such as using a mutable default argument `last_active=None`, initializing the `self.started` attribute with the same value for all instances, and not checking if the `last_active` parameter is provided.

## Cause of the Bug
The potential bug in this function is that the `last_active` attribute is set to the default value of `None`, and the `self.started` attribute is initialized with the same value for all instances. Additionally, the function does not check if the `last_active` parameter is provided by the caller.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Avoid using mutable default arguments.
2. Check if the `last_active` parameter is provided and handle it appropriately.
3. Initialize the `self.started` attribute with the current time if it's not provided by the caller.

## The corrected version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `last_active` parameter is provided and initialize the `self.last_active` attribute accordingly. If it's not provided, we initialize it with the current time using `time.time()`. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is set appropriately for each instance.
