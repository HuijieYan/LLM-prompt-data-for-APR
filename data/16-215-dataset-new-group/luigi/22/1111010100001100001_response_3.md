The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly. The `last_active` parameter is supposed to default to `None` if no value is provided. However, it is being set to the value of `last_active` when the function is called.

To fix the bug, we need to explicitly check if `last_active` is `None` and only assign the provided value if it is not `None`. Otherwise, we should default it to `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to `None` if not provided, solving the bug.
