The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is being set to `None` by default, and then the buggy function tries to add an integer value to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value. We can use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the `if` statement to check if `last_active` is not None, we provide a valid default value for it, which prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
