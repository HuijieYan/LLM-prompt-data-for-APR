The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter, which is the seconds since epoch, is not correctly being initialized to the provided value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the provided value.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By using a conditional statement `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that if the `last_active` parameter is provided, it will be used for initialization, otherwise, the current time will be used as the default value.
