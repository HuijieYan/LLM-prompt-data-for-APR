The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is causing a TypeError in the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test in the `scheduler_test.py` file. The error message indicates that the issue is related to unsupported operand types for addition (NoneType and int) at line 245 of `luigi/scheduler.py`.

The root cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is set to a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add the value of `last_active` to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in a TypeError due to the NoneType.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function should be initialized with the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it is always an integer and preventing the TypeError when it is used in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
