The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter can be `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with it.

To fix this bug, we can initialize the `last_active` parameter to the current time if it is provided as `None`. This will ensure that there is always a valid value for `last_active` when performing the addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is defaulted to the current time if it is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring in the failing test.
