# The corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    if last_active is not None:
        self.started = last_active  # set `started` as `last_active` if it is not None
    else:
        self.started = time.time()  # set `started` as the current time if `last_active` is None
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

### Explanation
The bug in the original function stems from incorrectly setting the `self.started` variable. The function sets `self.started` to the current time regardless of the value of `last_active`. This results in a discrepancy between the value of `last_active` and `started`.

To fix this bug, the corrected function includes a conditional statement to check if `last_active` is not None. If it is not None, then `self.started` is set to the value of `last_active`. Otherwise, `self.started` is set to the current time using `time.time()`.

This ensures that the `self.started` variable corresponds with the value of `last_active` when it is provided and accurately reflects the time of the worker's activity.
