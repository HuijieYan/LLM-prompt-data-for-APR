The buggy function is `__init__` in the `Worker` class within `luigi/scheduler.py`. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is trying to call the `prune` method on a `Worker` instance, which is triggering the error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`.

The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and when the `prune` method tries to add `worker_disconnect_delay` to it, it results in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` within the `prune` method. We can add a check to see if `last_active` is `None`, and if so, set it to the current time when the `prune` method is called.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

```

With this correction, the `__init__` method will default `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, preventing the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
