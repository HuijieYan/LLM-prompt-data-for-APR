The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, but later it is used in the `prune` method without being checked for `None` value.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check in the `prune` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. We can do this by adding an `if` statement to check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison with `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform the deletion here
            pass
```

By adding the check `if self.last_active is not None` in the `prune` method, we ensure that the comparison with `time.time()` is only performed when `last_active` has a valid value, fixing the TypeError that was occurring when `last_active` was `None`.
