The buggy function seems to be the constructor for a class related to task scheduling, with the intention to initialize certain properties of the worker object.

The potential error in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is directly assigned to the `self.last_active` property, which might cause unexpected behavior if the `last_active` parameter is modified after initialization.

The bug is likely caused by not properly handling the `last_active` parameter and assuming it will not change after initialization.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be directly assigned to the `self.last_active` property inside the constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In this correction, the `last_active` parameter is checked for a value, and if it is `None`, then the current time is used instead. This ensures that the `last_active` property always holds the correct value regardless of the input parameter.
