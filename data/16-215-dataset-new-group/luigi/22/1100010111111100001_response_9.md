To fix the bug in the `__init__` function, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None` if no value is provided. The issue arises because the code is trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` when `self.last_active` is `None`, leading to a TypeError.

In this case, we will modify the `__init__` function to handle the default value of `last_active` correctly. We should modify the function implementation to:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if no `last_active` value is provided during the initialization of the Worker object, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`. This will prevent the TypeError when calculating `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

The corrected version of the `__init__` function will ensure that the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` will pass successfully.

Let me know if you need additional support.
