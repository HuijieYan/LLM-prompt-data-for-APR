## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class within the `luigi.scheduler` module. It initializes various attributes of the Worker instance, including `last_active` and `started` attributes based on the current time. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a `Worker` instance and then calls the `prune` method with a `TmpCfg` object.

## Identifying potential error locations:
The potential error could be caused by the initialization of `last_active` and `started` attributes in the `__init__` method, as well as in the `prune` method called in the failing test.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the original function is that the `last_active` and `started` attributes are set to the current time using `time.time()` during the initialization of the `Worker` instance. This means that when the `prune` method is called in the test, it will check the difference between the current time and the time the worker was initialized, and prune the worker if the difference exceeds the `worker_disconnect_delay` value.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `last_active` and `started` attributes are initialized. Instead of setting them to the current time in the `__init__` method, we should initialize `last_active` to `None` and calculate the `started` time only when needed, such as when the worker is actually started or activated.

## The corrected version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = None  # initialized to None
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def start(self):
        self.started = time.time()  # calculate the started time when the worker is started

    def prune(self, tmp_cfg):
        if self.last_active is not None and (time.time() - self.last_active) > tmp_cfg.worker_disconnect_delay:
            # prune the worker if the last active time exceeds the disconnect delay
            pass
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` is initialized to `None` and the `started` time is set when the `start` method is called. This ensures that the worker's activation time is properly recorded, and the `prune` method can work as expected in the test.
