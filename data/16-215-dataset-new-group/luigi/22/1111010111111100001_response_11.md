The issue with the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class is that it initializes the `last_active` parameter with a default value of `None`, and then immediately tries to use it in the calculation. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly by setting a default value. A common approach is to use the current time as the default value for `last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # Fixed __init__ function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is `None` and then setting a default value using the current time if needed, we ensure that the function will not raise a `TypeError` when trying to calculate based on `last_active`. This should fix the issue and allow the test to pass.
