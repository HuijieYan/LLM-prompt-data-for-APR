The issue with the `__init__` function in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is that it accepts an optional parameter `last_active` which defaults to `None`. However, later in the code, the `prune` method tries to add `self.last_active` (which is potentially `None`) with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in the `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added with an integer.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by setting it to 0, or a default value, ensuring it's always an integer when used in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is set to 0 when `None` is passed, ensuring that it's always an integer and prevents the `TypeError`.

Now the `prune` method should work correctly when tested.
