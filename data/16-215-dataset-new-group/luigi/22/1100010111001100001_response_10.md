The bug in the __init__ function is that the last_active parameter is not being set correctly when it is provided as an argument. It should be set to the value of the last_active parameter if it is not None, otherwise, it should default to the current time.

To fix the bug, we need to update the __init__ function to correctly handle the last_active parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the last_active parameter will be correctly set to the provided value if it is not None, and default to the current time if it is None. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
