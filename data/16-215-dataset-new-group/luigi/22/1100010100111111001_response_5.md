The bug in the `__init__` function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called and tries to add `None` to an integer. 

To fix the bug, we need to assign a default value to `last_active` if it is `None`, and use that value in the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version assigns the current time using `time.time()` to `last_active` if it is `None`, and uses the given `last_active` value if it is not `None`.
