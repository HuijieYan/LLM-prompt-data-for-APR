The bug in the `__init__` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` by setting it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case when `last_active` is `None`, and the test case should pass with the correct expected values.
