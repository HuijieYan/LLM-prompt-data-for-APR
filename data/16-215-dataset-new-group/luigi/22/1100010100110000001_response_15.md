The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as None, and when the `prune` method is called, it attempts to add an integer value to `None`, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be initialized with a default value of `0` instead of `None` to avoid the TypeError when it's being used in arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
