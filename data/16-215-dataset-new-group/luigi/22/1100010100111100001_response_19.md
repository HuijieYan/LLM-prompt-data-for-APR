The issue in the provided code is that the variable `last_active` is initialized as `None`, but a comparison is made against it in the `prune` method, leading to a `TypeError` when adding `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it. The comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` fails because `self.last_active` is `None`.

To fix this bug, the initial value of `last_active` should be set to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding a condition to check if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to the current time if it is, we ensure that `last_active` always contains a valid timestamp.

This correction will enable the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` to work properly without raising a `TypeError`.
