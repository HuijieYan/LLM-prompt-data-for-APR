The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `scheduler.py` file. The function is supposed to initialize the `Worker` object with the given `worker_id` and set certain attributes. 

The potential error location within the buggy function is the initialization of the `self.started` attribute using `time.time()`. This initialization does not take into account the `last_active` parameter, which could lead to the `last_active` parameter being ignored.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being used to initialize the `self.started` attribute, leading to the `started` time being set as the current time regardless of the value of `last_active`.

To fix the bug, we should use the `last_active` parameter to initialize the `self.started` attribute. If `last_active` is provided, it should be used as the `started` time; otherwise, the current time should be used.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.started = last_active
    else:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
