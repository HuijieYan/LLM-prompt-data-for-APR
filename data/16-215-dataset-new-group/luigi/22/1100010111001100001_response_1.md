The bug in the buggy function is that it is not correctly initializing the `last_active` attribute. It is receiving a value for `last_active` as an input parameter, but this value is not being assigned to the `last_active` attribute within the `__init__` function. Instead, it is using the default value of `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute with the value provided as an input parameter. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the `last_active` attribute assignment to check if the input parameter `last_active` is not None, we ensure that it receives the correct value. This will fix the bug and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
