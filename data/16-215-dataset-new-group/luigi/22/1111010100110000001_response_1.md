The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the prune action
            pass    
```

With this correction, the `prune` method first checks if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition operation, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. Now the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
