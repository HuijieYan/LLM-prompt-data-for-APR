The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is causing a `TypeError` when trying to access `self.last_active` in the `prune` method. The `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, and this causes an issue when adding `config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by setting an initial value, which can be the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    # updated __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # set the initial value to the current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, and the `TypeError` will be resolved when running the failing test.
