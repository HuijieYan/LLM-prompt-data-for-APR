## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the original buggy version, the initialization of the `self.started` variable always uses `time.time()`, regardless of whether a `last_active` parameter is provided. This results in the incorrect value being assigned to `self.started` in the case where a `last_active` parameter is provided.

To fix the bug, the corrected version checks if a `last_active` parameter is provided. If it is, then `self.started` should be assigned the value of `last_active`, otherwise it should be assigned the current time using `time.time()`.

The corrected version of the function ensures that `self.started` is initialized correctly based on the input parameters, satisfying the expected input/output values.
