The bug in the given code is that the last_active parameter is being initialized as None, and when the prune function is called, it tries to add None with an integer which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize last_active as an integer equivalent to the current time in seconds since epoch. This will ensure that last_active is a valid value for the comparison in the prune function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected function would ensure that last_active is initialized with a valid time value when None is passed as the last_active parameter. This would fix the TypeError issue encountered during the failing test.
