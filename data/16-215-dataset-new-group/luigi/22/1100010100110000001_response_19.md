The buggy function is the `__init__` method in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message is telling us that there is a `TypeError` in the `prune` method when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is of type `NoneType`) with an integer. This shows that the `last_active` value is not being properly initialized and is defaulting to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is properly initialized to a default value when it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, `last_active` is initialized to the current time using `time.time()` if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid numeric value. This should fix the bug and make the `prune` method work correctly.
