The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the `last_active` attribute if it is provided.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to include a conditional assignment for the `last_active` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:  # added conditional assignment
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to the `last_active` attribute if it is provided, otherwise it will remain as `None`.
