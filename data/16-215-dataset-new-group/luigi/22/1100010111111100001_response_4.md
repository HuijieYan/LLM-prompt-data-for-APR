The issue in the buggy function is with the initialization of the `last_active` parameter. It is set to `None`, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add a `None` value with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) which causes the `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we can implement a check in the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided during initialization of the `Worker` object.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # if last_active is not provided, set it to the current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be set to the current time if it is not provided during initialization, and the `prune` method will not throw a `TypeError`.
