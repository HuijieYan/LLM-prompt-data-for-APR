The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to the default value of `None` correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `last_active` parameter is not `None`, and if it is, we set `self.last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`.

This change will ensure that the `last_active` parameter is initialized correctly, and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` will pass with the expected values and types mentioned for the buggy function.
