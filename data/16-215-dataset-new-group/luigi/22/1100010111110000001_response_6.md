The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the `scheduler.py` file is that it initializes the `last_active` attribute as `None`, causing an error when it is used in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute should be assigned the current time as the default value when it is not provided during initialization. This will ensure that it is always an integer value representing seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will always be an integer value, and the failing test should pass without any errors.
