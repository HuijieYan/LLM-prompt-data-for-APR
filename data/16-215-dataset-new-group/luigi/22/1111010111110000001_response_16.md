The issue with the buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is that it has a default parameter `last_active=None`, but the code does not handle the case where `last_active` is not provided. This leads to `self.last_active` being set to `None`, which causes the TypeError in the failing test when trying to add `None` to an integer.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided. You can set `self.last_active` to the current time if `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the fixed __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` will be set to the current time if it is not provided, and the TypeError in the failing test should be resolved.
