The bug in the provided code is in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The `prune` method called in the failing test expects the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance to be set to a certain value, but this is not happening in the buggy `__init__` function.

The bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not being initialized properly in the `__init__` function, and it should be set to the current time (`time.time()`), as it represents the time when the worker was last active.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized to the current time in the `__init__` function.

The corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always set to a valid value. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
