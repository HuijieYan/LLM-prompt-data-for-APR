## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when the function `prune` tries to perform the operation `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This is due to the fact that `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, and it is being added to an integer value.

## Bug Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are the initialization of `last_active` with a default value of `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by `last_active` being initialized as `None`, which causes the TypeError when trying to perform addition with an integer value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy to fix the bug is to initialize `self.last_active` with the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not given as an argument.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
