## Analysis
The buggy function is `prune` and the failing test is `test_worker_prune_after_init`. The error message indicates that the code is trying to perform an addition operation using `NoneType` and an `int`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `last_active` variable is initialized with a default value of `None`.
2. The `prune` function is trying to use the value of `last_active` without checking if it's `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `last_active` variable being set to `None` by default, and then the `prune` function is trying to add the `None` value with an integer, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` variable is `None` before performing any operations with it. If it's `None`, we should handle it appropriately.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform the pruning operation
            pass
        else:
            # handle the case where last_active is None
            pass
```
