The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it incorrectly initializes the `last_active` attribute. This causes the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` to fail because the `prune` method is expecting `last_active` to be initialized properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to initialize the `last_active` attribute correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized properly when creating a new `Worker` instance, and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass.
