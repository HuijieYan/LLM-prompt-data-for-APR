The issue with the current function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly inside the function. It is being set as a class variable instead of being assigned to the instance variable `self.last_active`.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the `self.` prefix from the `last_active` parameter in the function definition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
