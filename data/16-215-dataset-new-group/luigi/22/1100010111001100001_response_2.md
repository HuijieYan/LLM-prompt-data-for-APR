The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is being incorrectly assigned to `self.last_active`. This can be fixed by adding a check to see if `last_active` is None, and if so, initialize `self.last_active` to the current time.

Additionally, the test function `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates an instance of the `Worker` class from `luigi.scheduler`, but the `prune` method is being called on the worker without any tasks being added to the worker. This could be an issue if the `prune` method expects the worker to have tasks assigned to it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

And the corrected test function:
```python
def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
    worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

    class TmpCfg:
        def __init__(self):
            self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

    task = SomeTask()  # create a task to assign to the worker
    worker.add_task(task)
    worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```
