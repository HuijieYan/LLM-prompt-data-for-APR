In the given buggy function, the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is assigning the `last_active` as `None` by default. Later in the `prune` method, it's trying to add an integer value to the `last_active` attribute, but since it's `None`, it's causing a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it appropriately when adding the delay value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the pruning operation
            pass
```

In the corrected version, a check has been added to the `__init__` method to set the default value of `last_active` to current time if it's `None`. Additionally, in the `prune` method, there's a check to ensure that `last_active` is not `None` before performing any operations on it.
