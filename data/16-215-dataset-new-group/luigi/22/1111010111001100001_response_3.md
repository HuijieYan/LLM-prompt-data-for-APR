The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it does not update the `last_active` attribute correctly when the `last_active` parameter is provided. Instead, it should be set to the provided value if it exists, or to the current time if no value is provided.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to properly handle the `last_active` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the provided value if it exists, or to the current time if no value is provided. This should ensure that the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes.
