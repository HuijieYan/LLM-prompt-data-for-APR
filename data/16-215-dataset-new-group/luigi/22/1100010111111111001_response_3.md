The bug in the buggy function is caused by the `last_active` parameter having a default value of `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and an integer in the `prune` method, as observed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to check if `last_active` is not provided, and if so, set it to the current time. This will ensure that `last_active` always has a valid value.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if not provided, preventing the `TypeError` observed in the failing test.
