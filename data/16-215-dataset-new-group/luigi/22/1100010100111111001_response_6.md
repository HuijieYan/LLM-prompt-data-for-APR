The issue in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is allowed to be `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when it is used in an arithmetic operation.

To fix this bug, we can set a default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter, and then check if it is `None` before using it in the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/scheduler.py

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This fix ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time using `time.time()`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `last_active` is `None`.

With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
