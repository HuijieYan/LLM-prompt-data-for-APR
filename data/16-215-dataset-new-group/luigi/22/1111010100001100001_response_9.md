The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to the default value of `None`, but the `last_active` parameter is not being used to initialize the `last_active` attribute. Instead, the `last_active` attribute is always being set to the current time using `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to use the `last_active` parameter when initializing the `last_active` attribute. If the `last_active` parameter is not provided, then we can default it to `None` as intended.

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fixed version, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the provided `last_active` value, or the current time if no `last_active` value is provided.
