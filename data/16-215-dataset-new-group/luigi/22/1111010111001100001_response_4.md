The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it is not setting the `last_active` attribute correctly when a value is provided. Instead, it is always defaulting to `None`. This causes a problem in the `prune` method when it tries to access `last_active` and `started` without checking if they are `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to properly set the `last_active` attribute when a value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the provided value if it exists, otherwise it will default to the current time. This will ensure that the `prune` method can access the `last_active` attribute without any issues.
