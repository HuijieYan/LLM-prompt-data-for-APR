The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and then the code attempts to perform addition on a `None` type and an `int` type, which causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we should set a default value for `last_active` that is an integer representing the seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the default value for `last_active` is set to the current time since epoch when it is `None`, and the addition operation in the `prune` method should work correctly.
