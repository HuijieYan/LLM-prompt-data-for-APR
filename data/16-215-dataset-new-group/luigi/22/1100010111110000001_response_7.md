The issue here is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, the default value for `last_active` should be set to a valid timestamp instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to perform addition in the `prune` method.
