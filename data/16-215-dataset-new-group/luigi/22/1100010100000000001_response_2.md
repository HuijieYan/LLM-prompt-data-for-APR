## Analyzing the buggy function
The `__init__` function is a constructor for a class, and it initializes instance variables for the class. The bug seems to be with the default value for the `last_active` parameter.

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is defaulting to `None`, which could cause issues when comparing its value with `time.time()`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by using `None` as the default value for the `last_active` parameter. This can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing `last_active` with `time.time()`.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by setting a default value for `last_active` that represents a time in the past, such as 0.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
