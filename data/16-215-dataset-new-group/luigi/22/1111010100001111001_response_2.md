The bug in the function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to `self.last_active` properly. It should be assigned only if the `last_active` parameter is not None.

To fix the bug, we need to check whether `last_active` is None or not, and then assign it to `self.last_active` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if the `last_active` parameter is provided, it will be assigned to `self.last_active`, otherwise, it will remain as None. This satisfies the expected input/output values.
