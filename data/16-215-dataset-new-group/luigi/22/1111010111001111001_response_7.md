Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test, the issue lies in the calculation of the `self.started` attribute. The current implementation sets `self.started` to the result of `time.time()` at the time of object creation, but the failing test expects a specific value for `self.started`, which is different from the current implementation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the initialization of the `self.started` attribute. Instead of using `time.time()` directly, we should use the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, and only use `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.started = last_active
        else:
            self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected implementation, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass, and the expected values and types of variables will match the actual values during the test execution.
