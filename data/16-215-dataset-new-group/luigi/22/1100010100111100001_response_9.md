The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized properly. It is defaulting to `None` when no value is provided, which is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.

To fix this, we need to modify the `__init__` function to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By using a conditional assignment, we set `last_active` to the current time if it was not provided, ensuring that it is always initialized with a valid value.

This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
