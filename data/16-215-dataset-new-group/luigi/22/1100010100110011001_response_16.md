```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # do something
```
With the corrected version of the function, the issue is fixed by checking if `last_active` is not `None` before using it in the arithmetic operation. If it is `None`, it is replaced with `0`. This ensures that the addition operation can be performed correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
