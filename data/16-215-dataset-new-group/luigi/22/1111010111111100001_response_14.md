The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` as a default value for the `__init__` method. This results in a `NoneType` error when it is used in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and assign a default value if it is. In this case, we can use the current time as the default value.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if it is `None`, preventing the `NoneType` error in the `prune` method.
