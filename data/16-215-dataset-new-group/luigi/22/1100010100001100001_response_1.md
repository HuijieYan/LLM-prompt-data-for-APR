The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the `last_active` instance variable. Instead, it is being ignored. The `last_active` instance variable is being set to `None` regardless of the input value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` instance variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` instance variable will be assigned the value of the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, otherwise it will default to the current time using `time.time()`.
