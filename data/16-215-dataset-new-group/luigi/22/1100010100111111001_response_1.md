The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`. To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # prune the worker
        pass  # Replace this with the code to prune the worker
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and avoid the TypeError.
