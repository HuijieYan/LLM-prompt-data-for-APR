The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None`, and when `prune` is called on a worker, it attempts to add `None` to an integer using the `+` operator, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class should be initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch, ensuring that it is an integer and preventing the TypeError when `prune` is called.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else int(time.time())  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            pass  # Placeholder for the pruning logic
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch when it is not explicitly provided, preventing the `TypeError` when calling `prune`.
