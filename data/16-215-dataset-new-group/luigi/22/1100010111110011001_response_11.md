To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is `None`. We can do this by setting a default value for `last_active` in the function signature and providing a check for `None` before adding it to `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
