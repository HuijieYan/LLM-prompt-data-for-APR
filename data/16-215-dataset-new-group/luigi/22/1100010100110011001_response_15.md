```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass
```
The issue in the original code is that when `last_active` is set to `None`, it causes a TypeError when attempting to add it to an integer. To fix this, we can use a conditional to set `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is `None`.

The corrected function will satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
