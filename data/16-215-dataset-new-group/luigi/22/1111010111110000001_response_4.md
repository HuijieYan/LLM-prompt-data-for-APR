The bug occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py`. The error message states that there is a `TypeError` on line 245, specifically with the `+` operator, due to unsupported operand types for `NoneType` and `int`.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None`, and when trying to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method, it causes a `TypeError` because you cannot add `None` and an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided when the `Worker` instance is initialized.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # Set the current time as the default
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute in the `Worker` class will default to the current time if it is not provided during the initialization. This will ensure that `last_active` is always an integer and can be safely added to another integer in the `prune` method.
