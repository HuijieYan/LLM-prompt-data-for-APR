## Potential error locations
1. The `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which might cause issues when calculating the time difference.
2. The `last_active` and `started` attributes are initialized using the `time.time()` function, but it's not clear how they are intended to be used.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` function is that it doesn't properly handle the default value for the `last_active` parameter, and there is potential for confusion in using the `time.time()` function to initialize the `last_active` and `started` attributes.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should:
1. Remove the default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter to avoid any confusion in time calculations.
2. Only grab the current time using `time.time()` for the `started` attribute since it represents the time when the worker is created.

## Corrected Version
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
