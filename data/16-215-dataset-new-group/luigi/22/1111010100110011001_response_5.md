The issue is occurring because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is set to `None` by default, and this is causing a `TypeError` when it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

We can fix this issue by setting a default value for `last_active` that is more suitable for the comparison being made in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected version of the class with the fix:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune logic
```

By using the `if last_active is not None` check in the `__init__` method, we ensure that `last_active` is set to the current time if it was passed as `None`. This fixes the issue with the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
