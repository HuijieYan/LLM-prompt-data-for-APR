The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is initialized as `None`, and when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` instance, it tries to perform an addition operation between `None` and an integer value from the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, causing a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function should be initialized with a default value greater than the current time in seconds since epoch. This ensures that it's always an integer value and can be safely used in the addition operation in the `prune` method.

By defaulting `last_active` to `time.time()` in the `__init__` function, it ensures that it's always set to a valid integer representing seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be initialized with the current time in seconds since epoch if it's not provided, ensuring that it's always an integer value and can be safely used in the `prune` method. This should make the failing test pass.
