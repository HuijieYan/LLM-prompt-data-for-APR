```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In the fix, I added a condition to check if the `last_active` parameter is not None, then use its value. Otherwise, I set the `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`. This will ensure that the `last_active` parameter is never None, and the `started` parameter will always be set to the current time. This should address the issue in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
