The buggy function seems to have a problem with the `last_active` and `started` variables. The `last_active` parameter is being set as `None` by default, but it should be set as the value provided if it's not None. 

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly initialized when it's provided as an argument.

To fix the bug, we should update the `last_active` variable to use the value provided if it's not None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
