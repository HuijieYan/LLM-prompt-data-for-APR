The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py` is that the `last_active` parameter can be None, and the code does not handle that case properly when it tries to add it to a time.

The `test_worker_prune_after_init` test is failing with a TypeError, specifically because the `last_active` is `None` and the code tries to add it to a time.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and avoid adding it to `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By using the conditional statement `last_active if last_active is not None else 0`,  we set `last_active` to `0` if it is `None`. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring.

After making this change, the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test should pass without any errors.
