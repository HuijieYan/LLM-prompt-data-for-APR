The buggy function is the `__init__` method in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.

The error message indicates that the program is trying to perform addition between a `NoneType` and an `int`, which is causing a `TypeError`.

The `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, and the error occurs when the function attempts to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. Since `last_active` can be `None`, it causes the `TypeError` when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

To fix this bug, we should initialize `self.last_active` to `time.time()` only if it is not provided. Otherwise, we should just assign the provided value to `self.last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is given a default value of `None`, and if it remains as `None`, it is initialized with the current time using `time.time()`. Otherwise, the provided value is used. This ensures that `last_active` is always initialized and does not cause the `TypeError` when used in calculations.
