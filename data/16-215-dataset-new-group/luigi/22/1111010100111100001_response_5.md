The bug in the provided code is in the `prune` method that is not shown in the provided code. It seems that the `prune` method is checking if `self.last_active` is `None` and trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it, which is causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform the addition operation with a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing any arithmetic operations with it. We can do this by adding a condition to check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before attempting the addition.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning operations here
            pass
```

With this fix, the condition `if self.last_active is not None` ensures that we only perform the addition operation if `self.last_active` is not `None`, thereby avoiding the `TypeError`.
