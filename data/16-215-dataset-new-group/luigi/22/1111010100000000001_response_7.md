    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

## Analysis and Explanation
The buggy function `__init__` takes a parameter `last_active`, but it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. It directly assigns `time.time()` to `self.last_active` without checking if `last_active` is provided or not. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the `last_active` argument is not provided by the caller.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is `None` and assign `time.time()` to `self.last_active` only if `last_active` is not provided. We can use an `if-else` condition to handle this scenario and ensure that `self.last_active` is initialized correctly.

The corrected version of the function includes this modification, ensuring that the `last_active` parameter is properly handled.
