The bug in the __init__ function of the Worker class in luigi/scheduler.py is that it doesn't handle the case when last_active is None. This results in a TypeError when trying to add last_active and the worker_disconnect_delay.

To fix this bug, we should provide a default value for last_active and check for None before performing the addition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = time.time()  # set to current time if last_active is not provided
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case when last_active is None and set it to the current time before continuing. This should resolve the TypeError when adding last_active and the worker_disconnect_delay.

The corrected version ensures that the last_active value defaults to the current time if not provided, allowing for the addition to work as intended, and aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
