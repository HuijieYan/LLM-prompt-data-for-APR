## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

## Analysis and Explanation

The potential error in the original function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to `time.time()` unconditionally, regardless of whether a value is passed in for `last_active`. This means that the `last_active` parameter is not being used as intended and the provided `last_active` value is being ignored.

The corrected version of the function uses a conditional statement to check if a value is provided for `last_active`. If a value is provided, it uses the provided value; otherwise, it sets `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`.

By making this change, the function will correctly use the `last_active` value provided, if any, or default to the current time if no value is provided.
