## Revised and Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

### Explanation:

The cause of the bug in the original `__init__` function is that it was not handling the case where `last_active` is `None` when initializing `self.last_active`. This caused the failing test since the `prune` method was making use of `last_active` and assuming it would have a default value.

### Fix Strategy:

Modify the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is `None`, and if so, set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

### Result:

After making the above correction, the corrected `__init__` function should work properly and initialize `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, which will in turn pass the failing test.
