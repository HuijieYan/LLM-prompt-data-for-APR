The buggy function has an issue with the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. This causes an error when it is used in the `prune` method because `None` cannot be added to an integer (time.time()). The cause of the bug is that the default value for `last_active` is `None`, and the `prune` method is attempting to add `None` to an integer.

To fix this bug, the default value for `last_active` needs to be set to `0` instead of `None`. This way, the calculation in the `prune` method will work correctly by using `0` as the starting point for last activity when the worker is first initialized.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter now defaults to `0`, ensuring that it's always set to an integer value and allowing the `prune` method to work without encountering a `NoneType` error.
