The bug in the `__init__` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an `int` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, you can check if `last_active` is `None` and, if so, initialize it to the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This fix initializes `last_active` to the current time if it is `None`, ensuring that it will always have a valid value.
