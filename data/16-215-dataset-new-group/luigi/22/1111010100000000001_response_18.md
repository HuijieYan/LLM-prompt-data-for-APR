The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the `last_active` parameter and the `started` assignment.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is assigned a default value of `None`, and the `started` attribute is assigned the current time using `time.time()`. This means that if `last_active` is not provided as an argument, it will remain `None` and the `started` attribute will always be set to the current time, creating an inconsistency.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if it's not provided as an argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided, it will default to the current time, ensuring consistency with the `started` attribute.
