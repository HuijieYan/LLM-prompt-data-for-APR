The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class lies in the fact that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to `self.last_active`. Instead, it's just being set as a default parameter value and then overridden by the `time.time()` value. This leads to `self.last_active` always being set to the current time.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should be properly assigned to `self.last_active` as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By checking whether `last_active` is provided and only setting `self.last_active` if it is, we ensure that the provided `last_active` value is used and not overridden by the current time.

With this correction, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass as expected.
