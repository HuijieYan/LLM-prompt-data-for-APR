The buggy function `__init__` within the `Worker` class is trying to assign default values to the `last_active` attribute. The error occurs when attempting to prune the workers based on their last active time. The error message indicates that there's a `TypeError` because it's trying to add the value of `last_active` (which is `None`) to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `last_active` attribute is `None` and provide a default value. One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if it's `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
By using `self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that if `last_active` is `None`, then the current time will be used as the default value instead. This should fix the `TypeError` issue when calling the `prune` method.
