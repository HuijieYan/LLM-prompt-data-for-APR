The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to the provided value when it is not None. Instead, it is being set to the current time.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` function to ensure that it is set to the provided value if it is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """


    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding the conditional statement to check whether `last_active` is not None, we ensure that it is only set to the current time when it is not provided. This should fix the bug and correctly initialize the `last_active` parameter.
