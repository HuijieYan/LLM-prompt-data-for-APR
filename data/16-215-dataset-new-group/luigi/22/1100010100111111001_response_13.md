The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` as a default value, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we should set a default value for `last_active` that is not `None` and use that value in the comparison in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Set a default value for last_active
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By setting a default value of `0` for `last_active`, we ensure that it is always a valid integer value, avoiding the `TypeError` when comparing it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.
