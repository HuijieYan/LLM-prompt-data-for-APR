The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is attempting to create a `Worker` object and then call the `prune()` method on it, passing in a `TmpCfg` object. This results in a `TypeError` because the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` is initialized to `None`, and the test is trying to add an integer to `None`.

The cause of the bug is the uninitialized `last_active` attribute, which is set to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This leads to a `TypeError` when the `prune()` method is called.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized to `time.time()` when it is not explicitly provided. This will ensure that it is always a valid timestamp, avoiding the `TypeError` when adding the `worker_disconnect_delay`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to `time.time()` when it is not explicitly provided, preventing the `TypeError` when using it in the `prune()` method.
