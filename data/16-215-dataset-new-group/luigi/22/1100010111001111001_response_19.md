The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is being incorrectly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute in the `__init__` function.

The correct assignment should be `last_active` if it's not None, otherwise calculate the difference between the current time and the start time. Additionally, the `self.started` attribute should be assigned the start time when the Worker instance is created.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be assigned to `self.last_active` only if it's not None. If it's None, then the difference between the current time and the start time will be assigned. The `self.started` attribute is assigned the start time when the Worker instance is created.

This corrected code should ensure that the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes and satisfies the expected input/output values.
