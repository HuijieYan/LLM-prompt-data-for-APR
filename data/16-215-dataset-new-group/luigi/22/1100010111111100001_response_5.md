The buggy function is causing a TypeError when the `prune` method is called. This is because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when we try to use it in the `prune` method, it causes an error because we cannot add `None` to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized with a valid value. We can do this by providing a default value for `last_active` in the constructor.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, ensuring that it is always initialized with a valid value.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
