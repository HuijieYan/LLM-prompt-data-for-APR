To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is initialized properly if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized using the current time if it is not provided. This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring due to attempting to perform an arithmetic operation with a `NoneType` value.
