The buggy function `__init__` is missing the condition to handle the case where `last_active` is None. The error message shows a TypeError due to attempting to add `NoneType` and `int`.

To fix this bug, a strategy is to add a condition to check if `last_active` is None and set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will handle the case where `last_active` is None and set it to the current time using `time.time()`. This will resolve the TypeError issue observed in the failing test.
