The potential error in the buggy function is that the parameter `last_active` is set to a mutable object `None` as default. This can cause unexpected behavior if the `last_active` parameter is not specified, as it will reference the same object across all instances of the class.

The cause of the bug is that the default value for `last_active` is mutable (None), and when it is referenced in the instances of the class, it leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the default value for `last_active` needs to be set to a non-mutable value, such as `None`. Then, within the `__init__` method, if `last_active` is not provided by the caller, it should be initialized to the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time() # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, the `last_active` parameter is checked to see if it is `None`. If it is `None`, then `time.time()` is used to set the default value, otherwise the provided `last_active` value is used.
