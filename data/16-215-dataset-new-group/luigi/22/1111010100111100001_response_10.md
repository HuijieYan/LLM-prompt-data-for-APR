The bug in the given function is that it does not handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is not provided, which leads to `self.last_active` being set to `None`. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to add the value of `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to adding `None` to an `int`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided. We can set it to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning action
            pass
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None`, and if it is `None`, the current time would be used to initialize `self.last_active` instead.

This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
