The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. This is causing the error when the `prune` method is called in the failing test. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because it is trying to perform the `+` operation between a `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. We can set it to the current time in seconds since epoch in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is set to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is `None`, which ensures that the `prune` method will not encounter the `TypeError` when performing the `+` operation.

Now, the failing test should pass without any errors.
