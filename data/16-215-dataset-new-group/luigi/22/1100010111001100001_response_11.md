The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set properly. It is being set to the value of the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, but if it is not provided, it should default to `None` instead of the current value of `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `last_active` parameter's default value to `None` in the function signature.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to `None` if not provided, and the failing test should now pass.
