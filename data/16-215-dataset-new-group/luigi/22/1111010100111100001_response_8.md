The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the `last_active` parameter is `None` when the `Worker` class is initialized. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called, as it attempts to perform operations with a `None` type.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition in the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. We can set a default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # if last_active is None, use current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if it is not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when calling the `prune` method.

This corrected version should resolve the issue with the failing test.
