## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default.
2. The `time.time()` function being used to initialize the `self.started` attribute.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which can cause issues in the `prune()` method call in the test. Additionally, using `time.time()` to initialize `self.started` without including any delay logic results in incorrect values for `self.started`.

## Suggested Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should provide a default value for `last_active` that is not `None` and initialize `self.started` with a value that takes into account the delay caused by the workerâ€™s initialization process.

## The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
By providing `time.time()` as the default value for `last_active` and setting `self.started` to the same value, we ensure that the `last_active` parameter is always initialized with a valid timestamp and that `self.started` reflects the correct initialization time for the worker.
