The bug in the __init__ function is that the default value of last_active is set to None, but it should be the current time if no last_active value is provided. This leads to the incorrect behavior of the function when last_active is not specified.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the __init__ function to set the value of last_active to the current time if it is not provided. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we use the time.time() function to set the value of last_active to the current time if it is not provided. This ensures that the function works correctly whether last_active is provided or not.
