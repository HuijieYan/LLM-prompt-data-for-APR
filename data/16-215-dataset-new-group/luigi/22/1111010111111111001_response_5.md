The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` parameter defaulting to `None` and then attempting to add it to an integer in the calculation. 

To fix the bug, we can set a default value for `last_active` to the current time using `time.time()` if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected version:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting a default value for `last_active` based on the current time, we ensure that it is always an integer and can be safely used in calculations. This should fix the bug and make the `prune` function work as expected.
