```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, cfg):
        # Add logic to prune workers based on worker_disconnect_delay from cfg
        pass
```
By adding an `if` statement to check if `last_active` is `None`, we can ensure that the `last_active` field will default to the current time if it is not provided, therefore fixing the bug.

This corrected function is expected to satisfy the failed test case and the expected input/output values.
