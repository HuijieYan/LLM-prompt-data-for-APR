The buggy function `__init__` has an issue where it sets the `last_active` attribute to be `None` if no value is provided. This then causes a TypeError when the `prune` method is called and tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` as it can't add `None` to an integer.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `__init__` method to use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the TypeError when calling the `prune` method.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
