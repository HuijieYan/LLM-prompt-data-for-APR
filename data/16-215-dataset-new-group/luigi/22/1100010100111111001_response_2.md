The bug in the given function is that it does not handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `last_active` is `None` before using it in any calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = 0
```
