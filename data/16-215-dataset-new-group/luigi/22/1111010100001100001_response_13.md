The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class seems to be related to the `last_active` parameter not being assigned correctly. This is evident from the fact that the `last_active` parameter is passed in as an argument, but the assignment of `self.last_active` inside the function does not take this into account.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should explicitly check if the `last_active` parameter is None and then assign the current time as the value of `self.last_active`. If `last_active` is not None, then it should be assigned to `self.last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding the conditional check for `last_active` and assigning the correct value to `self.last_active`, the bug should be fixed.
