## Analysis
The `__init__` function is the constructor for the class, but it has a potential bug in the `last_active` parameter.

## Potential error location
The potential error is in the `last_active` parameter because it is set to `None` by default.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by setting the `last_active` parameter to `None` by default, which may cause issues when trying to compare its value with other time-related operations.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can set the default value of `last_active` to `0` instead of `None`, as it is supposed to represent the seconds since the epoch. This will ensure that there is a proper default value for `last_active` and avoid potential issues when comparing time-related operations.

## The corrected version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
