The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with a `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the initialization of `last_active` to default to `None` and then set it to the value passed in, if any.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` if no value is provided, avoiding the `TypeError` during addition when the `prune` method is called with a `NoneType` `last_active`.
