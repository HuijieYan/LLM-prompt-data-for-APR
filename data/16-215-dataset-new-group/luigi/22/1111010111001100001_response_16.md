The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it improperly assigns the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` parameter is supposed to be a timestamp in seconds since epoch, but it is being directly assigned as the value of `last_active` without any conversion or validation.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `last_active` parameter is properly validated and assigned as a timestamp in seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        # Validate and convert last_active to seconds since epoch if it's not None
        try:
            self.last_active = float(last_active)  # try converting to float
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            raise ValueError("last_active must be a valid timestamp")
    else:
        self.last_active = None  # default to None if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
``` 

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly validated and converted to a float if it's not None, ensuring that it represents a valid timestamp in seconds since epoch.

This should fix the bug and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass.
