The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to the current time instead of the provided input value. As a result, the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be properly initialized based on the input value if it is provided, or set to `None` if no input value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized based on the input value, and the function should now pass the failing test.
