The bug in the function is that it is incorrectly setting the `self.started` variable to the current time using `time.time()` instead of using the provided `last_active` time if it exists.

The corrected version of the function would be:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will use the provided `last_active` time if it exists, and if it is not provided, it will use the current time. This will ensure that the `self.started` variable is initialized correctly based on the input.
