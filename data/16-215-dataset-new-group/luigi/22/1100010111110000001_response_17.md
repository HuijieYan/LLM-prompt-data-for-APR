The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is intended to initialize a worker with given `worker_id` and `last_active` time. However, the bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is given a default value of `None`, and the `prune` method in the failing test attempts to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and assign it as the current time in seconds since the epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is set to the provided value if it's not `None`, and if it is `None`, it is initialized to the current time in seconds since the epoch.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test without raising a `TypeError`.
