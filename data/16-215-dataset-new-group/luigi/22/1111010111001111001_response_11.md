The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned. The `last_active` parameter is not being used to initialize the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute using the `last_active` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized using the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, otherwise it defaults to the current time.

Now, the `Worker` class should function as expected and pass the failing test.
