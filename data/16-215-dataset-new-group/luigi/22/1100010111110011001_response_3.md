The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and then it is used in a comparison with an integer value in the `prune` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` that is not `None` and ensure that it is always initialized with a valid integer value. We can use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # pruning logic
            pass
```

This corrected version initializes `last_active` with the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid integer value. This will fix the `TypeError` that was occurring in the original buggy code.
