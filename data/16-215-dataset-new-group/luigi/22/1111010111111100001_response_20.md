The bug occurs in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, and when the `prune` method is called with a `config` object, it attempts to add the `last_active` to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in a `TypeError` because `None` cannot be added to an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value. The default value should be 0, assuming that if the `last_active` is not provided, the worker's activity would be considered as 0 seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = 0  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` and if that's the case, it's set to 0. This ensures that the `prune` method will work correctly without throwing a `TypeError`.
