The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to `self.last_active` correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being used to initialize `self.last_active`, resulting in it being set to `None` by default.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be used to initialize `self.last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
