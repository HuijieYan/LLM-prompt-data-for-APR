The buggy function is an __init__ method of a class, which is used to initialize the attributes of the class object. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The 'self.id' attribute might cause a conflict with the built-in id function in Python.
2. The 'self.last_active' and 'self.started' attributes are initialized with the same value, which is likely not the intended behavior.
3. The 'self.tasks' attribute is initialized as an empty set, but there is no indication of its purpose or how it should be used.
4. The 'self.info' attribute is initialized as an empty dictionary, but there is no indication of its purpose or how it should be used.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the 'self.id' attribute name might cause a conflict with the built-in id function in Python, and the 'self.last_active' and 'self.started' attributes are being initialized with the same value, which might not be the intended behavior.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to change the attribute 'self.id' to a different name that does not conflict with built-in functions, and to review the purpose of the 'self.tasks' and 'self.info' attributes to ensure they are initialized correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.worker_id = worker_id  # use a different attribute name to avoid conflict with built-in id function
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = []  # initialize as a list instead of a set
    self.info = {}  # initialize as an empty dictionary

```
