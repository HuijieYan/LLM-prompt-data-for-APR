To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized in the `__init__` function. Currently, it has a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` function.

We can fix this by providing a default value of `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that `last_active` defaults to the current time if not provided, preventing the `TypeError` when attempting to perform arithmetic operations with it in the `prune` function.
