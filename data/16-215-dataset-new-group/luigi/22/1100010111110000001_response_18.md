The bug in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` attribute being set to `None` in the `__init__` method. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always set to a valid timestamp in the `__init__` method. Additionally, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` in the `prune` method to prevent the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

And the corrected version of the `prune` method:
```python
def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning operations
        pass
```
By initializing `last_active` with the current time if it's `None` in the `__init__` method, we ensure that it is always a valid timestamp. Additionally, in the `prune` method, we check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison with the current time to avoid the `TypeError`.


With these corrections, the `prune` method will now handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
