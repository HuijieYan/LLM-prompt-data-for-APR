The issue with the original implementation is that it incorrectly initializes the `last_active` attribute with `None` if no value is provided. This causes the `prune` method to fail because it doesn't handle `last_active` being `None`.

To fix this, we can update the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is `None` and assign the current time as the value if it is. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
