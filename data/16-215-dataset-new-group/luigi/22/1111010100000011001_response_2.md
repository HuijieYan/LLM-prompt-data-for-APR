## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # The corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version of the function initializes the variables `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` as specified in the expected input/output values. The function now correctly sets the `worker_id` to `self.id`, sets `last_active` to the input parameter `last_active` (if provided), sets `started` to the current time, and initializes `tasks` and `info` to an empty set and dictionary, respectively.
