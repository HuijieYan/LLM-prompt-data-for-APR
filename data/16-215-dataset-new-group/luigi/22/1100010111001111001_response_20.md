To fix the buggy function, we need to correct the initialization of the `self.started` variable to use the provided `last_active` parameter if it's not None. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.started = last_active
    else:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This fix ensures that the `self.started` variable is initialized correctly based on the provided `last_active` parameter. With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the function's output should match the expected values and types in all test cases.
