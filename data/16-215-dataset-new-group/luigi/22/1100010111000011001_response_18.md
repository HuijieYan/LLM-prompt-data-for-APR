The issue with the `__init__` function in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is that `last_active` is being set as a default mutable argument, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, `last_active` is assigned the value of `time.time()` only if it is `None`, otherwise, it retains its provided value.

This should resolve the issue, and the function should now pass the failing test.
