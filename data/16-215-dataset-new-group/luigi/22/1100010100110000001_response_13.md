## Potential Error Locations
The potential error is occurring at the line:
```python
if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
```
This line is trying to add a `NoneType` (self.last_active) to an `int` (config.worker_disconnect_delay).

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `last_active` parameter defaults to None in the `__init__` function, and when the prune method is called, it tries to add `None` with an integer, causing a TypeError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if it is not provided when the Worker is instantiated.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
```
