The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is causing a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called. The error is due to the fact that `self.last_active` is initially set to `None`, and it is then being used in a comparison in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` has a default value that can be used in the comparison. It seems that the intention is for `last_active` to default to the current time if no value is provided. However, in the current implementation, if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None` which causes the error.

We can fix this by explicitly checking if `last_active` is `None` and setting it to the current time if so. Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `Worker` class should be able to handle cases where `last_active` is not provided, and the `prune` method should no longer encounter the `TypeError`.
