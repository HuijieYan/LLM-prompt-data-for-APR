The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is not getting assigned correctly. 

The `last_active` parameter is being assigned to `self.last_active`, but it is not being initialized at the time of calling the function. Since `last_active` has a default value of `None`, this is causing the issue. 

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` to the value of `last_active` if it is not None. Otherwise, we can initialize it to `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
