The issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to `None` by default in the function definition, and it is not being properly handled when comparing with `time.time()` in the `prune` method. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform the addition.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and possibly set it to a default value when it is not provided. Additionally, we need to consider the case when `last_active` is not provided and handle it properly in the comparison in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:  # Check if last_active is provided
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # set to current time if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation
            pass
```

With this corrected version, we handle the case where `last_active` is not provided and set it to the current time in the `__init__` method. Then, in the `prune` method, we can safely compare `self.last_active` with `time.time()` without getting a `TypeError`.
