The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the Worker class in the luigi/scheduler.py file. The error occurs when the `prune` method is called on a Worker object and tries to add NoneType to an integer using the `+` operator. This suggests that the `last_active` variable is not being properly initialized.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is set to a default value of None. When the `prune` method is called, it tries to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` from the `config` object to `last_active`, and since `last_active` is None, it raises a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method that is compatible with the addition operation performed in the `prune` method. We can use the current time as the default value for `last_active`, ensuring that it's always a float value.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
This corrected version ensures that `last_active` always has a valid time value, preventing the TypeError in the `prune` method.
