The issue with the current __init__ function is that it's not creating a `Worker` object properly. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a `prune` method defined for the `Worker` class.

Here's a corrected version of the `Worker` class with the `prune` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the __init__ function
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if time.time() - self.last_active > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            # Perform the pruning action here
            pass
```

With this corrected version, the `worker` object will be created properly, and the `prune` method can be called without any issues. This should fix the failing test.
