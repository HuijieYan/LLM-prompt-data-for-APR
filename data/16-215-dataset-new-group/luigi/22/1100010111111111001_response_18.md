The bug in the `__init__` function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we can set a default value for `last_active` which is not `None`. We can set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

The default value for `last_active` is now set to the current time, and this should prevent the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
