The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The default argument `last_active=None` in the `__init__` method could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The assignment `self.started = time.time()` will always set the `started` attribute to the current time when the object is created, which may not be the desired behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not handled correctly if it is not provided, and the `started` attribute is set to the current time when the object is created, which may not be intended.

To fix the bug, we can remove the default argument for `last_active` and calculate the `started` time only when the worker becomes active.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def start_work(self):
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch

    def finish_work(self):
        # perform any necessary cleanup or finalization
        pass
```

In this corrected version, the `start_work` method is used to set the `started` time when the worker starts working, and the `last_active` parameter is required to be provided when creating a new `Worker` object.
