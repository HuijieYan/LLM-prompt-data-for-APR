The bug in the `__init__` function is that it allows `last_active` to default to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when it's used in a calculation. The error occurs when the `prune` method calls `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to assign a default value of 0 to `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a default value of 0 for `last_active`, we ensure that it will always be an integer and can be used in calculations without resulting in a `TypeError`.
