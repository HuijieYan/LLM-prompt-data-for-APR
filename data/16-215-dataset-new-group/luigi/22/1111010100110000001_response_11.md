The bug in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` attribute being initialized with a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class.

The bug occurs when the `prune` method tries to add the configuration's `worker_disconnect_delay` to the `last_active` time. Since `last_active` is initially `None`, it causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with an integer.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should be modified to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided and set it to the current time similar to how `self.started` is set.

Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the bug fixed:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Delete the worker
            pass
```
By making this change, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if no value is provided. This ensures that the addition operation in the `prune` method will always have a valid timestamp to work with, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
