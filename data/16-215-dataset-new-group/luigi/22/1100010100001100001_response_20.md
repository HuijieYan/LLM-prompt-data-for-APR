The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to the value of the `last_active` input parameter if it is provided. Instead, it is always set to `None`, ignoring the input value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `last_active` assignment to check if the `last_active` input parameter is provided, and if so, use that value instead of setting it to `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will be set to the input value if provided, otherwise it will default to the current time. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `last_active` value is correctly initialized in the function.
