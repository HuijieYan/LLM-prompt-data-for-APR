The bug occurs in the __init__ function of the Worker class in the luigi/scheduler.py file. The bug is causing a TypeError during the test_worker_prune_after_init test in the scheduler_test.py file when calling the worker.prune method. The error occurs because the last_active attribute is set to None by default, and when trying to add it to the worker_disconnect_delay value in the prune method, it causes a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that last_active is initialized to the current time if it is not provided as an argument when creating a Worker instance.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the last_active attribute will default to the current time if not provided, ensuring that the TypeError will not occur when calling the prune method. This should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
