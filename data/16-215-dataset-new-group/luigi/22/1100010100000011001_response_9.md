The issue with the `__init__` function is that it is missing the `self` parameter at the beginning of the function definition. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

The fix involved adding the `self` parameter at the beginning of the function definition. With this fix, the function will correctly initialize the instance variables when a new object of the class is created.
