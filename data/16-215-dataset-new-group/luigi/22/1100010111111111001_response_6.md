The bug in the provided code is that it doesn't handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` before performing the addition operation. We can do this by setting a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is `None`, allowing for proper computation of the worker's last active time.

This should solve the `TypeError` issue when running the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
