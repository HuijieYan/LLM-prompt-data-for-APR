The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that it is initializing the `last_active` attribute incorrectly. It is using the value passed as an argument, which may be `None`, instead of using the current time if the value is not provided.

To fix this bug, we should update the `__init__` method to check if `last_active` is None, and if so, set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if it is not provided, and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass with the expected values.
