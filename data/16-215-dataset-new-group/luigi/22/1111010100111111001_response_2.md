The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is defaulting to `None` in the `__init__` method, and then the `prune` method is attempting to add an integer to `None` without any checks.

To fix this, the `last_active` parameter should default to the current time when it is None. This can be achieved by modifying the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time when it is None, preventing the TypeError when adding integers to `None`.
