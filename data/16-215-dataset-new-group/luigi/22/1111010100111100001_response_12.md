The bug in the `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` variable being set to `None` as its default value, and then an attempt to add an integer value to it in the `prune` method. This results in a `TypeError` because `None` is not compatible with `int` for addition.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that a default value is set for `last_active` that is compatible with addition (i.e., an integer or float).

Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # set to current time if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By checking if `last_active` is not `None` and setting it to the current time if it is, we ensure that `last_active` is always an integer or float, allowing addition operations without raising a `TypeError`.
