The buggy function __init__ in the scheduler.py file is not correctly initializing the worker object. The issue seems to be with the initialization of the last_active attribute and the usage of time.time() to set the started attribute.

The cause of the bug is that when the prune method is called in the failing test, it expects the last_active attribute to be set, but it's not being initialized properly in the __init__ method.

To fix the bug, the last_active attribute should be initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch if it's not provided, and the started attribute should be set to the provided last_active time or the current time if last_active is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = self.last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass as the last_active attribute is correctly initialized.
