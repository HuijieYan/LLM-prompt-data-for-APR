The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It is responsible for initializing the worker object with the provided `worker_id` and optional `last_active` time.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The default value for `last_active` is set to `None`, which can lead to inconsistencies if not handled properly.
2. The `last_active` and `started` attributes are set with the current time using `time.time()`.

The cause of the bug is that if `last_active` is not provided, it will default to `None`, and this inconsistency may cause unexpected behavior when the worker's activity is being tracked.

To fix the bug, we should initialize `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided. Additionally, we can make use of Python's `datetime` module to handle time-related operations more effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time
import datetime

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
            
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we have used `time.time()` to set `last_active` only if it is not provided. This ensures that `last_active` is initialized to the current time if a value is not provided.
