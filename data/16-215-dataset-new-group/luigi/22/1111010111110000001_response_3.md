The buggy function `__init__()` in the `Worker` class is causing an error because it sets the `last_active` attribute to `None` by default, and then tries to perform an addition operation with it in the `prune` method. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, the default value of `last_active` should be set to the current time in seconds since the epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time in seconds since the epoch if no value is provided, resolving the `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations with it.
