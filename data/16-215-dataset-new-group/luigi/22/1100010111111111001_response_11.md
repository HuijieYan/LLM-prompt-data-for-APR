The bug in the `__init__` function is that it does not handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. This causes the error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` because it is trying to add `None` to an integer.

To fix the bug, we can provide a default value for `last_active` if it is `None`, using the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value using the current time. This should resolve the TypeError and make the failing test pass.
