The problem with the buggy function is that it initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`, but then it never updates it with the provided value. This causes the `prune` method to fail because it relies on the `last_active` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `last_active` attribute with the provided `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # update last_active with the provided value or the current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the provided value if it is not `None`, otherwise, it will be initialized with the current time.

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
