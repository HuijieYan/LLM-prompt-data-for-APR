## Corrected Version

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

## Explanation
The potential error location in the original buggy function is the `last_active` parameter. If `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`, and then `time.time()` is used to set the current time. This results in the `last_active` being set to the current time rather than `None` if not provided explicitly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
We can use a conditional expression to check if `last_active` is provided and only set it to `time.time()` if it's not provided. This way, the default behavior will be to set `last_active` to the current time if it's not provided.

In the corrected version, I used the conditional expression `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()` to achieve this behavior.
