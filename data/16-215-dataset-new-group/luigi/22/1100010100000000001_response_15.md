The buggy function is a constructor for a worker object in a scheduler module. It initializes various attributes of the worker, including its ID, reference, last active time, start time, tasks, and info.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect initialization of last_active and started attributes.
2. Potential incorrect handling of time-related operations.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the last_active attribute is being set to None when it should be initialized with the current time if no last_active time is provided. Additionally, the started attribute is being set to the current time without considering the last_active time.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to properly initialize the last_active and started attributes based on the provided last_active time or the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, the last_active attribute is properly initialized based on the provided last_active time or the current time, and the started attribute is always set to the current time. This should fix the bug and ensure that the worker object is initialized correctly.
