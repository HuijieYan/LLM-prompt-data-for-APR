## Fixing the Bug

1. Analyze the Error:
   - The error message indicates a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for the addition of `self.last_active` (which is initialized as None) and the worker_disconnect_delay (an int).
   
2. Potential Error Locations:
   - The error is likely occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, specifically when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is initialized as None) to an integer value.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug is caused by initializing `last_active` as None in the `__init__` function. When the `prune` method tries to add the `last_active` to an integer value, it results in a TypeError due to the unsupported operand types.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - Initialize `last_active` with time.time() if it is not provided when creating an instance of the `Worker`. This will ensure that `last_active` is an integer value representing the seconds since epoch, and the TypeError will be avoided when performing addition operations in the `prune` method.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}


def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform pruning logic here
```

By initializing `last_active` with `time.time()` if it is not provided, the TypeError due to unsupported operand types will be resolved, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
