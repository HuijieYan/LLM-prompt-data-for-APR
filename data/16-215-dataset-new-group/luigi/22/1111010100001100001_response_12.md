## Explanation
The buggy function `__init__` is intended to initialize the `Worker` class with the provided `worker_id` and `last_active` timestamp. However, the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. Instead, it is being assigned to the `self.started` attribute.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the correct attribute `self.last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
