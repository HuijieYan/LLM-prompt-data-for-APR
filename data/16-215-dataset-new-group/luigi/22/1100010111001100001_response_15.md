The issue with the current buggy function is that it does not take into account the 'last_active' parameter when it is provided as input. This results in 'self.last_active' being set to the default value of None, instead of the provided value.

To fix this, we need to modify the __init__ function to handle the 'last_active' parameter correctly when it is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the 'last_active' parameter is checked, and if it is provided, it will be used to initialize 'self.last_active'. If it is not provided, the current time will be used as the default value.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
