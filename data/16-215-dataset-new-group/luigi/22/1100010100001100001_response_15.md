The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the class. The `last_active` parameter is being ignored and the default value `None` is being used instead.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:  # check if last_active is provided
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we added a condition to check if the `last_active` is provided and only then assign it to the `self.last_active` attribute. Otherwise, it will default to `None` as before.
