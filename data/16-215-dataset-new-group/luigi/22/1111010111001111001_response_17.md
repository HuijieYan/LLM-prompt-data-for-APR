The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being used properly to initialize the `last_active` attribute of the class. Instead, the `started` attribute is being initialized with the current time, and `last_active` is not being used at all.

The bug causes the `last_active` attribute to always be set to `None`, regardless of the value passed to the `__init__` function.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `last_active` attribute with the `last_active` parameter, and remove the initialization of the `started` attribute since it's not necessary in the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute will be properly initialized with the value passed to the `__init__` function.

This corrected version of the `__init__` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
