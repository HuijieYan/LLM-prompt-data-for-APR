The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is intended to represent seconds since epoch, but it is not being handled correctly. The `last_active` parameter is expected to be passed in as seconds since epoch, but it is also set to `None` by default. Since it is being used as a timestamp, it should be initialized to a valid timestamp (e.g., 0) instead of `None`.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should be checked for `None` and if it is `None`, it should be initialized to a valid timestamp (e.g., 0).

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0  # default to 0 if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we added an `if` statement to check if `last_active` is `None`. If it is, we initialize it to 0; otherwise, we use the value passed in as seconds since epoch.
