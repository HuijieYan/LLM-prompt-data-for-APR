## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because we are trying to add an integer to a NoneType. This happens on line 245 of the luigi/scheduler.py file in the prune method.

The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. It initializes the worker with a worker_id, last_active time, and some other attributes. The bug is likely in the initialization of last_active.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely in the initialization of the last_active attribute in the __init__ method. It is set to a default value of None, and this is causing the issue when trying to perform an operation on it.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the last_active attribute is not being correctly initialized. It is being set to None, but then used in the prune method without being properly handled.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to initialize the last_active attribute properly, so it is a valid value that can be compared and used in calculations.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune worker
            pass
```

In this corrected version, the last_active attribute is initialized using a ternary operator to ensure that it is given a valid value. If last_active is not provided, it defaults to the current time. This ensures that there will be no NoneType errors when using last_active in the prune method.
