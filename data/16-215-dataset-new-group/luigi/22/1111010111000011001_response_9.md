```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
With the corrected version of the `__init__` function, the last_active parameter is set to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it is always initialized correctly.

This should resolve the issue with the failing test function `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
