```python
import time

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when trying to perform an arithmetic operation with `None`, a `TypeError` is raised. To fix this, we can modify the function to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` when trying to calculate the time since it was last active.

The corrected version of the function initializes the `last_active` parameter without performing any arithmetic operation with it, thereby resolving the TypeError issue.
