The bug is caused by the fact that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` function, and the code does not handle this case when calculating the pruning time.

To fix this bug, we can check if `last_active` is `None` before trying to use it in the pruning logic and default it to the current time if it is.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is defaulted to the current time if it is `None`, ensuring that the pruning logic does not encounter a `NoneType` error when trying to use it in comparisons.
