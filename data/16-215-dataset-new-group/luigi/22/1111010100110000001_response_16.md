The bug occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the addition operation is being performed on a `NoneType` and an `int`.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class is initialized with a default value of `None`. When the `prune` method is called, it attempts to perform an addition operation using this `None` value and the `worker_disconnect_delay` from the `config`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` has a valid value when the `prune` method is called. We can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method that will represent the time the worker was last active.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method and the `prune` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the desired pruning operation
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if no value is provided when the worker object is created. This ensures that there will not be any `NoneType` errors when performing operations with `last_active`.
