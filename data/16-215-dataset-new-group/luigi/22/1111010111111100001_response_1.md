The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is causing a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called with the `config` parameter. The root cause of the issue is that the `last_active` parameter is defaulting to `None` when no value is provided, and the code attempts to perform addition with it in the `prune` method. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By defaulting `last_active` to `time.time()` if no value is provided, we ensure that the `prune` method no longer encounters a `TypeError` when attempting to perform addition with `last_active`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
