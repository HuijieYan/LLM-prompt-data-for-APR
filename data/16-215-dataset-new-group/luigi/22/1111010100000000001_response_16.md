## Potential Error Locations
1. The `last_active` parameter is given a default value of `None`, which might cause issues if it's not handled correctly.
2. The `started` attribute is being set to the current time using `time.time()` which could cause discrepancies if the worker is instantiated over a long period of time.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is given a default value of `None`, which may cause issues when tracking the worker's activity. Additionally, setting the `started` attribute to the current time using `time.time()` may cause discrepancies in the time tracking.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if `last_active` is `None` and if so, set it to the value of `time.time()` to track the worker's last activity correctly.
2. Consider using `time.monotonic()` instead of `time.time()` for tracking the worker's start time to avoid discrepancies.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.monotonic()  # seconds since the epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
