The problem lies in the fact that the `last_active` parameter is optional and can be `None`, as specified by the `last_active=None` in the function signature. The error message indicates that the code is trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, but the latter is `None`, which causes a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set it to a default value to avoid the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will check if `last_active` is `None` and, if so, set it to the current time using `time.time()`. This will ensure that any subsequent operations involving `last_active` will not result in a `TypeError`, and the failing test case will pass.
