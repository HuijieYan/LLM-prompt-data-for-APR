The issue with the buggy code is that the `last_active` parameter can be passed as `None`, and the buggy `prune` method is trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it which results in a `TypeError`. This happens because a `NoneType` is not compatible with the `int` data type.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `prune` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`. We can check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Prune the worker
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the `last_active` parameter in the `prune` method to ensure that it is not `None` before trying to perform any further operations on it. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
