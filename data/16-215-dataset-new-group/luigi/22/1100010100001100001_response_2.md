The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly initializing the last_active and started variables. The last_active variable is being set correctly to the input parameter last_active, but the started variable is always being set to the current time using time.time().

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the started variable is only set to time.time() if last_active is not provided. If last_active is provided, then started should be set to the same value as last_active.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    if last_active is not None:
        self.started = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the started variable will correctly be initialized based on the value of last_active, and the function should work as intended.
