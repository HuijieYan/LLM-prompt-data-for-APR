## Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types for `+`, specifically 'NoneType' and 'int'.

## Identification
The error is occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, then used in the `prune` method without checking for its existence. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to perform operations on `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Initialize `last_active` with the current time in seconds since epoch instead of `None` in the `__init__` method. This will ensure that `last_active` always has a valid integer value when creating a `Worker` instance.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
