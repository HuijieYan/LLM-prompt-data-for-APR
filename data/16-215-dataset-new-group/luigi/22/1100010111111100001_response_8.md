The issue is that the `last_active` parameter is being initialized as None in the `__init__` function, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to a `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is None and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is assigned the current time if it is None.

After making this change, the failing test should pass.
