In the buggy function `__init__()`, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and then it is used in the `prune()` function without being checked for its value. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` is `None` before using it in the `prune()` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            self.delete()
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if `self.last_active` is not `None` before using it in the `prune()` function. This prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring in the buggy version.
