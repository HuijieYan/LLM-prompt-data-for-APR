## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message.

The buggy function `__init__` is part of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `prune` method when trying to add a `NoneType` and an `int`. This error occurs because `last_active` is initially set to `None` in the `__init__` method.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.

The potential error comes from initializing `last_active` with `None` and then attempting to perform arithmetic operations on it in the `prune` method.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the buggy class docs, the corresponding error message.

The cause of the bug is that when the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None`, it causes an error when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method. The `prune` method is meant to delete workers that haven't sent any signals for a while, and this error prevents it from working correctly.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method instead of initializing it with `None`. This default value should be an integer representing the time since epoch.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world (currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:  # Set a default value if last_active is None
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By setting the default value for `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is `None`, we ensure that it is an integer and can be used in arithmetic operations in the `prune` method. This should fix the bug and allow the `prune` method to work as intended.
