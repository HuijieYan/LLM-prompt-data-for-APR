The buggy function `__init__` is causing an issue when the `prune` method is called in the failing test. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types for addition.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method tries to add the worker disconnect delay to it, it raises a `TypeError` because `None` is not a valid operand for addition with an integer.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method should default to the current time if no value is specified. This will ensure that the `last_active` attribute is always initialized with a valid integer value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform prune action
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called. This should pass the failing test.
