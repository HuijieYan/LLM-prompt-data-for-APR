The issue with this code is that the `last_active` parameter is optional and can have a value of `None`. However, in the `prune` method, it is being used in an operation without being checked for a valid value, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to a `NoneType`.

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform necessary pruning actions
            pass
```

With this change, the `prune` method will only perform the operation if `last_active` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` caused by unsupported operand types.
