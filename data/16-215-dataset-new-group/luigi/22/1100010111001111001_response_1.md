The bug in the __init__ function is that it initializes the self.started variable with the current time using time.time(), which is causing the failing test due to the inconsistency in the expected and actual values of self.started. The expected value is not always the same as the actual value due to the time difference.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the initialization of self.started from the __init__ function and let it be initialized when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
The corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
