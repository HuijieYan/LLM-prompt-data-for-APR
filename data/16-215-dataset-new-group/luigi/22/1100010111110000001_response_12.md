The issue in the buggy code is that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None`, but the `prune` method is trying to add this `None` value to an integer. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and `int`.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `last_active` with a default value of `0` instead of `None`. This will ensure that the `prune` method can safely add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # initialize last_active with a default value of 0
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the provided failing test should pass without raising a `TypeError`.
