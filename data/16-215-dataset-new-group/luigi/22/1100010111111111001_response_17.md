The bug in the function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`. 

To fix the bug, we can set a default value for `last_active` and use that value in the comparison instead of directly using `self.last_active`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version sets the default value of `last_active` to `time.time()` if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid timestamp.
