The potential error location is in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. Specifically, the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.

The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` in the `__init__` method. When trying to add `None` to an integer in the `prune` method, it results in a `TypeError`. The input `config.worker_disconnect_delay` is assumed to be an integer representing a time delay in seconds.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `last_active` parameter to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided. This will ensure that it is always an integer and can be used in calculations without causing a `TypeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always an integer and can be used in calculations without causing a `TypeError`.
