The buggy function is failing because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is assigned a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to compare it with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter defaults to the provided value only if no value is explicitly passed. We can achieve this by modifying the `__init__` method as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:  # Check if last_active is explicitly passed
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # Set to current time if no value is passed
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if `last_active` is not explicitly passed during the creation of a `Worker` object, it defaults to the current time.

With this change, the updated `__init__` method should resolve the `TypeError` issue and produce the expected output for the failing test case.
