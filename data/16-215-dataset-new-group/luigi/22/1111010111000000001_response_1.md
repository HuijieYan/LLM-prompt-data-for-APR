The buggy function is the `__init__` method within the `Worker` class. The buggy function initializes a worker with a `worker_id` and `last_active` parameter. The bug occurs when the `last_active` parameter is not provided, as it defaults to `None`. This causes a problem when the `prune` method is called on the `worker` object in the test function, as it expects the `last_active` attribute to be initialized with a value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided. We should initialize it to the current time in seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided, preventing the bug encountered in the failing test case.
