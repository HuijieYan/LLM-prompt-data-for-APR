The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` variable is set to `None` by default, and the function fails to handle this correctly when it tries to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid value so that it can be used in the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `last_active` to the current time if it's `None`, we ensure that it always has a valid value for comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
