## Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which is used for initializing a new instance of the `Worker` class. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the parameters `last_active=None` and `self.started = time.time()`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `__init__` method is that the default value for the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, and the `self.started` attribute is initialized using `time.time()` to get the current time in seconds since the epoch. This could cause a bug because if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`, which may not be consistent with the actual start time of the worker.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should set the default value of `last_active` to the result of `time.time()` at the beginning of the `__init__` method. This will ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it will default to the current time in seconds since the epoch.

## The Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
