The bug in the provided code is that when `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to `None`, and the function `prune` tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`. However, in the case where `last_active` is None, this causes a TypeError because you cannot add an integer to `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is None and handle that case accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        pass  # Add your logic for pruning workers here
```

With this fix, the `prune` method checks if `self.last_active` is not None before comparing it with `time.time() + config.worker_disconnect_delay`. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring before.
