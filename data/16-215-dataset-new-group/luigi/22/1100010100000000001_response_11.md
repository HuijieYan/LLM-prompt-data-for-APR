## Analysis:
The buggy function is a constructor for a class. It initializes various attributes of the class instance.

## Potential error locations:
1. The use of the reserved keyword `self` as an attribute name (`self.id`).
2. There is no error handling for the `last_active` parameter which could potentially lead to an error if an invalid value is passed.
3. The `time.time()` function is called without any error handling, which could potentially cause issues if the function call fails.

## Cause of the bug:
The use of reserved keywords and lack of error handling for input parameters and function calls can lead to unexpected behavior and potential runtime errors.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different attribute name instead of the reserved keyword `self`.
2. Add error handling for the `last_active` parameter to handle invalid values.
3. Add error handling for the `time.time()` function call to handle potential failures.

## Corrected version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.worker_id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        try:
            self.last_active = float(last_active)  # seconds since epoch
        except ValueError:
            self.last_active = None  # default value for invalid input
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
