The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None` and is not being properly initialized when a value is provided. This is causing an issue when the `prune` function is called on the `Worker` object.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized to the provided value if it is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly initialized to the provided value if it is not `None`, and if it is `None`, it will default to the current time. This should fix the bug and allow the `prune` function to work correctly.
