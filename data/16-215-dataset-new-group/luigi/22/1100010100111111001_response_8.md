The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where `last_active` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `None`. To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing `self.last_active` to 0 if it is None, we ensure that it is always a valid value to perform arithmetic operations on. This should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
