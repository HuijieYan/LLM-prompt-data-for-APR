```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # Add logic here
```
The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter can be `None` and the code does not handle this case properly. I have modified the code to check if `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if this is the case. This way, we ensure that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp.

The corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
