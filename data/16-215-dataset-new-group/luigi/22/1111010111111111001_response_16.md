By analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it is clear that the issue lies in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and the buggy function tries to perform an operation on it without checking if it is None.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is None before using it in calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method will now handle the `last_active` parameter properly, ensuring that it defaults to the current time if it is None, which should fix the issue with the failing test.
