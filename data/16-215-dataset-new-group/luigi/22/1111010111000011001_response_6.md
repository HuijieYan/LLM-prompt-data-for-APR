```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The bug in the original code is that the `last_active` parameter is not handled properly. When `last_active` is not provided, it should default to the current time using `time.time()`. However, in the original code, the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled and it does not default to the current time.

To fix the bug, I have added a condition in the `__init__` function to properly handle the default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if it is not provided.
