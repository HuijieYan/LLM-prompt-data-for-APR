To fix the bug in the function, we need to update the assignment of the `self.started` variable to use the provided `last_active` parameter instead of the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the provided `last_active` parameter to initialize `self.started`, this will ensure that the `self.started` value reflects the provided `last_active` value when it's available, or defaults to the current time when `last_active` is not provided.
