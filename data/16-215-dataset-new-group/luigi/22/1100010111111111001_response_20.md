The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file initializes a `Worker` object with the `last_active` attribute, but the `last_active` attribute defaults to `None`. The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` in the `test/scheduler_test.py` file attempts to call the `prune` method on a `Worker` object, which uses the `last_active` attribute without checking if it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` because it is attempting to add `None` to an integer.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` function should handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and assign a default value that can be added to an integer.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This correction checks if `last_active` is `None`. If it is, then it assigns the current time using `time.time()`, otherwise, it uses the provided `last_active` value.

The corrected version of the `__init__` function aligns with the expected behaviour, and it would pass the failing test.
