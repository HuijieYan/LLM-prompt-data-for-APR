The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` variable is initialized with a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when it is used in an arithmetic operation in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we should initialize `last_active` with the current time when it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` variable will be initialized with the current time if it is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.

Using this corrected version of the function, it will now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
