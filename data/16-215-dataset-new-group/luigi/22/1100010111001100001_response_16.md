The bug in the `__init__` function is that it does not correctly initialize the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` attribute is set to `None` by default and only gets updated if an input value is provided. In the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object, which expects the `last_active` attribute to be set to a specific value. Since it is not being initialized properly, the test fails.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` attribute if a value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be properly initialized based on the input value or the current time if no value is provided, and the failing test should now pass.
