The bug in the `__init__` function is that it doesn't set the `last_active` attribute to the provided value if it is not None. This is evident from the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`, which is expecting the `last_active` attribute to be set and then used in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check in the `__init__` function to set the `last_active` attribute to the provided value if it is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the provided value if it is not None, otherwise, it will be set to the current time. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
