The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is provided as `None`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix the bug, we should provide a default value of `None` for the `last_active` parameter in the constructor and handle this case when performing pruning.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform pruning
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before trying to add the delay to it. This will prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the buggy version.
