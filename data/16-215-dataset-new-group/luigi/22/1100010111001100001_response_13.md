The bug in the provided function `__init__` is that it is not properly initializing the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` attribute should be initialized with the value provided in the `last_active` parameter, or with `None` if no value is provided.

To fix this bug, we should assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute, if the `last_active` parameter is not None.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the provided failing test should now pass without any errors.
