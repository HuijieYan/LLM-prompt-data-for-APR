The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as None, and when trying to add it to the `worker_disconnect_delay` from the `config` in the `prune` function, it raises a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for `NoneType` and `int`.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to initialize `last_active` with a default value if it is not provided.
2. We should check if `last_active` is None in the `prune` function before adding the `worker_disconnect_delay`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform the pruning logic here
```
