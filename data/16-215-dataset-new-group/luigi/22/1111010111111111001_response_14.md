```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The bug was caused by not handling the case where the `last_active` parameter is `None` in the `__init__` method. The suggested fix includes checking if `last_active` is not None, and if so, setting `self.last_active` to the given value. Otherwise, it sets `self.last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`.

This fix ensures that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time, preventing a `NoneType` error when adding the disconnect delay in the `prune` method.
