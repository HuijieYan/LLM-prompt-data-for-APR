The issue with the buggy function `__init__` is that it does not handle the case where `last_active` is None. This causes the error when the `prune` method is called because it tries to perform an unsupported operation of adding an integer to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is None and handle it accordingly by setting a default value. 

Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class with the fixed `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch, use current time as default
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the `NoneType` error when calling the `prune` method.
