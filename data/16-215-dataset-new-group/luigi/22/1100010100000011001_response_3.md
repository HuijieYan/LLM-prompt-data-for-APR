```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
The issue with the original code is that there is no class definition around the init function. I added the class definition and corrected the indentation. The corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values.
