The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in `luigi/scheduler.py`. The `last_active` argument is set to `None` as a default value, and the error message indicates that the `last_active` is of type `NoneType` and cannot be added to an integer.

The cause of the bug is that when the `last_active` argument is not provided, it defaults to `None`, and then it is used in the `prune` method without checking if it is `None` or not.

To fix this bug, we should check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = 0  # set to a default value
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, when `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to a value of 0. This will prevent the TypeError that was raised in the failing test.
