## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Explanation:
The issue with the original function is that it always sets the `last_active` attribute to the current time (`time.time()`) if no specific value is provided. This makes it impossible to accurately track the last active time of the worker.

In the failing test, the `prune` method is being called with a temporary configuration `TmpCfg` with a `worker_disconnect_delay` of 10. This suggests that the intention is to set the `last_active` attribute to the current time minus the `worker_disconnect_delay`.

The corrected version of the function uses a conditional assignment to set the `last_active` attribute to the current time only if no specific value is provided. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute is initialized correctly, allowing for accurate tracking of the worker's last active time.
