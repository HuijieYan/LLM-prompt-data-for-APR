Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue is occurring in the `prune` method due to `self.last_active` being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized with a valid timestamp in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By making this change, we ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized with either the provided value or the current timestamp if no value is provided.

This should fix the bug and the `prune` method should now work correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
