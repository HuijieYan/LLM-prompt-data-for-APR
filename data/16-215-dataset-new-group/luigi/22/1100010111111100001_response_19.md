The bug in the `__init__` function is causing a TypeError in the `prune` method when trying to calculate the pruning condition. The issue lies in the `self.last_active` variable being initialized as `None` and then being used in a comparison operation with an integer value within the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` should be initialized using the `last_active` parameter if it is not None, or as `time.time()` otherwise. This will ensure that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp and avoid the TypeError in the `prune` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
With this correction, the `last_active` is initialized using the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, or using `time.time()` if it is not. This ensures that `last_active` is always a valid timestamp and should address the TypeError issue in the failing test.
