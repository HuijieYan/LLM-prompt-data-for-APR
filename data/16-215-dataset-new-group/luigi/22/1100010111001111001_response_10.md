To fix the buggy function, we need to correct the implementation of the __init__ method in the luigi/scheduler.py file. The issue with the current implementation is that the last_active parameter is not being set correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the __init__ method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding a condition to check if the last_active parameter is provided, we can set it accordingly. If it's not provided (i.e., it's None), we set it using the current time (time.time()).

With this correction, the __init__ method will set the last_active parameter based on the input value, and the failing test should pass.

This correction ensures that the last_active parameter is initialized correctly, and the test_worker_prune_after_init test case should now produce the expected output.
