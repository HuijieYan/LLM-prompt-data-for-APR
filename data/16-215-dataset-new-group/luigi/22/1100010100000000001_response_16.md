The buggy function is a constructor for a class, and it is supposed to initialize the attributes of the class. The bug in the function is the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute. The `last_active` attribute is supposed to be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, but it is currently being set to `None`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` as default.
2. No check is being performed to see if `last_active` is `None` before setting it to the current time.

The cause of the bug is that if `last_active` is not provided as an argument when creating an instance of the class, it will default to `None`. This could lead to issues when trying to perform logic based on the `last_active` attribute, as `None` is not a valid timestamp.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to check if `last_active` is `None` before setting it to the current time. If it is `None`, then set it to the current time using `time.time()`. Otherwise, leave it as the provided value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
