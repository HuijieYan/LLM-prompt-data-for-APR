The issue with the given function is that the `last_active` and `started` variables are not correctly being initialized. 

The `last_active` variable is being correctly assigned the input parameter value, but the `started` variable is being assigned the current time using `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we should initialize the `started` variable using the `last_active` input parameter, or if it is not provided, then using the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `started` variable will be initialized correctly based on the `last_active` input parameter, or using the current time if `last_active` is not provided.
