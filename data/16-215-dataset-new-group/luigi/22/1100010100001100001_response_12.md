The provided buggy function seems to be intended to initialize various attributes of a worker object. The issue with the function may be related to the `last_active` parameter not being properly set to the default value when `None` is passed as an argument.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to the default value of `None` when it is not provided as an argument when initializing the object. This can cause unexpected behavior when trying to compare the `last_active` attribute later on in the code.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly check if the `last_active` is `None` and then assign it to the default value of `None`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = None  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the conditional check for `None` and explicitly setting `self.last_active` to `None`, we ensure that the default value is correctly assigned when `last_active` is not provided as an argument.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized in all cases.
