The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is assigned a default value of `None`, and then it is used in the `prune` method without being checked for `None`. This causes a TypeError when trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method as indicated by the failing test and error message.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before using it in the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
    if self.last_active is None:
        self.last_active = self.started  # set default last_active to the time the worker was started
```

This fix initializes `last_active` to the value of `self.started` if it is `None`, which will prevent the `TypeError` when used in the `prune` method.
