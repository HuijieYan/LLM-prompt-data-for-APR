The bug in the `__init__` function is that the default value for the `last_active` parameter should not be set to `None`. This causes an error when `prune` is called on the `Worker` object. 

The corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `Worker` object will be initialized with a default `last_active` value of the current time when not provided, and the `prune` method will work as expected.

The test case should now pass as expected.
