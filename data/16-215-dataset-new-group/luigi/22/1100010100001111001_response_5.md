The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to `self.last_active`. Instead, it is being assigned to `self.started`. 

To fix the bug, the assignment of `last_active` to `self.started` needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the input parameters are correctly assigned to the corresponding variables, and the expected output values are achieved.
