The buggy function is the __init__ method of the Worker class. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The use of a mutable default argument (last_active=None) which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The use of time.time() to initialize the "started" attribute.

The cause of the bug is that the default argument last_active=None as a mutable object might lead to unexpected behavior when the method is called without providing a value for last_active. Additionally, using time.time() to initialize the "started" attribute may not provide the desired result as it will always give the current time.

To fix the bug, we can remove the default argument for last_active and initialize it inside the __init__ method to ensure it always gets a new value when an instance is created. We can also change the way the "started" attribute is initialized to get the time since epoch only once when the instance is created.


The corrected version of the buggy function is provided below:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In this corrected version, we removed the default argument for last_active and added a condition to check if last_active is None, in which case it will be initialized with the current time using time.time(). Now the last_active attribute will always have a new value when the instance is created. Additionally, we left the initialization of the "started" attribute as time.time() to get the time since epoch when the instance is created.
