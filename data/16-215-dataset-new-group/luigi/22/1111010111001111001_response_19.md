The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned the correct value. Instead, it is being set to the current time since epoch. This is resulting in the incorrect values at the function's return.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is assigned the correct value that is passed to the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:  # check if last_active is provided
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # set last_active to current time since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be set to the provided value if it exists, otherwise it will default to the current time since epoch. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
