The potential error in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is being set to None by default. Then, the `last_active` is being set to `None`, and there is no logic in place to update `last_active` when the worker becomes active.

The bug causes the `last_active` time to be inaccurate or not updated properly.

To fix the bug, we can update the `last_active` time when the worker becomes active. We can achieve this by adding a method to update the `last_active` time when the worker performs any activity.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
        
    def update_last_active(self):
        self.last_active = time.time()
```

By adding the `update_last_active` method, we can then call this method whenever the worker performs any activity, ensuring that the `last_active` time is updated to the current time.
