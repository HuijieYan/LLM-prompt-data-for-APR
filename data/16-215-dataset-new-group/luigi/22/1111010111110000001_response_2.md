The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, and when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, there is an unsupported operand error due to the `None` value.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `last_active` with the current time instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The corrected version of the function initializes `last_active` with the current time if it's `None`, which will prevent the unsupported operand error when adding `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`.
