The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled when it is provided as an input. In the current implementation, if `last_active` is provided, it is assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute. However, if `last_active` is not provided, the default value of `None` is assigned. This causes an issue because the `prune` method is expecting `last_active` to be a valid timestamp.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is provided and if not, calculate the current time as the default value. This will ensure that the `last_active` attribute is set to a valid timestamp in all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will be properly handled, and the `prune` method should not encounter any issues related to the `last_active` attribute.
