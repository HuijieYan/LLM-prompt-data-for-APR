The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to None by default, and when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method, it causes a TypeError due to unsupported operand types.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is None by setting it to a default value when it is not provided during initialization.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is not provided, avoiding the NoneType error when used in the `prune` method. This should allow the failing test to pass.
