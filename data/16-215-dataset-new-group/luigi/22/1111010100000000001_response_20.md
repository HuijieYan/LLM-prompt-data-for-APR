## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It is used to initialize a `Worker` object with the provided `worker_id` and optional `last_active` parameter.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `last_active` parameter is assigned a default value of `None`, which is not a valid value for `last_active` as it's supposed to represent the time in seconds since the epoch.
2. The use of `time.time()` to initialize the `started` attribute might cause issues as it gets the current time, not the time when the worker was started.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `__init__` method is that it doesn't handle the `last_active` parameter correctly and initializes the `started` attribute with the current time, which may not be accurate.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Use the `time.time()` method to get the current time when `last_active` is not provided.
2. Check if the `last_active` parameter is provided and if it's not, set it to the current time.
3. If `last_active` is provided, then convert it to seconds since the epoch using `time.mktime()`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.mktime(last_active.timetuple())  # convert to seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
