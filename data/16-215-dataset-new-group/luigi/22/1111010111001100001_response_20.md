The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly. It should default to the current time in seconds since epoch if no value is provided.

To fix the bug, we should update the `__init__` method to set the `last_active` parameter to the current time if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method will now correctly set the `last_active` parameter to the current time if it is not provided, addressing the bug in the original implementation. The corrected version should pass the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.
