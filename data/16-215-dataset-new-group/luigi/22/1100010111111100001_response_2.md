The error in the `prune` method is occurring because the `self.last_active` variable is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` function. In the failing test, the `prune` method tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is an integer) to `self.last_active` which is `None`, resulting in the error.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `self.last_active` is a valid timestamp from the start. We can modify the `__init__` function to accept an optional `last_active` parameter with a default value of `None` and update it with the current time if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will be initialized with the current time if not provided explicitly, ensuring that it is always a valid timestamp.
