The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is not properly initialized, leading to failures in the test `test_worker_prune_after_init`.

The main issue with the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly initialized and does not default to `None` as expected. Instead, it is assigned the value of the provided `last_active` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default if not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to `None` if not provided, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
