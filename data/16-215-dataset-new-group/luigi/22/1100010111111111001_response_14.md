```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # do something
```
The issue with the original code is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to a `None` value. 

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if `last_active` is `None`, and set it to the current time in that case. This ensures that `self.last_active` is always a valid timestamp, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
