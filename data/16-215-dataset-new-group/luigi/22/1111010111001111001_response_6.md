```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """




    # the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that it sets self.last_active unconditionally, even if last_active is None. This results in last_active being overwritten even when it's passed as an argument. To fix this, I've added a check to only set self.last_active if last_active is not None.

With this fix, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
