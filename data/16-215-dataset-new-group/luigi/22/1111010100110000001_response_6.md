The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` during the addition operation in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This is because the `last_active` attribute could be `None` and it is being used in an addition operation with an integer. This results in an unsupported operand type error.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`, and ensure that it is treated as 0 in the addition operation.

Here is the fixed version of the `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute is checked for `None` and replaced with 0 if it is `None`. This ensures that the addition operation in the `prune` method will always have two integers to add together, preventing the `TypeError` and allowing the function to work correctly.
