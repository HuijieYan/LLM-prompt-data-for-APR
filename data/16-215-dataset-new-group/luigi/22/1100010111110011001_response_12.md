The bug in the `__init__` method is that it does not handle the case where `last_active` is `None`, which causes the error in the failing test. The failing test is attempting to call the `prune` method on a `Worker` instance and passes an instance of `TmpCfg` to the `prune` method. The `prune` method then tries to use `last_active` without checking if it is `None`, resulting in a `TypeError` when it attempts to add an `int` to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` before performing any operations on it.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0  # set to 0 if last_active is None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` is set to `0` if it is `None`, which should prevent the `TypeError` in the failing test.
