The bug in the given function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being used properly in the `__init__` method. Instead of assigning it to the `last_active` attribute of the class instance, it is directly assigned to the `last_active` parameter.

To fix this bug, we should assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute inside the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we use the `last_active` parameter if it's provided, or the current time using `time.time()` if it's not. This ensures that `self.last_active` is correctly initialized with the provided `last_active` value or the current time.
