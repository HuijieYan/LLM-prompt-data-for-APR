The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that it doesn't properly handle the `last_active` parameter. This parameter is intended to store the time in seconds since epoch, but if it is not passed as an argument, it defaults to `None`. This causes an issue when trying to use it in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize the `last_active` attribute to the current time if it is not provided as an argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version initializes the `last_active` attribute to the current time if it is not provided as an argument, which ensures that it always has a valid value and prevents any issues when using it in other methods of the `Worker` class.
