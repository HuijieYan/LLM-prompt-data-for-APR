The bug occurs in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The bug is causing the `prune` method to fail in the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` from the `test/scheduler_test.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly. It is being set to the value passed in, which is expected to be a timestamp in seconds since the epoch, but it is not being handled properly. This is leading to incorrect values being set for the `last_active` variable.

To fix this bug, we need to properly initialize the `last_active` variable in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly initialize the `last_active` variable based on the input parameter, and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass.
