The potential error in the provided function is that the default argument `last_active=None` is not being used correctly, and the `last_active` parameter is always being assigned to the value of `time.time()`.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter should be set to `None` by default if no argument is provided when the `__init__` function is called. However, the current implementation assigns the value of `time.time()` to `last_active` regardless of whether a value is provided or not.

To fix the bug, the default value of `last_active` should be set to `None` in the function definition and only assign `time.time()` to `self.last_active` if a value is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = None
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
In this corrected version, we check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and only assign the value of `last_active` if it is not `None`.
