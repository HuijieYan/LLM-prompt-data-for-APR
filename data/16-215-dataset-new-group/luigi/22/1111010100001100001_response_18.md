The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class when it is not `None`. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is not `None` and then assign it to the `last_active` attribute. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `last_active` attribute if it is not `None`, otherwise it will use the current time.
