## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    if last_active is not None:
        self.started = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

## Explanation
The cause of the bug is that the `self.started` variable is always assigned the current time using `time.time()`, regardless of whether `last_active` is None or not. This causes the `self.started` variable to always have the current time instead of the provided `last_active` time.

To fix the bug, we should check if `last_active` is None, and only then assign the current time using `time.time()` to `self.started`.

By making this change, the function will correctly set `self.started` based on the value of `last_active`, and the expected values will be satisfied.

The corrected function now checks if `last_active` is not None, and if so, assigns the value of `last_active` to `self.started`. Otherwise, it assigns the current time using `time.time()` to `self.started`, as intended.
