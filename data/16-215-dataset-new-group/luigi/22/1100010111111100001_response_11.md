The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, and then the function attempts to perform an operation with it without explicitly checking for `None` before using it in a calculation.

The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` is failing with the error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`, indicating that the `last_active` attribute is not being properly initialized.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized before performing any calculations with it. We can do this by checking if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and setting it to the current time if it is.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding the condition to check if `last_active` is `None`, we ensure that it is properly initialized before being used in any calculations. This should fix the bug and make the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` pass.
