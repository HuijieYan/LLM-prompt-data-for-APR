The issue in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` argument is set to `None` by default, but in the `prune` method, it is used in a calculation without first checking if it's `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition that checks if `last_active` is not None before performing the calculation within the `prune` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # set current time if last_active is not provided
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid value.

This should resolve the `TypeError` that was being encountered in the failing test.
