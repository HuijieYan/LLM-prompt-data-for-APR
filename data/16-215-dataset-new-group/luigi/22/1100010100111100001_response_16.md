The error occurs due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default when no value is provided. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `time.time()`. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to set `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the function will set `last_active` to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that the addition with `time.time()` does not result in a `TypeError`. This should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
