The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class is supposed to initialize the object with the given `worker_id` and set some default values for other attributes. However, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` suggests that the `prune` method is being called immediately after the worker is initialized, indicating that the `__init__` method is not setting up the object properly.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It is set to `None` by default and should be initialized to the current time in seconds since the epoch if no value is provided.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not being properly initialized, and the `prune` method expects it to be set to the current time.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized to the current time if no value is provided when creating the `Worker` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, and it should pass the failing test.
