```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if (self.last_active if self.last_active is not None else 0) + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform prune action
            pass
```

The bug was in the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. If `last_active` was not provided, it was set to `None`. However, in the `prune` method, it attempted to add a number to it, causing a `TypeError`. To fix the bug, I added a condition to set `last_active` to the current time if it was not provided.

The corrected version of the function above should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
