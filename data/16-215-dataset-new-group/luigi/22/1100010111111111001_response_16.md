The buggy function is `__init__` within the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class. The error occurs when the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is called with a `config` object.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` in the `__init__` method, and then in the `prune` method, it is trying to perform an addition operation with `self.last_active` which is `None`, and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` which is an integer. This causes a `TypeError` because the `None` object does not support addition with an integer.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter must be set to the current time if it is initially set to `None`. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is set to the current time if it is initially `None`, and the `prune` method should now work correctly with the expected input/output values.
