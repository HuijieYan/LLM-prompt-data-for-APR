## Analysis
The `__init__` method is used as the constructor in Python classes and is used to initialize the object's attributes. However, in the provided code, the `__init__` method is not properly defined, and it is missing the `self` parameter, which is required to reference the object's instance attributes.

## Identified potential error locations
1. Missing `self` parameter in the `__init__` method.
2. Inconsistent use of capital letters for the variables.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the missing `self` parameter in the `__init__` method. This prevents the constructor from correctly initializing the instance attributes of the object.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `__init__` method needs to include the `self` parameter and assign values to the instance attributes using the `self` keyword.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, the `__init__` method is properly defined within the `Scheduler` class, and it includes the `self` parameter to reference the instance attributes. Now, when an instance of the `Scheduler` class is created, the attributes will be correctly initialized.
