The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the last_active parameter is not being used to initialize the `last_active` attribute when it is provided. Instead, the `last_active` attribute is always being set to the current time by default.

To fix this bug, we should update the `__init__` function to use the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, and only set the current time if the `last_active` parameter is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be initialized with the provided value if it exists, and with the current time if it does not, resulting in the correct behavior when the `prune` method is called.
