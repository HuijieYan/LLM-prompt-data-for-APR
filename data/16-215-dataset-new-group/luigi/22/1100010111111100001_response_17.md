The bug in the provided function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an `int` to `None` in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `last_active` to the current time when it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `prune` method should no longer encounter a `TypeError` when `last_active` is `None`.

This should address the issue and ensure that the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` passes without any errors.
