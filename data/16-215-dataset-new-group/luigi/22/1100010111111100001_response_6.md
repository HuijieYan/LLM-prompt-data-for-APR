The bug in the `prune` method is due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method tries to add `worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `last_active` with the value `time.time()` if it is not provided during the initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time if it is not provided during the initialization, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
