To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized to 0 if it is not provided as an argument. This will prevent the `NoneType` error when trying to add an integer to `last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        last_active = 0
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version of the function initializes `last_active` to 0 if it is not provided, which prevents the `NoneType` error when adding an integer to it.
