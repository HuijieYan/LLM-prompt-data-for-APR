The bug in the provided code is that the variable `last_active` is set to `None` by default, but when it is used in a comparison with a number, it causes a `TypeError`. 

To fix this bug, we can initialize `last_active` to the current time when it is set to `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the code checks if `last_active` is `None`. If it is `None`, then it sets it to the current time using `time.time()`. Otherwise, it uses the provided value.

This fix ensures that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid value, and the comparison with `time.time()` will not raise a `TypeError`.
