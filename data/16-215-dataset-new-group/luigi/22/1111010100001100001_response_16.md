The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly updated when a value is provided. The `last_active` parameter is being assigned to the function's attribute `self.last_active`, but it is not being updated if a value is provided.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `last_active` attribute to the provided value, if one is given.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the provided value if one is given, otherwise it will default to the current time. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `last_active` attribute is correctly initialized.
