The bug in the provided buggy function is due to the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function will initialize `last_active` as the current time if it is not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when using it in calculations.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
