The issue in the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` is given as `None` when the `Worker` object is initialized, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` to an `int` in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we can provide a default value for `last_active` when it is not passed as an argument.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute defaults to the current time if not provided, avoiding the `NoneType` error in the `prune` method.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
