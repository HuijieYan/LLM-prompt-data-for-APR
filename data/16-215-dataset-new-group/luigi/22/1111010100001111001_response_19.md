The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function. This causes the `last_active` parameter to remain None, while it should be assigned the value passed to the function.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should be assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` function. The function will now satisfy the expected input/output values.
