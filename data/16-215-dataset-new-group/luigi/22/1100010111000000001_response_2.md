The potential issue in the buggy function is with the `prune` method that is being called in the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init`. The `prune` method likely uses the `last_active` attribute to decide if a worker needs to be pruned, but the `__init__` method doesn't initialize `last_active` correctly. As a result, the `prune` method may not work as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is initialized properly in the `__init__` method. We can set it to the current time when the worker is initialized, indicating that it was last active at the time of initialization. 

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if it's not provided during initialization. This should ensure that the `prune` method works correctly, and the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass.
