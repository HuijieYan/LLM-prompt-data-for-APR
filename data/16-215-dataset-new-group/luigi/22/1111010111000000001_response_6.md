The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The buggy function initializes worker attributes, including `last_active` and `started` timestamps.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the initialization of the `last_active` and `started` attributes.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not being correctly initialized, and the `started` attribute is being set to the current time using `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` should default to `None` in the function signature, and the `started` attribute should remain unchanged.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the provided test should pass, as the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is not directly related to the buggy function we fixed.
