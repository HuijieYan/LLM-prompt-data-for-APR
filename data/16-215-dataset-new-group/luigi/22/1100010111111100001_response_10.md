The bug in the __init__ function is that it does not set a default value for the last_active parameter, resulting in a 'NoneType' error when trying to perform arithmetic operations on it.

To fix this bug, we should assign a default value to last_active in the function signature and update the value of self.last_active accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This change ensures that if last_active is not provided, the current time will be used as the default value, preventing the 'NoneType' error.
