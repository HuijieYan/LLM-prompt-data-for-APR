The issue here is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, but it's being used in a calculation without checking for `None` first.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this change, if `last_active` is `None`, it will be replaced with `0` to prevent the TypeError when trying to add it to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method.
