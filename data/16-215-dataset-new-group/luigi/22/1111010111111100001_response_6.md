The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is incorrectly set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` method needs to be updated to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided at runtime. This can be done by assigning a default value of `None` to `last_active`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is assigned the current time if it is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
