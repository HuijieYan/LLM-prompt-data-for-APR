The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly sets the `started` attribute to the current time when the `__init__` method is called, which does not match the expected value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `started` attribute to the value of the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, or the current time if `last_active` is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `started` attribute will be set to the value of `last_active` if it is provided, and to the current time if `last_active` is not provided. This will ensure that the function passes the failing test and matches the expected input/output values.
