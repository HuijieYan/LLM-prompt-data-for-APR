The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class has an issue with the `last_active` parameter. It is set to a default value of `None`, but in the failing test, the `prune` function tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`. However, since `self.last_active` is `None`, it causes a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is set to a default value that can be used in arithmetic operations, such as `0` if no value is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter in the `Worker` class will default to `0` if no value is provided, ensuring that it can be used in arithmetic operations without causing a `TypeError`.
