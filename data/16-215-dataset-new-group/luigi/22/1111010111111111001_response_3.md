The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` and then used in the `prune` method before it gets assigned a value.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is provided, and if not, default it to 0 in the `__init__` method. We can also update the `last_active` when the worker is pruned.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
          # prune worker logic
          pass
```

By adding the default value of 0 to the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function, the bug should be fixed. Now, the `last_active` will be initialized with a valid value, and it can be safely used in the `prune` method.
