The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` defines the constructor for the Worker class. The error message is indicating a `TypeError` when trying to perform addition involving a `NoneType` and an `int`.

The potential error location is the `last_active` variable, which is being initialized with a default value of `None`. This results in the error when trying to perform addition with an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) on line 245.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` variable is being initialized with the value of `None`, and then the code tries to add an integer to it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `last_active` is `None` before trying to perform the addition.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, the `last_active` variable is initialized to 0 if its value is `None`. This way, the addition with an integer will be valid, and the error should be resolved.
