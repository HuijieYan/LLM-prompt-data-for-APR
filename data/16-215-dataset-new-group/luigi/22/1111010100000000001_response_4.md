## Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor of the `Worker` class. The function initializes the worker's attributes such as `worker_id`, `last_active`, `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info`.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error in the buggy function is the default argument `last_active=None` which might lead to unexpected behavior.

## Explanation
The issue with the default argument `last_active=None` is that if no value is supplied for `last_active` when a new `Worker` instance is created, it will default to `None`. This could cause problems if the intention was to have a default value for `last_active` as the current time when the `Worker` instance is created.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the default value for `last_active` is set to the current time when a new `Worker` instance is created.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
