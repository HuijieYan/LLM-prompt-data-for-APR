The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that it captures the value of `last_active` as a default parameter value. Since the default parameter value is assigned once when the function is defined, it captures the initial value of `last_active=None` and doesn't update when the actual `last_active` value is provided during object creation. 

To fix this bug, we should modify the default parameter `last_active=None` to be `None` and update the value inside the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` parameter will be initialized to the current time if it's not provided during object creation, ensuring that it always captures the actual time of the worker's last activity.
