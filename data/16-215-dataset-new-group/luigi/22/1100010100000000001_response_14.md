## Analysis:
The `__init__` function appears to be a constructor for a class, as it sets up initial values for the class attributes.

## Error location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The `last_active` parameter is set to `None` as the default value. This could cause issues if `last_active` is supposed to be a valid timestamp.
2. The `time.time()` function is used to set the `started` attribute, but it is not clear if this is the intended behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `__init__` function is that the default value for `last_active` is set to `None`, which may not be appropriate if `last_active` is supposed to be a timestamp. Additionally, it's not clear if setting `self.started` to `time.time()` is the intended behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Provide a valid default value for `last_active` if it is supposed to be a timestamp.
2. Verify if setting `self.started` to `time.time()` is the intended behavior or if it should be initialized with a different value.

## Corrected version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=time.time()):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
In the corrected version:
1. The `last_active` parameter now defaults to the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided.
2. `self.started` remains set to `time.time()` unless a different initialization value is needed.
