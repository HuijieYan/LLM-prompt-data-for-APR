Based on the error message and the runtime values and types, it seems like the issue is with the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here's a corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `last_active` parameter is `None`. If it is, we set `self.last_active` to the current time using `time.time()`. Otherwise, we use the provided value for `last_active`.

This should correct the issue and pass the failing test.
