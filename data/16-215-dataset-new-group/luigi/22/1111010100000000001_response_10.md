## Analysis
The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This method initializes a `Worker` object with the provided `worker_id` and optional `last_active` parameter. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute.

## Error location
The potential error location is in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` attribute is assigned the value of the `last_active` parameter without any validation.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is being assigned directly to the `last_active` attribute without checking if it is a valid value. This may lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid value is provided, or if it is not provided at all.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is properly validated before assigning it to the `last_active` attribute. We can use a default value of `None` if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, and validate that it is a valid timestamp if it is provided.

## Corrected version
```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            try:
                self.last_active = float(last_active)  # seconds since epoch
            except ValueError:
                raise ValueError("last_active must be a valid timestamp")
        else:
            self.last_active = None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is a valid timestamp before assigning it to the `last_active` attribute. If the parameter is `None`, it is directly assigned to the attribute, otherwise, it is validated and then assigned.
