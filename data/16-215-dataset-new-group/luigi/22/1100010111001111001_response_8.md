The bug in the `__init__` function is that it does not correctly set the `last_active` parameter when it is provided. It should use the provided `last_active` parameter if it is not None, otherwise, it should default to the current time.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to correctly handle the `last_active` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected function, the failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should now pass as the `last_active` parameter is correctly handled.
