To fix the bug in the provided buggy function, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter defaults to a valid value when no input is provided. We can achieve this by using the `time.time()` function to get the current time when `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Explanation:
In the original buggy function, the `last_active` parameter was not handled properly when it was not provided. This resulted in a `NoneType` error when it was used in the `prune` method, as observed in the failing test. To fix this, we modified the logic to use the current time if `last_active` is not provided.

With the corrected function, the `last_active` parameter now defaults to the current time when not provided, preventing the `NoneType` error observed in the failing test. The function now satisfies the expected input/output values.
