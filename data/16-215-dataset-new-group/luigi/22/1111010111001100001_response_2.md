The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly when it is provided. This causes the `prune` method called in the failing test to produce unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to properly assign the `last_active` parameter when it is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the failing test should now pass.
