The bug in the `__init__` function of the Worker class is that it sets the last_active attribute to None if not provided, and then uses it directly without checking if it's None or not.

The cause of the bug is that the `__init__` function does not account for the case where `last_active` is not provided, and hence defaults to `None`. Later in the function, when `last_active` is used, it does not check if it's `None` or not, leading to a potential error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to check if `last_active` is provided or not. If it's not provided, we can set it to the current time using `time.time()`. Then we can use the `last_active` attribute safely without having to worry about it being None.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` function will set the `last_active` attribute to the current time if it's not provided, ensuring that it's never `None` when it's used later in the function. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
