## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# This is the corrected version of the function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

## Analysis
The bug in the original function is that it sets the initial value of `last_active` to `None` and always initializes `started` with the current time using `time.time()`. This means that if `last_active` is not provided as an argument, it will default to `None` and `started` will be set to the current time, which is not the expected behavior.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location is in how the default value for `last_active` is handled and how the `started` attribute is initialized.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute should default to the current time if it is not provided, but the original code initializes it with `None`, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by checking if `last_active` is `None` inside the `__init__` function, and if it is `None`, then set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

I have updated the function to handle the default value for `last_active` correctly, so it will default to the current time if it is not provided.
