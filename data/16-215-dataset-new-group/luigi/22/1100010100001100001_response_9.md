## The corrected version of the function

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

### Explanation
The issue with the original function is that it always sets the value of `self.last_active` to `time.time()` regardless of whether a value is provided as the input `last_active`. This essentially ignores the input value and always sets `last_active` to the current time.

To fix this, we can check if `last_active` is `None` and only set `self.last_active` to the current time if that is the case. Otherwise, we use the input value of `last_active`.

### Updated Strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the assignment of `self.last_active` to use the input value if it is not `None`, otherwise, set it to the current time.

The corrected version of the function includes a conditional assignment to achieve this.
