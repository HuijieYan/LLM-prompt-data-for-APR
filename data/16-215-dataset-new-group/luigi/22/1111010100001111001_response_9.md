## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The bug in the original function is that it assigns the value of `time.time()` to `self.started` unconditionally, even if `last_active` is provided. The corrected version of the function checks if `last_active` is `None`, and if it is, it assigns the current time using `time.time()`, otherwise, it assigns the value of `last_active` to `self.started`. This ensures that the correct value is assigned to `self.started` based on the input provided.

The corrected version of the function now satisfies the expected input/output values.
