To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, the default value should be set to the current time.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the default value of `time.time()` when `last_active` is not provided, we can ensure that the `last_active` parameter will always have a valid value and prevent the TypeError that was previously occurring.
