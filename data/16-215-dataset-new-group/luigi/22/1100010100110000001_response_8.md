The buggy function `__init__` is not initializing the `last_active` attribute properly, which is causing the TypeError when `prune` method is called. The error message indicates that the addition operation `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay` is failing because `self.last_active` is of type `None`, which is not supported in arithmetic operations.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function needs to handle the case when `last_active` is not provided and set it to the current time in seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time if it is not provided. This ensures that the addition operation in the `prune` method will not encounter a TypeError, and the failing test should pass with this fix.
