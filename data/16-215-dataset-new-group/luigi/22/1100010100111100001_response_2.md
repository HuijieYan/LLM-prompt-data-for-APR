The bug in the `__init__` function is causing a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called due to an unsupported operand type for the `+` operator. The error is occurring because the `last_active` variable is initialized as `None` and then used in an addition operation with an integer value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is given a default value if not provided, ensuring it is always a valid number when used in operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By providing a default value of `time.time()` for `last_active` if it's not provided, we ensure that it always contains a valid number, preventing the `TypeError` when used in operations.
