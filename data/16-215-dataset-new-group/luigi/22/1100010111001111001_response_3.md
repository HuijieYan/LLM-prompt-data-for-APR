The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly handled. The `last_active` parameter is being assigned a default value of `None`, but it should be using the value provided as the input.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `last_active` assignment to handle the default value correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will now be handled correctly, using the provided value if it is not `None`, and defaulting to the current time using `time.time()` if no value is provided.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
