The bug in the given function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being utilized correctly. It is intended to be set to the value passed in as `last_active`, but the default value of `None` is being assigned instead.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the `last_active` parameter and use its value when provided. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we added a condition to check if the `last_active` parameter is not `None`. If it's not `None`, then we set the `self.last_active` attribute to the value of `last_active`. If it is `None`, then we use the current time as the default value for `self.last_active`.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `last_active` parameter is correctly used to initialize the `self.last_active` attribute when provided.
