The buggy function `__init__` in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is not initializing the variable `last_active` properly, causing it to be set to `None`. This causes an error when the `prune` method is called in the failing test, as it attempts to perform an operation with `None` and an integer.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should check if `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if it is, or set it to the provided value if it's not `None`. This will ensure that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid numeric value.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` variable will always be initialized to a valid value, and the failing test should pass without the TypeError.
