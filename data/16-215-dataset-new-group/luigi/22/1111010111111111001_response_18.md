The bug in the buggy function is that the `last_active` variable is being set to `None` by default, resulting in a `NoneType` and 'int' addition error when `worker.prune` is called.

To fix this, we need to check if `last_active` is None and handle it accordingly to avoid the error.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` variable is set to the current time if it is None, avoiding the TypeError when `worker.prune` is called.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
