The bug in the `Worker` class is found in the `prune` method. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `self.last_active` with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. The specific error message is "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'", which means that `self.last_active` is `None` and it cannot be used in an addition operation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is always initialized with a valid value.

Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune worker
            pass  # replace with actual pruning logic
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `last_active` in the constructor to ensure that it is initialized with a valid value if `None` is provided. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when `prune` is called.
