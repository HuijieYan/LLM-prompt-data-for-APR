The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is not provided and set to None. This causes a TypeError when trying to perform arithmetic operations on a NoneType and an integer.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` function to handle the case when `last_active` is None. We can set it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # This is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is checked for None, and the current time is used as a fallback. This will prevent the TypeError when trying to perform arithmetic operations on the `last_active` variable.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
