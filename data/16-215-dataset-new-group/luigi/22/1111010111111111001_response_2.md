The bug in the buggy function occurs because the `last_active` parameter is allowed to be `None`, but this causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic with it.

To fix the bug, we can modify the initialization of `last_active` in the `__init__` method to default to the current time if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` and is initialized to the current time if it is not provided. This ensures that there are no `None` values used in arithmetic operations, and the test should pass with the corrected function.
