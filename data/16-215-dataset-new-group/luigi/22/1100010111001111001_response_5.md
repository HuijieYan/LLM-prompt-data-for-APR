The bug in the `__init__` function is that it sets `self.started` to the current time using `time.time()` every time a new Worker object is initialized. This causes the value of `self.started` to be different every time a new Worker object is created, which is not expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should only initialize `self.started` when `last_active` is not provided, and set it to `time.time()` only in that case. If `last_active` is provided, we should leave `self.started` unchanged.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    if last_active is None:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.started = last_active
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
