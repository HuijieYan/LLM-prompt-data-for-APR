The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method.

To fix the bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be correctly assigned to `self.last_active` if it is provided, and otherwise, the current time will be used as the default value.
