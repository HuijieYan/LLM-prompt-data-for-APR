The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is caused by the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None` and then later used in an arithmetic operation.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is `None`, and if it is, initialize it to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` is initialized to `time.time()` only if it was not provided as an argument, and the bug causing the `TypeError` is fixed.
