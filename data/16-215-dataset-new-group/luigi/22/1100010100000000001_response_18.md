## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `__init__` constructor for a class that initializes worker attributes. The potential error locations may be the initialization of the `self.started` attribute and the `self.last_active` attribute.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the code is that the `self.started` attribute is being initialized with the current time using `time.time()`, but the `self.last_active` attribute is being initialized with the value passed in or `None`. This means that the `self.last_active` attribute may not be in sync with the actual time when the worker was last active.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should initialize both `self.started` and `self.last_active` attributes using the current time.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
