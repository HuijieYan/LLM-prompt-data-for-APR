The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class has an issue with the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default and then being referenced without being properly handled. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and `int` together in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, the `last_active` parameter should be handled properly in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By adding a conditional check for `last_active` being `None`, the corrected version ensures that the `last_active` attribute is assigned the current timestamp when no value is provided.

With this correction, the `prune` method will be able to handle the `last_active` attribute correctly, and the failing test should pass.
