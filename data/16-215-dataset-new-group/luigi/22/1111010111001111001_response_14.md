To fix the issue in the buggy function, we need to correct the initialization of the `self.started` variable. It is currently being set to the current time using `time.time()`, which is causing the failing test. Instead, we should use the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, or the current time if it is not.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        if last_active is not None:
            self.started = last_active  # use last_active if provided
        else:
            self.started = time.time()  # use current time if last_active is not provided
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `started` variable is set to `last_active` if it is provided, and to the current time if it is not. This ensures that the expected values are met and the failing test will pass.
