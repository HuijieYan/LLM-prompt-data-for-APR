The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is set to default to `None`, and then later the code tries to perform addition with it, resulting in a `TypeError`. 

To fix this bug, the default value of `last_active` needs to be set to an appropriate value or the addition operation should be handled differently to avoid the `NoneType` error.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Do something
```

With this fix, the code should now pass the failing test case and behave as expected.
