The bug in the given code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned in the `__init__` function. 

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized correctly, and it is using the default value of `None` instead of the specified value. This causes the `last_active` variable to not be set to the correct value passed in.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be properly assigned in the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned in the `__init__` function, and the code should pass the failing test.
