The problematic code is initializing the `self.started` attribute with `time.time()` directly in the `__init__` method. This leads to different values at different times and causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should calculate the `self.started` attribute outside the `__init__` method and just assign it in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
