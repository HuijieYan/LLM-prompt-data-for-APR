The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file. The bug is causing the `prune` method in the test file `test/scheduler_test.py` to fail.

The bug is likely in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, as it is responsible for initializing the class attributes. The `prune` method in the failing test scenario is likely expecting certain attributes to be initialized correctly, and the bug is causing those expectations to not be met.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. It is being set to the value passed as an argument, but it should default to `None` if no value is provided.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class should be updated to correctly handle the default value for `last_active` when it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this corrected version, the `last_active` attribute will default to the current time if no value is provided, which should resolve the failure of the `prune` method in the failing test scenario.
