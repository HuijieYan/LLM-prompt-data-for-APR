To fix the bug, we need to initialize the last_active parameter correctly and set it to the value passed in the constructor. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By initializing the last_active parameter correctly in the constructor, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
