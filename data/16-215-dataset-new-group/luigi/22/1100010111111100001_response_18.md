The bug in the `__init__` function is caused because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None`, and in the `prune` method, it is used in an expression to calculate the time of worker disconnect. This results in a `TypeError` because we are trying to perform addition with a `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this bug, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` function that is not `None`. We can use the time of worker initialization as the default value.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will default to the time of worker initialization if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
