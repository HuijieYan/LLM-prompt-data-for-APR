## The corrected version of the function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

## Analyzing the buggy function
The function seems to be an initialization function for a class. It takes a worker_id and an optional last_active parameter.

## Potential error locations
- The line `self.started = time.time()` is setting the 'started' attribute without considering the 'last_active' parameter. This could potentially overwrite a valid 'last_active' input.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug is that the 'started' attribute is always set to the current time using `time.time()`, regardless of whether the 'last_active' parameter is provided or not. This could lead to incorrect initialization of the 'started' attribute.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
We should conditionally set the 'started' attribute to the current time only if the 'last_active' parameter is not provided. Otherwise, we should use the provided 'last_active' parameter.

## The corrected version of the function
I have added a conditional check to set the 'started' attribute based on the 'last_active' parameter.

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
