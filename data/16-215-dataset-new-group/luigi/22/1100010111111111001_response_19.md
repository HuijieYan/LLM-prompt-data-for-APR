The buggy function fails to initialize the last_active attribute properly. The error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'" indicates that the last_active attribute is of type None instead of a float, causing the program to throw an error when trying to perform addition with it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the last_active attribute is initialized properly with the correct type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
