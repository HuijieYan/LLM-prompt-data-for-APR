The issue with the provided buggy function is that it allows the `last_active` parameter to be initialized as `None`, and later the code tries to perform addition using this `None` value. This results in the `TypeError` of unsupported operand types when the function `prune` is called.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function should be updated to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided by setting a default value of `0` instead of `None`. This will ensure that the addition operation in the `prune` function does not encounter a `None` type.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Set default value for last_active
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is initialized to `0` by default, which ensures that the addition operation in the `prune` function can be performed without encountering a `None` type.

The corrected version of the `__init__` function should now pass the failing test without raising a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.
