The issue with the buggy function is that it sets the `self.started` variable to the current time using `time.time()` at the time of object creation, rather than using the `last_active` parameter if it is provided.

To fix the bug, the `self.started` variable should be set to `last_active` if it is not None, otherwise it should be set to the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function will use the `last_active` parameter if it is provided, otherwise it will use the current time. This will ensure that the `self.started` variable is set correctly according to the expected behavior.
