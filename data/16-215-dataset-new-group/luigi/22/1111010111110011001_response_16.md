The issue in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, but in the `prune` method it is being used in an arithmetic operation without being checked for `None`.

To fix this issue, the `prune` method should first check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before using it in an operation.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform prune operation
            pass
```

With this correction, the `prune` method now first checks if `self.last_active` is not `None` before using it in the arithmetic operation, avoiding the `NoneType` error.
