The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to the input value, and the `started` attribute is being set to the current time rather than the input `last_active`. Additionally, there is no `prune` method in the provided code, so the test case is not applicable and will need to be updated after the bug is fixed.

To fix the bug:
- Use the `last_active` parameter to set the `last_active` attribute.
- Use the current time only if `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now, the `last_active` parameter is properly used to set the `last_active` attribute, and the `started` attribute is set to the current time only if `last_active` is not provided. This corrected version of the `__init__` method should pass the failing test.
