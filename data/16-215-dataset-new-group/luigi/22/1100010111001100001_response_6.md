The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. It takes in the worker_id and last_active as input parameters and initializes various attributes of the Worker object.

The failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` creates a Worker object with worker_id 123 and then calls the `prune` method on it, passing a temporary configuration object as a parameter.

The bug in the `__init__` method is that it initializes the `self.started` attribute with the current time using `time.time()` every time a new Worker object is created. This causes the `self.started` attribute to have a different value for every new Worker object, regardless of the `last_active` parameter.

The goal of the `__init__` method is to initialize `self.started` with the value of `last_active` if it is provided, or with the current time using `time.time()` if `last_active` is not provided.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to check if the `last_active` parameter is provided. If it is provided, then initialize `self.started` with the value of `last_active`, otherwise initialize it with the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method will now correctly initialize the `self.started` attribute based on the `last_active` parameter, and the failing test should pass.
