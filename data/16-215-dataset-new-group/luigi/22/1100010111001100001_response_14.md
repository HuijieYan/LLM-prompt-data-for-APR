The bug in the code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method. This is causing the `last_active` value to be lost and not stored in the `Worker` object.

To fix this bug, we need to assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
```

With this correction, the failing test `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass.
