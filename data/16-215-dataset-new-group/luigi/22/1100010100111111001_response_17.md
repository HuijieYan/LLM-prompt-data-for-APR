The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to a time value in the `prune` method.

To fix this, the `last_active` parameter should default to `time.time()` if no value is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
