The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being passed as `None` when the `Worker` class is initialized. Later, when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to `None` not being a valid operand for the addition operation.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` when initializing the `Worker` class and provide a default value.

Here's the corrected version of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()` construct, we provide a default value for `last_active` if it is `None`, ensuring that it's always a valid value for the subsequent operations in the `prune` method.

With this correction, the `Worker` class should now pass the failing test case and produce the expected output values.
