The bug in the `__init__` function is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default, which results in a `TypeError` when an arithmetic operation is attempted on it. To fix the bug, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` that can be used in the arithmetic operation.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use the current time in seconds since epoch as the default value for `last_active` if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time in seconds since epoch if it is not provided, preventing the `TypeError` that occurs when performing arithmetic operations on `NoneType`. This should resolve the issue and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
