The issue in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class is that the `self.started` variable is being initialized using `time.time()` directly, which is causing a change in value between the runtime and expected cases.

To fix this issue, we can initialize the `self.started` variable using the provided `last_active` parameter if it is not None, otherwise, use the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.started = last_active
        else:
            self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `self.started` variable will always be initialized correctly, and the test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` should pass with the expected variable values.
