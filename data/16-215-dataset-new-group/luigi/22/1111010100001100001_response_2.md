The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being correctly assigned to the `last_active` class variable within the `__init__` constructor.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being used to update the `last_active` class variable. Instead, the `started` variable is being assigned the current time using `time.time()`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `last_active` class variable with the value of the `last_active` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` class variable will be updated with the value of the `last_active` parameter if it's provided, or it will be initialized with the current time if the `last_active` parameter is `None`.
