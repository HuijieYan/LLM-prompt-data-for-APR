The buggy function is the `__init__` method inside the `Worker` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the prune time based on the `last_active` and the `worker_disconnect_delay`. The bug is caused by the `last_active` variable being initialized as `None`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are when trying to add `last_active` and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` without checking if `last_active` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` within the `__init__` method. We should set a default value to `last_active` in case it is not provided during the initialization.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method with a default value for `last_active`:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` is set to the current time if it is not provided, which prevents the `TypeError` when comparing it with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` during the `prune` operation.
