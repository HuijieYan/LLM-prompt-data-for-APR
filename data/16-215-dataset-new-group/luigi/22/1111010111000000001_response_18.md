The issue with the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class is that it's trying to initialize the `self.started` attribute with `time.time()` every time a new `Worker` object is created. This means that `self.started` will always have the same value for all `Worker` objects created within the same second, which leads to incorrect tracking of the start time for each worker.

To fix this, we need to initialize `self.started` only when `last_active` is not provided, and if it is provided, then calculate the `self.started` attribute based on the difference between `last_active` and the current time.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
import time

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # the corrected __init__ function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        if last_active is not None:
            self.started = time.time() - (time.time() - last_active)  # calculate started based on last_active
        else:
            self.started = time.time()  # initialize started with current time
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

This corrected version calculates the `self.started` attribute based on whether `last_active` is provided or not, ensuring that it accurately reflects the start time of the worker. This version should pass the failing test.
