The bug in the `__init__` function is not evident from the given input/output values. The function seems to be initializing the instance variables correctly based on the input parameters. However, there could be potential issues with the `time.time()` function and the initialization of the `last_active` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if no value is provided. Additionally, we need to handle any potential exceptions that may occur when initializing the `started` variable with the current time using `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch

    try:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error initializing started variable: {e}")
    
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the `last_active` parameter is provided and use the current time if not. We also handle any potential exceptions that may occur when initializing the `started` variable using `time.time()`.
