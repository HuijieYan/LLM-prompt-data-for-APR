The issue with the `__init__` function seems to be related to the `last_active` parameter. When the `prune` method is called in the test function, it seems to expect the `last_active` parameter to be set to a certain value, but the `__init__` function does not ensure that. The potential error locations are in the way `last_active` is handled and updated within the `__init__` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter is not being set to a specific value when the `__init__` function is called, causing the `prune` method in the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we should update the `__init__` function to take care of setting the `last_active` parameter to a default value if it is not provided. We can accomplish this by using the `if` statement to set `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that the `prune` method will have the expected behavior.

The corrected version of the `__init__` function should pass the failing test.
