The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where `last_active` is `None` when initializing the `Worker` object. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `last_active` and `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

To fix this, we need to provide a default value for `last_active` if it is not specified. We can use the current time as the default value in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This will ensure that `last_active` defaults to the current time if it is not provided, and the arithmetic operations in the `prune` method will work as expected.
