The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is passed as `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called, as it tries to add `None` to an integer value.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version checks if `last_active` is `None` and if so, assigns the current time using `time.time()` to `self.last_active`. This prevents the `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called with a `None` `last_active` value.
