The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` in the `__init__` function, which is causing a `TypeError` when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to check if `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time using `time.time()` if it is. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute always has a valid value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when attempting to add the disconnect delay to `None`.
