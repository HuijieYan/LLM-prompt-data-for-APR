The issue in the buggy code is that the `prune` method is being called on the `Worker` object without being defined in the `Worker` class. Additionally, the `last_active` and `started` attributes are not being updated when calling the `prune` method.

Here's the fixed code for the `Worker` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        current_time = time.time()
        if (current_time - self.last_active) > config.worker_disconnect_delay:
            self.reference = None
            self.tasks = set()
            self.info = {}
```

Explanation:
1. We added a new method `prune` to the `Worker` class to handle the pruning logic.
2. In the `__init__` method, we updated the `last_active` attribute to use the provided value if not `None`, otherwise, set it to the current time.
3. Inside the `prune` method, we calculate the difference between the current time and the `last_active` time, and if it exceeds the `worker_disconnect_delay`, we reset the `reference`, `tasks`, and `info` attributes.

Now the `Worker` class has the required `prune` method, and the provided test should pass with this corrected code.
