The bug in the given function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being assigned correctly to the `last_active` attribute. Instead, it is directly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute without converting it to seconds since the epoch.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is converted to seconds since the epoch before assigning it to the `self.last_active` attribute. We can use the `time.time()` function to achieve this.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = time.time() if last_active is None else last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
