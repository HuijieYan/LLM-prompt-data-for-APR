The bug in the provided code is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class.

The `last_active` parameter is not being used to assign `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method. Instead, a default value of `None` is being assigned to `self.last_active`, and `self.started` is being assigned to the current time.

To fix this bug, we need to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to `self.last_active`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
