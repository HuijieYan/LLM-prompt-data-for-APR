The bug in the `__init__` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `last_active` parameter is not provided. This causes `self.last_active` to be initialized as `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` when attempting to perform addition with an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we can provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This corrected version includes a check for `last_active` being `None` and sets it to the current time using `time.time()` when that's the case. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue encountered in the failing test.
