```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            print("Pruning worker:", self.id)
            # More actions to prune the worker        
```

Explanation:
- The bug in the original function is that it doesn't handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is None, which leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add it to the current time.
- I added a check to see if `last_active` is None and set `self.last_active` accordingly to fix the bug. This will ensure that the addition operation doesn't raise a `TypeError`.
- I also modified the `prune` method slightly to include a placeholder print statement to demonstrate that the function can now be successfully called without raising an error.

The corrected version of the function satisfies the expected input/output values and should pass the failing test.
