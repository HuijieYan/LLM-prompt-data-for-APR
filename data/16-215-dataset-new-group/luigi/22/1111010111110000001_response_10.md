The bug in the provided code is located in the `init` method of the `Worker` class. The `last_active` parameter is set to default to `None`, and later in the `prune` method, there is an attempt to perform addition with `None` and an integer value. This results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should have a default value that can be added to an integer without causing a `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

The correction involves explicitly checking if `last_active` is `None` in the `__init__` method. If it is `None`, the current timestamp is used as the default value. This ensures that the `last_active` attribute always contains a valid timestamp that can be added to an integer without causing a `TypeError`.
