The bug in the `__init__` function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to a timestamp in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is set to a default value if it is not provided. We can use the current time as the default value.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` in the `prune` method.
