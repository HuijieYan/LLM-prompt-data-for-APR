The bug in the given function is that it assigns the current time to the `self.started` variable instead of the value of `last_active` if it's not `None`. This causes the `self.started` value to be different from the `last_active` value when it should be the same in cases where `last_active` is provided.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the `last_active` parameter is not `None` and if so, assign its value to `self.started`. Otherwise, we can leave it as it is.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This modification ensures that if `last_active` is provided, its value is assigned to both `self.last_active` and `self.started`, and if it's not provided, `self.started` is assigned the current time.
