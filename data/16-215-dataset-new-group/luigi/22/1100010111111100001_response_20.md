The bug in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is that the `last_active` parameter is not initialized properly. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called, as it tries to add `None` to an integer.

To fix this bug, the `last_active` parameter should default to `None` in the `__init__` function, and then be updated with the current time when the worker becomes active.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter is properly initialized to the current time when it is not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called.

This corrected version of the function will pass the failing test.
