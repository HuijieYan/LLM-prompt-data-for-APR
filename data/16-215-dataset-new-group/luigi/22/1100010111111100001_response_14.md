The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case when the `last_active` parameter is not provided (it defaults to `None`). This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add `None` and an `int` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

To fix this, we can modify the `prune` method to handle the case when `self.last_active` is `None`. We can check if `self.last_active` is not `None` before performing the comparison with `time.time()`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # Perform worker pruning logic
```

With this modification, the `prune` method will only perform the comparison if `self.last_active` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
