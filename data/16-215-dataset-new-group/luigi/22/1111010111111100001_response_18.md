The bug in the code is caused by the `last_active` parameter being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and then being used in the `prune` method without checking for its value.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check in the `prune` method to handle the case when `last_active` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `self.last_active is not None` before performing the comparison in the `prune` method.

This fix should address the bug and allow the test `test_worker_prune_after_init` to pass without raising a `TypeError`.
