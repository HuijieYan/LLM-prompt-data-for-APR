The buggy function is the __init__ constructor for a class, taking in parameters worker_id and last_active and initializing various attributes of the class instance.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The last_active parameter is set to None by default, which may cause issues later on if it's not properly handled.
2. The started attribute is initialized with time.time() without handling any potential exceptions or errors from the time module.

The cause of the bug is that the last_active parameter might not be handled properly if it is left as None, and there is potential for issues with the time module if the time.time() function throws an exception.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the default value for last_active in a more robust way, and to add error handling for the time.time() call.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0  # default to 0 if last_active is None
    try:
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error initializing started attribute: {e}")
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for last_active being None and defaulting it to 0 if it is. We have also added a try-except block to handle any potential exceptions from the time.time() call.
