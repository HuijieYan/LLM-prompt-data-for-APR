The cause of the bug is that the `last_active` variable is initialized as `None` and then used in the `prune` method, causing a `TypeError` when it is used in a comparison with an integer.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` variable should be initialized to the current time if it is not provided as an argument when initializing the `Worker` object.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` variable will default to the current time if not provided, and the TypeError should be resolved.
