From the error message and the runtime values, it seems that the `last_active` variable is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize `last_active` to the provided value or to the current time if no value is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` variable is initialized to either the provided value or the current time if no value is provided. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue when calling the `prune` method.
