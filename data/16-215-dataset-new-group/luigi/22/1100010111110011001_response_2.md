The issue in the given buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by assigning a default value of 0 to it.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter will default to 0 if it is not provided, avoiding the `NoneType` and `int` addition error in the `prune` method.
