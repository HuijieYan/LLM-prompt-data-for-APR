The buggy function `__init__` initializes the Worker object with an optional `last_active` parameter. The issue arises when the `last_active` parameter is not provided and is set to `None`. The bug is triggered when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object and attempts to calculate `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to `NoneType` and `int` being used in the addition operation.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided, and default it to the current time when initializing the Worker.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
With this change, if `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time. This ensures that the `prune` method can safely perform arithmetic operations on `self.last_active` without encountering a `NoneType` error.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
