The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where the `last_active` parameter is not provided, causing it to default to `None`. This is why the error message states "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'".

To fix the bug, we need to check whether `last_active` is None and handle the default case.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter now defaults to the current time if it's not provided, avoiding the "NoneType" error in the failing test.
