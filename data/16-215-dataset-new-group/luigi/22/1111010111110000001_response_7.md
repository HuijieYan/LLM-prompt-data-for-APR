The buggy function `__init__` in the `Worker` class initializes the `last_active` attribute with a default value of `None`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to the `worker_disconnect_delay` from the `TmpCfg` class in the failing test. This is because you cannot perform addition operations on a `NoneType` and an `int`.

To fix this bug, you can initialize the `last_active` attribute with a default value using the current time if no value is provided. This can be done using an if-else statement in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function in the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch

        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time if no value is provided, preventing the `TypeError` when trying to add it to the `worker_disconnect_delay`.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass without any `TypeError`.
