The bug in the given function is that the assignment of the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` variable is not handled properly, leading to potential runtime errors and unexpected behavior.

The `last_active` parameter is being assigned directly to the `self.last_active` variable without any validation or conversion, which could lead to issues if the input type is not as expected. Additionally, the `last_active` parameter is being assigned a default value of `None`, which could also cause issues when used as a floating point number.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is a valid floating point number before assigning it to `self.last_active`. We should also handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value of 0.0 in that case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None and isinstance(last_active, (int, float)):
        self.last_active = float(last_active)  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = 0.0  # default value
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With these changes, we validate the `last_active` parameter to ensure it is a valid floating point number before assignment, and provide a default value of 0.0 if `last_active` is `None`.

This should resolve the issue and prevent potential runtime errors related to the handling of the `last_active` parameter.
