The code is trying to add the last active time of the worker to the worker disconnect delay from the configuration, but it's getting a TypeError because the last_active is set to None by default, which cannot be added to an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to check if last_active is None and handle it accordingly. We can set last_active to the current time if it's None.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
