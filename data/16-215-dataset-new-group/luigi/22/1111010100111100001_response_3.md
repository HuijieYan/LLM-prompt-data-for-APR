The bug is caused by the `last_active` parameter being set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This is resulting in a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called and tries to use `self.last_active` as a numeric value.

To fix this bug, we should set a default value for `last_active` that can be used in the comparison in the `prune` method. We can use `time.time()` as the default value for `last_active`, which represents the current time in seconds since the epoch.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:  # Set last_active to the current time if it is not provided
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the default value of `last_active` is set to the current time when not provided, and it can be safely compared with other numeric values in the `prune` method.
