The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, causing a `TypeError` when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method. 

The fix for this bug is to check if `last_active` has been provided and only attempt to add it to the `config.worker_disconnect_delay` if it is not `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

def prune(self, config):
    # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
    if self.last_active and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
        # prune the worker
```

With this change, the function now checks if `self.last_active` is not `None` before adding it to the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, which should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
