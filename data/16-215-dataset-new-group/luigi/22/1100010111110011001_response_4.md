The issue with the buggy function `__init__` is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default and this causes an error when trying to add it to an integer value in the `prune` method. 

To fix this bug, we can initialize `last_active` to the current time if it is not provided as an argument when instantiating the `Worker` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected and pass the failing test.
