## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `NoneType` and `int` together.

## Identifying the Bug
The bug lies in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class where the `last_active` parameter is not being initialized properly.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused because the `last_active` parameter is being set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it tries to add `None` to `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by initializing `self.last_active` to the current time when it is not provided, which will ensure it always contains a valid value.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
