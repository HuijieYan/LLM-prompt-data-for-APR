The buggy function is the __init__ method within the Worker class. The purpose of this method is to initialize instances of the Worker class with the given worker_id and last_active time. The bug seems to be related to the default argument for last_active which is set to None.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The default argument last_active=None may cause an issue if the last_active attribute is not properly assigned when an instance of the Worker class is created.
2. It's unclear how the last_active attribute should be utilized in the context of this class and its instances, as there are no checks or logic to handle the case where last_active is None.

The cause of the bug is that the last_active attribute is not being properly handled and initialized within the __init__ method of the Worker class. This could lead to unexpected behavior when working with instances of the Worker class.

To fix the bug, we could modify the __init__ method to handle the case where last_active is not provided or is set to None. We could also provide clear instructions in the class documentation on how to use the last_active attribute.

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected version, we have added a conditional to check if last_active is not None. If it is not None, we assign it to self.last_active. Otherwise, we use the current time as the default value. This should prevent unexpected behavior and handle the case where last_active is not provided correctly.
