## Explanation
The buggy function has issues with handling sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples when received as form data. The function does not handle sequence types properly, resulting in errors and incorrect data processing.

The function incorrectly processes the received data for sequence shapes, leading to errors in the validation process. Additionally, the handling of file uploads within sequences is not correct.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle sequence shapes and ensure that the validation process works as expected.

The correction includes handling sequence shapes, files within sequences, and the validation of sequence data. The corrected function now correctly processes the received data for sequence types and performs the validation process appropriately. With these changes, the function resolves the issues observed in the failing test cases.

By making these corrections, the buggy function now correctly processes sequences received as form data and handles the validation process accordingly, ensuring that the tests pass as expected.
