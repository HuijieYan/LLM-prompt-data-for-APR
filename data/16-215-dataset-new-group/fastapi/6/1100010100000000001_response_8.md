The potential error locations in the buggy function include the improper handling of required parameters and the possibility of incorrect validation checks on the received body.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the required parameters and received body data correctly, resulting in potential issues with validation and error handling.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the required parameters and received body data, ensuring that the validation and error handling process is accurate and error-free.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.name in received_body:
                    value = received_body[field.name]
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.name)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.name))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through the required parameters and validates the received body data against these parameters. It checks for the presence of the required fields and handles the validation and error handling process appropriately.
