To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to address the issue of handling repeated key-value pairs in form data. The function currently does not handle this scenario properly, leading to failing tests and the GitHub issue discussing the problem.

The cause of the bug is that when receiving form data with repeated keys, the function only considers the last key-value pair, leading to incorrect values being assigned to the fields. This causes the failing tests and does not align with the expectations of users, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data and ensure that all values are captured and processed appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if not value:  # Handle missing values
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the `required_params` and handle the form data values for each field correctly. If a field has multiple values due to repeated key-value pairs, we use `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` to obtain all the values for that key and process them accordingly.

This correction addresses the issue raised in the failing tests and aligns with the expectations in the GitHub issue regarding the handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data.
