Looking at the buggy function, it seems the issue arises when handling non-typing sequences (sets, lists, tuples) in the received body. The function is meant to convert the received body into arguments, but it is not handling non-typing sequences in the `request_body_to_args` function correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the values of non-typing sequences such as set, list, and tuple are not properly handled and converted into the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling non-typing sequences in the `request_body_to_args` function. Specifically, we should update the logic for checking the shape of the field and the received body, and then process the values accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple))
            ):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                else:
                    value = await asyncio.gather(*value)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected function, the non-typing sequences in the received body should be handled correctly, allowing the tests to pass.
