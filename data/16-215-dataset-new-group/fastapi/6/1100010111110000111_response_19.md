The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is meant to process the received body and return the values and errors. However, the current implementation seems to have a bug that causes it to return a 422 status code instead of the expected 200 status code. This is evident from the failing test cases for `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the processing of form data from the request where the received key-value pairs are not being handled as expected. This leads to an error in the processing and validation of the data, ultimately resulting in the incorrect status code being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle the processing of form data and ensure that the values are validated and returned as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (
                    isinstance(field.info, paraminfo.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the `required_params` and fetches the values from the `received_body` based on whether it is an instance of `FormData`. It then performs the necessary validations and returns the values and errors.

The corrected version of the function should address the issue and ensure that the tests pass with the expected status codes.
