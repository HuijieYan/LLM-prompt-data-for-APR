To fix this bug, we need to update the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated key=value pairs in form data, as the current implementation does not support this feature. This is in line with the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data".

The potential error locations in the buggy function are related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data, as well as the behavior of the `required_params` list and the `value` assignment.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly, leading to only the last key=value pair being considered.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the function handling the assignment of values from form data, the creation of error wrappers, and the handling of repeated keys.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                    values[field.name] = value
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
    return values, errors
```

By updating the function to handle repeated keys correctly and assigning the correct values to the `values` dictionary, we can now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
