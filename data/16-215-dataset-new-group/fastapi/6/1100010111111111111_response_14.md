The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing it to fail when receiving repeated keys in form data, such as a list, set, or tuple. This issue is related to a GitHub feature request that suggests modifying FastAPI to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

The bug in the function appears to be related to the handling of repeated keys. It fails to correctly handle the values for repeated keys in form data. The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly extract the values for repeated keys and convert them into the expected data types for the required parameters.

To fix this bug and align with the expected behavior, we need to modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in form data. We can achieve this by identifying the sequence of repeated keys in the data and converting them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        # Group the values for repeated keys
        values_grouped = {}
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            if key in values_grouped:
                if isinstance(values_grouped[key], list):
                    values_grouped[key].append(value)
                else:
                    values_grouped[key] = [values_grouped[key], value]
            else:
                values_grouped[key] = value
        
        # Process the grouped values
        for field in required_params:
            value = values_grouped.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

With this fix, the function now properly groups the values for repeated keys in form data and processes them in a way that aligns with the expected behavior. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values. Additionally, it also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub feature request effectively.
