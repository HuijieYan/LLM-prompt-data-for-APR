Based on the given runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not handling repeated keys in the `FormData` correctly when validating the input. The function fails to capture all repeated keys, leading to validation errors, especially when the expected type is a `list`, `set`, or `tuple`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in the `FormData` and assign those values as a `list`, `set`, or `tuple` before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                # Check if the field is a sequence type
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if isinstance(received_body[field.alias], list):
                        values[field.name] = received_body[field.alias]
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = [received_body[field.alias]]
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body[field.alias]
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```
In the corrected function:
- We iterate through the `required_params` and check if each field is present in the `received_body`.
- If the field is a sequence type (e.g., list, set, tuple), we check if the value in `received_body` is a list. If not, we convert it to a list with a single item.
- We assign the values to the `values` dictionary and handle missing required fields by adding errors to the `errors` list.

With these changes, the corrected function should handle repeated keys in the `FormData` correctly and avoid validation errors.

This fix addresses the issue on GitHub by ensuring that FastAPI collects repeated keys in the `FormData` and assigns those values as a `list`, `set`, or `tuple` to the same key before validation happens.

Please note that the corrected function assumes the availability of the `sequence_shapes` variable, which should be defined with appropriate sequence types (e.g., list, set, tuple) if it's not imported from elsewhere in the environment.
