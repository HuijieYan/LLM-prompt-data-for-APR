The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert data received from a request body into arguments that can be used for validation. However, the function is failing to handle repeated keys in form data correctly, leading to the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the validation of repeated keys and the handling of form data. It seems that the function is not properly handling repeated keys when parsing the form data and is only extracting the last value for a given key.

The cause of the bug is related to the issue reported in GitHub, where FastAPI does not support repeated key=value pairs in form data. This limitation prevents the function from correctly parsing and validating repeated keys, causing the failing tests for lists, sets, and tuples in the form data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle repeated keys in the form data and collect them as a list before validation. This will align with the GitHub issue and resolve the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == '':
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `getlist` method is used to handle repeated keys in form data. If the `received_body` is of type `FormData`, the function will call `getlist` to extract all values for a given key as a list. This modification aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle repeated keys in form data and pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
