The main issue in the buggy function is that the received_body parameter should not be altered until all errors have been identified and handled. The function is prematurely trying to restructure the received_body, leading to errors in the validation process.

To fix this bug, we need to attain all the validation errors and only then process the received_body based on the required_params.

Additionally, there are some issues in constructing the ErrorWrapper objects and extracting the correct values from the received_body to be used during the validation process for each field.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (str, bytes))
                and value == ""
            )
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (str, bytes))
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should ensure that the received_body parameter is only processed after all errors have been determined and handled. Additionally, it addresses the issues with constructing ErrorWrapper objects and extracting the correct values for validation.
