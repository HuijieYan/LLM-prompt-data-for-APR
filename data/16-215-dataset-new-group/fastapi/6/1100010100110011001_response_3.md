The cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs when the function `request_body_to_args` receives a required parameter in the request body, but the received body data is not processed correctly. This leads to the function returning a status code of 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200 (OK) for the test cases provided.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- There are several issues present in the function. First, the code does not properly handle the situation where the received_body is a list or a set. Second, there are issues with the object types not being handled correctly. We will need to modify the function to handle these cases properly and ensure that the correct status code is returned.

The fixed code is as follows:
```python
from typing import Tuple, Dict, Any, List
from fastapi import params
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.errors import MissingError

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.alias] = value
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
