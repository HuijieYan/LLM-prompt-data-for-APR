The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has a couple of potential errors that could be causing the failing tests. The function is responsible for converting received request body data into a dictionary of values and a list of errors, using the required parameters and the received body.

After analyzing the failing tests and the function, it seems that the error may be related to the handling of nested sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the request body data. The function tries to handle various types of parameters and their shapes, but it may have errors in handling them correctly.

The failing tests expect a status code of 200, but instead, they are receiving a status code of 422, indicating that the request body data is not being processed correctly and is resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle nested sequences and their processing in the received body data. It should also ensure that the values and errors are being calculated and returned correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in (1, 2) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have removed unnecessary conditions and simplified the logic for extracting the value from the received body. We also correctly handle validating the field value and adding errors as needed.

This corrected version should fix the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass with the expected status code of 200.
