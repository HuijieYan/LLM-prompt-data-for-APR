Error Analysis:
The error is caused by the `request_body_to_args` function that fails to correctly handle list-like sequences such as Python list, set, and tuple when passed as form data. This leads to an incorrect status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly validate and convert the list-like sequence data passed as form data.

Bug Cause:
The function `request_body_to_args` does not appropriately handle list-like sequences when received as form data. It incorrectly processes the data and fails to convert it into the expected format, leading to a validation error.

Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately handle list-like sequences when passed as form data. It should properly validate and convert the data into the expected format. In this case, we should ensure that the list-like sequences are correctly processed and converted into the appropriate data types to avoid validation errors.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, I removed the unnecessary condition for single fields, removed the condition for empty strings, and simplified the handling of form data. This will ensure that list-like sequences are correctly processed and converted into the expected format, resolving the validation errors. Now, the corrected function should pass the failing tests with the expected 200 status code.
