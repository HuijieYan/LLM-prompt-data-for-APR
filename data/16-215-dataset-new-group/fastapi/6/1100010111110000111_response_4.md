First, let's analyze the buggy function and the failing test cases:
The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received body into a dictionary containing the values for the required parameters, and a list of errors encountered during the validation. The function primarily interacts with form data and performs validation and processing based on the parameter definitions.

The failing test cases are related to the handling of Python list, set, and tuple types as form data. In each case, the response status code is expected to be 200, but it is actually 422, indicating a validation error.

The Python list test case is failing because it expects the response to be a list containing the same elements as the input, but the buggy function is not handling the list correctly.

The GitHub issue also provides relevant information, stating that repeated keys in form data are not being handled correctly and only the last key=value is considered, which is not the expected behavior.

Based on this analysis, it's clear that the root cause of the bug is related to the handling of repeated keys in form data and the incorrect processing of Python list, set, and tuple types.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the input form data and correctly process repeated keys, as well as properly extract values for the different sequence types.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None:
        received_data = dict(received_body)
    else:
        received_data = {}
    
    for field in required_params:
        field_value = received_data.get(field.alias)
        if field_value is not None and (isinstance(field_value, list) or isinstance(field_value, set) or isinstance(field_value, tuple)):
            if field.shape == "list":
                values[field.name] = list(field_value)
            elif field.shape == "set":
                values[field.name] = set(field_value)
            elif field.shape == "tuple":
                values[field.name] = tuple(field_value)
        else:
            values[field.name], field_errors = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(field_errors, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(field_errors)
            elif isinstance(field_errors, list):
                errors.extend(field_errors)

    return values, errors
```
In this corrected version, we handle the form data correctly, extracting values for different sequence types, and performing proper validation for the required parameters.

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
