To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to address the issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data. The code currently does not handle this case correctly, resulting in only the last key=value pair being considered.

The bug is likely occurring when the function encounters repeated key=value pairs in the form data, and it only captures the last value instead of building a list of values.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to handle repeated key=value pairs in the form data. This involves checking for the presence of repeated keys and building a list of values for those keys.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        # Create a dictionary to store and group values by field alias
        grouped_values = {}
        
        for field in required_params:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            grouped_values[field.alias] = value
        
        for field in required_params:
            value = grouped_values.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or len(value) == 0:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
                
            # If the field type is File and the value is an UploadFile, read the value
            if (isinstance(field_info, params.File) and
                lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and
                isinstance(value, UploadFile)):
                value = await value.read()
                
            # Validate the field value
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `received_body` is a `FormData` and then group the values by field alias. For each field, we check if there are multiple values associated with the alias and handle them accordingly. We also ensure that for fields of type File, the file is read and validated correctly.

This correction addresses the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data, ensuring that all values for a repeated key are captured and processed correctly.
