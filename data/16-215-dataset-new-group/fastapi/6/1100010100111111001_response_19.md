The bug originates from the incorrect handling of non-list fields when checking if the value is in the request body. The bug results in returning the validated values with errors when using FormData to send sequences, such as a list, a set, or a tuple. The comparison between the shape of the field and the type of the body is incorrect, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the conditions for handling sequences inside the `request_body_to_args` function should be revised to correctly identify and process non-list fields. Additionally, the conditions for setting the values and errors should be reviewed to ensure that the correct values and errors are processed for different field types.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            # Rest of the function remains the same as the original implementation
            # ...
    return values, errors
```
