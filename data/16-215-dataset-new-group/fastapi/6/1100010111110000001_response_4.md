The buggy function `request_body_to_args` appears to incorrectly process the received_body and extract values from it.

The failing test code sends a POST request with data that includes a parameter 'items' as a list, set, or tuple, and expects a 200 status code in the response. However, for all 3 tests, the assertion for the response status code fails with the error "assert 422 == 200".

The potential error location is within the processing of `received_body` parameters in the function `request_body_to_args`.

The cause of the bug in the function is that when processing the received_body, the function fails to correctly extract the values of the parameters and check their validity, leading to errors and incorrect values being returned.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to carefully analyze the extraction of values from the received_body, ensuring that it correctly processes the different sequence types (list, set, tuple) that are expected in the test.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    received_data = dict(received_body) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body
    
    for field in required_params:
        value = received_data.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, instead of transforming the received_body directly, a new dictionary `received_data` is used. This new dictionary `received_data` ensures that the format of the received data is appropriate before processing.

This corrected version should handle the data correctly and should pass the failing tests.
