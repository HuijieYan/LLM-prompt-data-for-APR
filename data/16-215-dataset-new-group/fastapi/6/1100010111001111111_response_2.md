To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we should update the logic to handle repeated keys in form data, as requested in the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data". The current implementation loses repeated keys in form data and only captures the last value, causing the failing tests.

We need to modify the function to handle repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation takes place. Specifically, we should modify the way the function extracts values from the form data and assigns them to the fields.

The updated logic should detect if a field's shape is a sequence and then collect all values for that field in the form data into a list before validation. Additionally, when a field's shape is a set, we should convert the collection of values into a set. This way, the function will properly handle repeated keys for the same field.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                values[field.name] = process_field_value(field, received_body)
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.name))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors

def process_field_value(field: ModelField, received_body: Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]) -> Union[Any, List[Any], Set[Any]]:
    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
        if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, set):
            return set(value)
        return value
    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
    if (
        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
        and len(value) == 0
    ):
        if field.required:
            return value
        return deepcopy(field.default)
    return value
```

In the corrected version, we have added a `process_field_value` function to handle the extraction of values from the form data. This function correctly processes the field's value by checking if the shape is a sequence and collecting all values into a list and, when appropriate, converting those values into a set.

With this updated logic, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly handle repeated keys in form data, and the failing tests should pass as expected.
