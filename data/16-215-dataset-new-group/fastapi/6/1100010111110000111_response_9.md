The issue is related to the `request_body_to_args` function in the `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py` file that is unable to handle repeated key=value pairs in form data. This results in validation errors and the failing of the associated test cases for list, set, and tuple parameters passed in the form data.

The potential error locations within the `request_body_to_args` function are:

1. Handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data.
2. Validation of form data that contain sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not appropriately handling repeated key=value pairs in form data, which results in a misinterpretation of the received data, leading to validation errors and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be modified to handle repeated key=value pairs in form data correctly. This can be achieved by checking for duplicate keys in the received form data and treating them as sequences when encountered. Additionally, the validation logic needs to be updated to properly handle sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

                # Check for repeated key=value pairs and convert to sequences
                if len(value) > 1:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = cast(List[Any], value)
                    elif field.shape == "set":
                        value = set(value)
                    value = list(value) if field.shape == "tuple" else value

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we handle repeated key=value pairs in the form data, converting them to sequences when appropriate. We also update the validation logic to handle sequences of different types correctly.

With this corrected version, the failing test cases for list, set, and tuple parameters should be resolved, and the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value in form data should also be addressed.
