To fix the buggy function, we can update the logic for handling non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples. We also need to ensure that the appropriate values and errors are returned.

The issue with the current implementation is that it does not correctly handle non-typing sequences in the received body. Specifically, it fails to properly extract the values from the non-typing sequences when they are present in the form data. Additionally, the error handling for non-typing sequences is not consistent and can lead to incorrect errors being generated.

To address this, we should modify the logic for handling non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples. We can keep track of the shape of the field and then extract the values accordingly. Additionally, the error handling should be updated to ensure that the correct errors are appended to the `errors` list based on the type of non-typing sequences.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body[field.alias]
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape == 1:
                    value = [value]
                else:
                    value = set(value)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File):
                if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over the `required_params` to extract the values from the received body based on the field's shape. We also correctly handle the error generation based on the type of non-typing sequences. By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
