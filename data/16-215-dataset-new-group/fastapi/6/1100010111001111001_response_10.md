Based on the provided information, it appears that the buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing to correctly process FormData input for parameters of type list, set, and tuple. Here's a summary of the issue and a proposed fix:

### Issue:
1. The function should handle FormData input for non-typing sequences (like lists, sets, tuples) but currently, it does not handle them correctly.
2. The function returns incorrect values and errors, and doesn't account for the unique characteristics of list, set, and tuple types.

### Proposed fix:
1. Modify the function to properly handle FormData input for non-typing sequence types (list, set, tuple).
2. Update the processing logic to handle these non-typing sequence types based on their characteristics.
3. Ensure that the function returns the expected values and errors based on the unique characteristics of list, set, and tuple types.

### Updated Corrected Version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(field.type_, list) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                elif isinstance(field.type_, set) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # Rest of the validation logic remains unchanged
    return values, errors
```
The above corrected version of the function should handle FormData input for list, set, and tuple types correctly based on their unique characteristics and return the expected values and errors.
