The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing due to the mishandling of repeated keys in the form data. When multiple values with the same key are present in the form data, only the last value is being considered, resulting in a validation error.

The potential error locations within the `request_body_to_args` function are:
1. The conditional check for `embed` is incorrect and can lead to the incorrect assignment of the `received_body` variable.
2. The conditional checks for different types of form data are erroneous and need to address the handling of repeated keys to form a list.

The bug is failing the tests because the function is not correctly handling the repeated keys in form data. The function incorrectly determines the data type and values, leading to validation errors.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for different types of form data need to be updated to correctly handle the repeated keys and form them into a list.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            values[field.alias] = received_values
        else:
            for field in required_params:
                value: Any = None
                if received_body is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                    ):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                        
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and len(value) == 0)
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

The corrected function addresses the mishandling of repeated keys and properly forms them into a list. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
