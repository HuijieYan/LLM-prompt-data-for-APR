The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling repeated keys in form data, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function is not properly handling multiple values for the same key in the received form data. It only considers the last value for each key, which is not the expected behavior.

The potential error location is the block of code that processes the received form data and assigns values to the `values` dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle cases where a key in the form data has multiple values correctly. It only considers the last value for each key and does not create a list of values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that processes the form data so that it properly handles multiple values for the same key and stores them as a list in the `values` dictionary.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            raw_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if raw_value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                value = raw_value[0] if len(raw_value) == 1 else raw_value
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the `required_params` and use `received_body.getlist` to get all the values for the given key if the received body is of type `FormData`. We then store the values in the `values` dictionary accordingly as a list when multiple values are available for the same key.

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub problem statement and handles repeated key=value pairs correctly.
