To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to ensure that when the input received_body is a FormData and the field shape is in sequence_shapes (such as a list, set, or tuple), we correctly handle the case where the field is a list type and multiple values are provided for the same key. Currently, the function only captures the last value instead of all values, leading to failed tests and a GitHub issue.

One strategy to fix the bug is to modify the logic for handling sequence shapes in the `request_body_to_args` function by improving the handling of FormData when multiple values are provided for the same key. We should check the field alias and process multiple values appropriately to ensure they are captured as a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData) and field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if field.shape == "list":
                        value = [cast(Union[str, bytes], v) for v in value]
                    elif field.shape == "set":
                        value = set(cast(Sequence[Union[str, bytes]], value))
                    elif field.shape == "tuple":
                        value = tuple(cast(Sequence[Union[str, bytes]], value))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            # ... (other existing logic remains unchanged)
            # (the rest of the function follows with the existing logic)
            # ...
```

In the corrected version, we added conditions to check for the field alias in the received_body and retrieve the values using `getlist` instead of just `get` for fields with sequence shapes. We then convert the values to the appropriate sequence type (list, set, or tuple) based on the field shape.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the multiple values in FormData for sequence-shaped fields correctly, resolving the failing tests and also addressing the GitHub issue.
