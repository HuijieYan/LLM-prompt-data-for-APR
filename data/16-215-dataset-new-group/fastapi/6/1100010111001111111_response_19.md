The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails when converting form data with repeated keys into lists, sets, and tuples. This causes the failing test issue and is also linked to a GitHub issue to resolve a problem with repeated key=value pairs in form data.

The potential error location in the function is with the handling of repeated keys in the received body and the subsequent validation and assignment to the fields.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys in the received body correctly. It only takes the last value for a specific key, leading to issues when trying to convert them into lists, sets, and tuples.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys by converting them into appropriate data structures and then assign those values correctly to the model fields for validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is not None:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    values[field.name] = value
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value[-1]  # Take the last value for non-sequence fields
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, for each field in required_params, the function checks if the corresponding values are present in the received_body. If present, it handles repeated keys appropriately and assigns the values to the model fields for validation. It also correctly handles missing values for required fields.

This corrected version should resolve the issue in the failing test cases and address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
