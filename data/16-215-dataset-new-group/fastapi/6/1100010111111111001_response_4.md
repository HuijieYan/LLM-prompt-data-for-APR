The cause of the bug is that the function `request_body_to_args` is not handling form data correctly for certain types of input fields (such as list, set, tuple). Instead of setting the field alias key to the value, the function is converting it into a list and storing it, which results in incorrect behavior when the data is returned.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to first identify the input type for the form field and then handle the value accordingly. For list, set, and tuple types, the incoming data should be handled as elements and the field alias should be set for each element.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is not None:
            value: Any = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
        else:
            value = None

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            values[field.name], v_errors = field.validate(value, {}, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if v_errors:
                errors.extend(v_errors)

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should handle form data correctly for different types of input fields and pass the failing test cases.
