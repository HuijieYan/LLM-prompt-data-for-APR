The `request_body_to_args` function seems to be used to convert request body parameters to arguments. However, there are some potential error locations in the function that could lead to the failing tests. Specifically, the issue might be related to the handling of sequence shapes (list, set, tuple) when received as form data.

Potential bug: The handling of sequence-shaped fields (list, set, tuple) when received as form data may not work correctly, causing the failing tests.

Suggested fix: Update the conditionals and type checking related to sequence-shaped fields in the `request_body_to_args` function to ensure that they are correctly handled when received as form data. Specifically, pay attention to the extraction of values when `received_body` is not None, and handle the cases of list, set, and tuple appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the potential issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value = None

        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.required
            and (value == "" or (field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0))
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version addresses the potential issues with handling sequence-shaped fields, and it should ensure that the function passes the failing tests without any issues.
