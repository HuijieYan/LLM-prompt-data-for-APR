The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to the way it processes the input data and constructs the response. Specifically, it is failing to correctly handle sequences (lists, sets, and tuples) when parsing the received body.

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle sequences properly and also does not consider the type of the field when parsing the received body. It should account for different types of sequence fields such as lists, sets, and tuples.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle sequence fields and different types of sequences correctly. This can be achieved by updating the conditionals to check for different sequence types and their corresponding operations. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function is able to validate different sequence types in the body data.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field.shape == 3 and isinstance(received_body, FormData):  # Check for Set type
                    value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                elif field.shape == 4 and isinstance(received_body, FormData):  # Check for Tuple type
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This updated version of the function will correctly handle different types of sequence fields (list, set, tuple) and validate the values accordingly. This should resolve the issue with failing tests for sequences.
