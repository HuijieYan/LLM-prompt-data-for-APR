The buggy function is `request_body_to_args` and is used to process the received request body and validate the values against the required parameters.

### Bugs in the Function
The function contains multiple bugs, causing it to fail with the given test cases. The errors are due to inaccurate handling of sequence shapes (like list, set, tuple) within the function.

1. Incorrect Validation: The function does not validate the sequence shapes of the received body correctly.
2. Error Collection: The function fails to collect errors properly for the requested sequence shapes, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs
To fix the bugs, the function needs to accurately handle sequence shapes and collect errors in case of unsuccessful validation.

1. Correctly validate the sequence shapes of the received body.
2. Properly collect errors for the requested sequence shapes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                seq_shapes = [params.List, params.Set, params.Tuple]
                if isinstance(field_info, tuple(seq_shapes)):
                    shape_index = seq_shapes.index(type(field_info))
                    if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if shape_index == 0 else received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if shape_index == 2:  # Tuple
                    value = tuple(value)
                elif shape_index == 1:  # Set
                    value = set(value)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, I added conditionals to check the sequence shapes and handle the value correctly depending on the shape while ensuring the proper collection of errors.

The corrected function should now pass the provided failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
