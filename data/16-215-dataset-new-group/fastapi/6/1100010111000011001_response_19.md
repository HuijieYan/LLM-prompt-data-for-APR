The buggy function `request_body_to_args` takes a list of required parameters and a dictionary of received body data as inputs and returns a tuple of a dictionary of values and a list of errors. The function iterates over the required parameters, extracts the corresponding values from the received body, and validates them before returning the final values and errors.

The potential error location occurs in the conditionals for extracting values from the received body and in the validation process. It seems that the code for shaping the values and validating them may not be handling non-typing sequences (e.g., lists, sets, tuples) correctly, leading to the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle non-typing sequences when processing the received body, resulting in incorrect values and validation errors.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle non-typing sequences in the received body and to properly validate them according to the expected parameter types.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        received_body = dict(received_body)  # Convert FormData to dict
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default) if field.default is not None else None
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we first convert `FormData` to a dictionary to ensure consistent processing. Then, we iterate over the required parameters, extract the corresponding values from the received body, and validate them according to the field type. If a value is missing and the field is required, we append a MissingError to the errors list, otherwise, we use the default value if available. Finally, we return the values and errors.
