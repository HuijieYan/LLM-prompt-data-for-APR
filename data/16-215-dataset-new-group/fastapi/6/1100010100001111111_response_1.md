## Correction:

The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is due to the incorrect handling of repeated keys in form data, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. The function fails to correctly process repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle repeated keys in form data and assign their values as a list, as requested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
     if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
      values = received_body.multi_items()
      for field in required_params:
       if field.required and field.alias not in values:
        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
       elif field.alias in values and not values[field.alias]:
        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
         values[field.alias] = []
        elif not isinstance(values[field.alias], list):
         values[field.alias] = [values[field.alias]]
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.alias], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
       if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
        errors.append(errors_)
       elif isinstance(errors_, list):
        errors.extend(errors_)
       else:
        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check if the `received_body` is a `FormData`.
- If it is, we use the `multi_items()` method to extract all the values with repeated keys as a list.
- Then, we iterate through the required params and check for missing values and perform the necessary validations as per the field's requirements.
- The `values` dictionary contains the processed values with repeated keys correctly handled as lists.

With this correction, the function now correctly handles repeated keys in form data and processes the values as lists, effectively resolving the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
