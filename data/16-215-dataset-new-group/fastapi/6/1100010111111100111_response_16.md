To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, it seems that the main issue is related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The function should be modified to support repeated key-value pairs and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the input data when handling form data with repeated keys, and this is consistent with the bug reported in the GitHub issue. The function needs to be updated to properly handle repeated keys in form data.

It's likely that the current implementation does not properly interpret form data with repeated keys and hence the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the `request_body_to_args` function should be modified to properly identify repeated keys and treat them as lists of values before validation.

Here's a potential strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Identify the sections of the code that handle form data and repeated keys.
2. Update the logic to properly handle form data with repeated keys, ensuring that the values are processed as lists.
3. Test the modified function with the failing test cases to ensure that the issue is resolved.

After identifying and understanding the bug, the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function is provided below, considering the handling of repeated keys in form data.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    field_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if len(field_values) == 1:
                        value = field_values[0]
                    else:
                        value = field_values
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = value if value is not None else deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version of the function, `getlist` is used to obtain a list of values for repeated keys in the form data. If there's only one value, it's assigned directly as the value for that field. If there are multiple values, they are stored as a list.

This modification ensures that the `request_body_to_args` function properly handles form data with repeated keys and successfully resolves the issue reported in the GitHub post.
