### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is used to convert the request body into arguments, based on the required parameters. It seems that the issue is related to how the function handles repeated keys in form data. This is supported by the GitHub issue pointing out that repeated keys are not properly handled when using `Form` in the request.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The function appears to only handle the last value for a given key, instead of assigning those values to a list.

### Bug Cause:
The function `request_body_to_args` doesn't handle repeated keys in form data properly. When a key has multiple values, only the last value is considered, which contradicts the expected behavior as pointed out in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to properly collect and assign repeated keys in form data as a list before validation.
2. Update the parsing logic to handle repeated keys in form data, possibly using a mapping structure to collect all values for each key.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in reversed(required_params):  # Reversing the iteration to handle repeated keys
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Using getlist to handle repeated keys
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:  # Checking if value exists
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    field_info, params.Form
                ):
                    values[field.name] = list(value)  # Assigning a list of values for repeated keys
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
``` 

This corrected version accounts for repeated keys in form data by using `getlist` to retrieve all values for a key as a list, and then assigning that list to the corresponding field in `values`. This approach aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug.
