Based on the runtime values and expected values, it seems like the issue is related to handling repeated keys in form data. The function `request_body_to_args` should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation, as requested in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations in the function are related to the handling of sequence shapes and field types. It seems that the function is not properly checking for repeated keys in the form data and converting them to a list for validation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data, leading to incorrect validation and values. This behavior does not align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, which requests the values to be collected as a list for the same key before validation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data and assign their values as a list before validation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is not None:
                        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                            values[field.name] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = value
                    else:
                        if field.required:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```
In this corrected version, the function explicitly checks for repeated keys in the form data and assigns their values as a list before validation. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
