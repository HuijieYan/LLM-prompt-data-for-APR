Based on the error messages and the failing tests, it seems that the `request_body_to_args` function is not correctly handling the input data when dealing with multiple items or sequences inside the request body. The failing tests indicate that the expected status code should be 200, but it's returning 422 indicating a validation error.

The cause of this bug is that the function is not properly extracting values from the request body when dealing with lists, sets, and tuples as form input data. It is not correctly handling the sequence shapes and is likely not validating the input data properly when multiple items are present.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle multiple items or sequence shapes as form input data. We need to handle lists, sets, and tuples differently than single values and ensure that we validate each item properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we now loop through each field and properly handle the sequence shapes, extract values, and validate them. This should ensure that the function correctly handles form input data with multiple items or sequences.

After the correction, the failing tests should now pass as the function will handle the input data correctly and return the expected 200 status code.
