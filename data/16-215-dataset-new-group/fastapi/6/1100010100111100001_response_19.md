To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function. The bug is caused by improper handling of non-typed sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples in the `received_body`. These sequences are being incorrectly processed as strings, and their validation is not being confirmed properly. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if the input value is an instance of `sequence_types`, and if so, process each item within the sequence accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    value = [value]  # Convert to a list
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the cases provided should now pass without throwing the assertion errors.
