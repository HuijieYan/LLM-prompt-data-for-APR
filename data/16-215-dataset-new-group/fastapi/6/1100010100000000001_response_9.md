## Analysis:
The function `request_body_to_args` appears to be designed to take a list of required parameters and received body data, and then extract the values for the required parameters from the body data. However, the function has a complex logic and several potential error locations, including handling missing values, form validation errors, and file uploads.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. Error handling for missing values
2. Validation errors for form fields
3. Reading and processing file uploads

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is likely related to the complex logic for handling the different types of fields and values. It's possible that the function is not correctly extracting and validating the values from the received body data, leading to incorrect or missing output.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling missing values and form validation errors to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.
2. Check the logic for reading and processing file uploads to verify it correctly handles the file data.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body[field.alias]
            try:
                v_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                values[field.name] = v_
            except Exception as e:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(e, loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we simplified the logic to iterate through the required fields and extract their values from the received body data. We use the `validate` method of the field to perform field validation and handle missing values by checking for the presence of the field in the received body. This approach simplifies the logic and addresses potential issues with missing values and form validation errors.
