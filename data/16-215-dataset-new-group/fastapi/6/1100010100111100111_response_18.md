The issue is related to the `request_body_to_args` function which fails to handle repeated keys in form data. This is evident in the failing tests where the status code returned is incorrect due to the inability to handle repeated keys in form data.

The bug is caused by the incorrect processing of repeated keys in the form data, as it is not transformed into a list as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle cases where a field should accept repeated keys in the form data and transform them into a list for further processing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = defaultdict(list)
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        values[field.name] = []
    
    if received_body is not None:
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            if key in values:
                values[key].append(value)
        
    for field in required_params:
        value = values[field.name]
        if not value and field.required:
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:  # pragma: nocover
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                )
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return dict(values), errors
```

In the corrected version, a `defaultdict` of lists is used to collect all the values corresponding to the repeated keys. Then, the values are validated in a loop and the errors are collected as before. This ensures that the form data with repeated keys is handled correctly.

This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread titled "Support repeated key=value in form data".
