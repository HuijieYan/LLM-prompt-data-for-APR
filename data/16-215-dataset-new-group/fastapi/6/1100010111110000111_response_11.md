Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, the bug is likely related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data. The issue describes how FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list to the same key before validation, which is not currently being handled in the `request_body_to_args` function.

The potential error location in the function could be the handling of repeated keys in the `received_body`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys in the form data properly. When multiple values are provided for a key, only the last value is considered, leading to incorrect validation and an HTTP 422 status code being returned.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated keys properly by collecting all values for a key and assigning them as a list to the same key before validation occurs.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:  # pragma: nocover
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we loop through the required params and handle the received body to collect all values for a key if it's present. We then validate the values and store them in the `values` dictionary.

By making these changes, the function should now handle repeated keys in the form data properly, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
