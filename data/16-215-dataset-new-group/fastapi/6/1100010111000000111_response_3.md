## Analysis
The function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the request body into arguments to be used by the FastAPI framework. However, it seems to have a bug related to handling repeated keys in form data, which causes the failing test cases to produce unexpected results.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The handling of repeated keys in the form data may be incorrect.
2. The logic to extract and validate values from the form data may be flawed.

## Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` does not handle the case of repeated keys in form data properly, leading to unexpected behavior when validating and extracting the values. This causes the failing test cases to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. This will involve updating the logic for extracting and validating values from the form data, ensuring that repeated keys are properly processed and validated.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
        else:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle repeated keys in form data and correctly extract and validate the values for the required fields.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.
