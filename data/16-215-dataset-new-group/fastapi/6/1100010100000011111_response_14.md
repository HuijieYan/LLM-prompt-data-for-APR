The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is used to convert the request body to arguments, but it has multiple issues causing it to fail. The function is not handling repeated key=value pairs in form data correctly. The GitHub issue also confirms that the function is not collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list before validation.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Handling repeated key=value pairs in form data incorrectly.
2. Incorrect validation logic for the fields.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not collecting repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives and is not assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens, as requested in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation. Additionally, the validation logic needs to be updated to handle the collected values correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body[field.alias]
                if not value:  # Handle missing or empty values
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    if not field.sub_fields:
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
                    else:
                        # Handle field with sub-fields
                        sub_values, sub_errors = await request_body_to_args(field.sub_fields, value)
                        values[field.name] = sub_values
                        errors.extend(sub_errors)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the `required_params` and checks if the field's alias exists in the `received_body`. If it does, it collects the values as a list using `getlist` for `FormData` inputs, or simply retrieves the value. It then handles missing or empty values, and for non-empty values, it validates them using the `validate` method. If the field has sub-fields, it recursively calls `request_body_to_args` to handle nested fields.

This corrected version should now successfully handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and correctly validate the fields, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
