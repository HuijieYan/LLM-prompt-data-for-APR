The provided function `request_body_to_args` has several issues leading to the failing test cases. There are inconsistencies in how the function handles different types of fields such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is not correctly populating the `values` dictionary and accumulating any potential `errors`.

Here's an analysis of the issues present in the buggy function:

1. The function fails to correctly populate the `values` dictionary for non-List, non-Set, non-Tuple fields.
2. The type-specific checks and validations for different kinds of sequence-shaped fields are not being handled properly.

To fix these issues, we can improve the logic for populating the `values` dictionary and accurately accumulating any potential `errors` while processing the request body.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]

                if (field.shape in sequence_shapes) and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)

                if value is None and field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = list(value) if isinstance(value, set) else value
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_

            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))

    return values, errors
```

With this updated function, the input parameters are handled based on the received values. The function should now correctly populate the `values` dictionary based on the received values. Additionally, it appropriately accumulates and returns any potential `errors`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
