The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is caused by the handling of sequence shapes and the value of the received body in the loop. The bug causes incorrect validation and errors in the function, leading to the failing test cases you provided.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle sequence shapes and the value of the received body in the loop, as well as the validation of the field. Additionally, the bug seems to lead to incorrect error handling, as the function should not be returning a 422 status code instead of the expected 200.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should now pass the failing test cases without returning a 422 status code.
