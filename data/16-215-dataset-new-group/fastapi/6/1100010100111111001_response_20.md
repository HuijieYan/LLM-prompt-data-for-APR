The bug in the provided function is due to incorrect validation for non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples. This leads to an incorrect behavior when processing the received body data for these types of fields.

The cause of this bug is that the function does not handle the validation and processing of non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples correctly. This results in the function returning the wrong values and errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to appropriately validate and process non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples, based on their respective field types and shapes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function handles the validation and processing of non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples based on their shapes and field types.

With the corrected function, the failing tests are expected to pass.
