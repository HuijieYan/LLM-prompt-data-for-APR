The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely causing the failing tests because it is not handling non-typing sequences properly. Specifically, it is not accounting for the fact that non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples, are being passed as form data, which is causing the function to fail when validating the input parameters.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle non-typing sequences when they are passed as form data, such that the input parameters are properly validated.

Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.name in received_body:
                    value = received_body[field.name]
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, {}, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle non-typing sequences when they are passed as form data, and it should allow the failing tests to pass.
