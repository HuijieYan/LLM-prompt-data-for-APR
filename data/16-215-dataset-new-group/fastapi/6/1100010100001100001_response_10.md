The issue with the buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be related to the `embed` attribute of the `field_info` object. In the provided cases, the `field_info` is of type `Form`, and its `embed` attribute is set to `True`. This causes the received body to be embedded using the field's alias as the key when only one required parameter is present and `embed` is `True`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `embed` logic works correctly and that the data is accessed and processed appropriately in the loop where the fields are iterated.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        len_required_params = len(required_params)
        first_field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(first_field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        
        if len_required_params == 1 and embed:
            received_body = {first_field.alias: received_body}
            
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            # ... (rest of the logic stays the same)

    return values, errors
```

In the fixed code, we ensure that the embed logic is based on the first required field and that the data is accessed and processed for each field within the loop. This should address the issue related to the embedded body and lead to the correct behavior of the function for the provided test cases.
