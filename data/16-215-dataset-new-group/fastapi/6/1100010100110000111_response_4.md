To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to modify the code to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. The bug is causing the tests to fail with a 422 status code, indicating a validation error. This is due to the fact that repeated keys are not being handled as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function `request_body_to_args` does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly, leading to a validation error when using lists, sets, or tuples as form data in the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated keys in form data properly. Specifically, when iterating through the `required_params` and checking for the presence of values in the `received_body`, we need to account for repeated keys and process them as lists.

The fixed version of the function is provided below:

```python
from fastapi import Query

# Fix the buggy function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Handle repeated keys as a list
                if not value:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)  # If not a list, get the single value

            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                # Handle form data of sequence shapes separately (e.g., lists, tuples, sets)
                converted_value = [field.type_(v) for v in value]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(converted_value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the fixed version of the function:
- We iterate through `required_params` and use `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` to handle repeated keys as a list.
- If the value is not a list, we fall back to `received_body.get(field.alias)` to get the single value.
- We handle form data of sequence shapes separately by converting the values to the appropriate sequence type and then validating them using `field.validate`.

By making these changes, the `request_body_to_args` function should now handle repeated keys in form data correctly, resolving the validation errors in the failing tests. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to supporting repeated key=value in form data.
