The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to take a list of required parameters and a received body and return a dictionary of values and a list of errors. However, there are several potential errors in the function, such as incorrect handling of form data and incorrect validation of field values. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not correctly handling non-typing sequences in the received form data.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly processing the received form data for non-typing sequences (such as list, set, and tuple). It is failing to properly handle the received data and validate it against the required parameters, leading to incorrect results and errors.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to correctly process non-typing sequences in the received form data and validate them against the required parameters. This can be done by checking the type of the received data and appropriately handling non-typing sequence shapes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = field.default
                continue
            if isinstance(field.type_, list) and isinstance(value, list):
                values[field.name] = value
            elif isinstance(field.type_, set) and isinstance(value, list):
                values[field.name] = set(value)
            elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple) and isinstance(value, list):
                values[field.name] = tuple(value)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version properly processes the received form data and validates it against the required parameters, handling non-typing sequences (list, set, and tuple) appropriately. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
