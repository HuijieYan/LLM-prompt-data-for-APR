The bug in the provided function `request_body_to_args` is related to the handling of input data for non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) when received as form data. The bug causes the function to set the values of the required parameters inappropriately, leading to incorrect validation and potentially missing validation errors.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of non-typing sequences, especially when they are received as form data. The function fails to correctly handle the values of non-typing sequences, leading to incorrect interpretation and validation of the received data.

To address this issue, the bug can be fixed by implementing the following strategies:
1. Ensure that the form data for non-typing sequences is correctly interpreted and processed according to the expected field types.
2. Validate non-typing sequences against their respective types and handle errors appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from pydantic import ListError, SetError, TupleError

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "" or len(value) == 0:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(get_error_instance(field.shape), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors

def get_error_instance(shape):
    if shape == 0:
        return ListError()
    elif shape == 1:
        return SetError()
    elif shape == 2:
        return TupleError()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid shape value for non-typing sequence.")
```

In the corrected version, the function checks the shape of the field and properly handles form data for non-typing sequences. Additionally, it uses the appropriate error instance based on the shape of the non-typing sequence for better error reporting during validation.

With these changes, the corrected function should address the existing bug and pass the failing tests while satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
