The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to process received form data and extract values for the required fields, while handling different data shapes. However, the current implementation has multiple issues, such as incorrect handling of sequence shapes and improper validation. As a result, the function fails to correctly process inputs of Python list, set, and tuple data types, leading to failing tests.

The main issues in the buggy function include:
1. Improper handling of sequence shapes for form data.
2. Incorrect validation of form data and assignment of errors.
3. Inconsistent application of field information.

To fix the buggy function, we need to address these issues and improve the handling of different sequence shapes and their validation. Additionally, we need to ensure that errors are properly assigned and returned.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        elif value is None:
            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, error = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if error:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(error, loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function:
- We no longer use `FormData.get` to extract values as it can lead to incorrect handling of sequence shapes.
- We directly check if the field's alias exists in the received body and extract its value.
- Proper validation of the field value is done using `field.validate`.
- Errors are added to the errors list as `ErrorWrapper` instances for consistent handling.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and correctly process inputs of different sequence shapes.
