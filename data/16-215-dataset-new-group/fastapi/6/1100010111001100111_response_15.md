The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has an issue with handling repeated keys in form data, which causes it to not recognize and validate them correctly. This behavior contradicts the expected outcome from the issue raised in the GitHub problem statement.

The potential errors in the function can be identified in the section where it handles the form data to extract the field values. It seems to treat the form field values of the same name as separate and does not collect them into a list before validation.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly, which causes it to not validate them as expected. This results in the failing tests, as the function does not process the repeated keys as lists as required.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to recognize repeated keys in form data and collect their values into a list before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if value:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                    MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the section that retrieves the field values and validates them. We now use the `getlist` method to collect the values for repeated keys into a list, and then directly validate and assign the values to the `values` dictionary. This modification ensures that the function correctly handles repeated keys in form data.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
