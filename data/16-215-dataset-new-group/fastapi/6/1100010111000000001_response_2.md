The buggy function `request_body_to_args` appears to be intended to take a list of required parameters and a received body, and attempt to extract and validate values for those parameters from the received body. However, there are a number of potential error locations within the function. The function has a complex logic to handle different cases which can lead to various errors.

The cause of the bug is that when the received body is a dictionary with an alias used as its key and the parameter `required_params` list only has one field, the value is unpacked into `received_body` dictionary with the alias as its key. This should not be done as it conflicts with the following logic.

To fix the bug, it seems necessary only to extend the `received_body` dictionary after checking whether it is a Form Data. As a result, the dictionary should not be overwritten.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not getattr(get_field_info(required_params[0]), "embed", None):
            field = required_params[0]
            values[field.alias] = received_body.get(field.alias)
        else:
            for field in required_params:
                value: Any = None
                if received_body is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                    ):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:  # pragma: nocover
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary assignment to `received_body` when there's only one field in `required_params` and provides a more readable and functional way of handling request body extraction and validation.
