## Analysis
The error messages indicate that the response status codes are 422, which means there is a validation error. This suggests that the function `request_body_to_args` is not handling repeated key-value pairs in form data properly, leading to a validation error.

In the GitHub issue, the user is requesting support for repeated key-value pairs in form data to be collected as a list and assigned to the same key before validation.

## Error Location
The error is caused by the handling of repeated key-value pairs in the `request_body_to_args` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data. When multiple values are received for the same key in form data, only the last value is being processed, leading to validation errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to collect repeated key-value pairs as a list and assign those values to the same key before validation.

## Updated Function
Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body[field.alias]
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = [v for v in value]
            if value is not None:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```
In the updated function, we check if the `received_body` is not None and iterate through the required parameters. We fetch the value from the `received_body` using the field's alias and handle repeated key-value pairs correctly by using `getlist` for `FormData` and directly indexing for dictionaries. If the value is not None, it is validated and stored in the results. If the field is required and the value is None, a MissingError is added to the errors list.

With this updated function, the repeated key-value pairs in form data will be collected correctly as a list and assigned to the same key before validation, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub issue and fixing the bug causing the failing tests.

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should resolve the reported issue and pass the failing tests.
