Looking at the buggy function, it seems to be designed to convert the received body (either a dictionary or FormData) into arguments based on the required parameters provided. The function then returns a dictionary of values and a list of errors.

The potential errors in the function could be related to the processing of different types of required parameters (e.g., list, set, tuple) and how the received body is handled and validated for each parameter.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the function correctly generates the values and errors based on the received body and required parameters in various cases (Cases 1, 2, and 3).

A possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to review how the function handles different shapes and types of required parameters, ensure that it correctly extracts and validates the values from the received body, and properly updates the values and errors based on the validation outcomes.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.name in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.name]
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version:
- We loop through the required parameters and directly try to extract the value from the received body using the field name.
- If the value is None and the field is required, we append a MissingError to the errors list.
- Otherwise, we validate the extracted value and update the values and errors accordingly.

This corrected version should handle various shapes and types of required parameters and validate the received body values more accurately.
