The cause of the bug in the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of different shapes of input data, such as lists, sets, and tuples, and how this affects the value assigned to the "value" variable. Additionally, the "received_body" variable is not being properly handled when processing multiple input items.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve updating the logic for handling different shapes of input data and ensuring that the "received_body" is correctly processed when it contains multiple items.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape == 1 and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if field.shape == 1 and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[field.name] = value
            elif field.shape > 1 and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values[field.name] = tuple(value)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling different shapes of input data has been simplified and clarified, and the "received_body" is correctly processed when it contains multiple items. This should address the bug and ensure the function processes the input data correctly.
