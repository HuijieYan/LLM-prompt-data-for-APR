To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `request_body_to_args` function correctly handles the case when a list, set, or tuple is passed as form data. Specifically, we need to iterate through the received body to get the values for each field, taking into consideration the specific shape of the field and handling repeated keys appropriately.

One potential error in the buggy function is that the code for processing the received body does not handle cases where a list, set, or tuple is passed as form data correctly. Additionally, the logic for error handling and value validation needs to be reviewed to ensure it functions as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when a list, set, or tuple is passed as form data. This leads to incorrect values being assigned to the `values` dictionary, as well as errors not being raised when they should be, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, a new approach should be used to handle form data input containing lists, sets, or tuples. Specifically, the function should iterate through the received body to handle each field properly, taking into account the shape of the field and any repeated keys. Additionally, the error handling and value validation logic should be revised to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
            value = await value.read()
        elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(
                field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the special handling for single fields and replaced it with a more generalized approach that iterates through the required parameters. We have also revised the logic for handling form data input with lists, sets, or tuples to ensure that they are processed correctly. Additionally, the error handling and value validation logic have been updated to match the expected behavior.

With these changes, the `request_body_to_args` function should now correctly handle the input parameters and satisfy the expected output values, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
