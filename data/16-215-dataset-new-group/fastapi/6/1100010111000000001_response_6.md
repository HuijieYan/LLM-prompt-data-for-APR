The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to process required parameters and validate values, then return the validated values and any errors. However, it is failing to process various types of form field parameters such as Python lists, sets, and tuples.

The buggy function assumes that the `received_body` parameter contains a mapping of fields to values, but when the field is an embed and there is only one required param, it updates `received_body` to have the alias as the key and the entire received body as the value. This seems to be incorrect. Also, the handling of fields that are part of sequences, like lists, sets, and tuples may not be correct.

To fix the bug, the handling of received_body and the validation and processing of sequence-shaped fields needs to be revised.

Here's a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:

    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                elif field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
                
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
``` 

The corrected version of the function includes revised handling of the received_body, and the validation and processing of sequence-shaped fields. This should resolve the issues with processing Python lists, sets, and tuples as form field parameters and should pass the failing tests.
