The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to how it handles form data with repeated keys. The function is not correctly processing repeated keys within the form data, leading to the incorrect validation and response codes in the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters a form field with a sequence shape (list, set, tuple) and if the received data is an instance of FormData, it should correctly handle the case where the key has multiple values. However, in the current implementation, the function does not account for this scenario, leading to the incorrect validation and response codes observed in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle form data with repeated keys and should extract the multiple values for the same key and process them according to the sequence shape (list, set, tuple) of the field.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        if field.shape in (1, 3):
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        elif field.shape == 2:
                            value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, when the function encounters a form field with a sequence shape and the received data is an instance of FormData, it correctly handles the case of repeated keys and processes them according to the sequence shape (list, set, tuple) of the field.

With this correction, the failing tests should pass, and the issue posted on GitHub regarding supporting repeated key=value in form data should also be resolved.
