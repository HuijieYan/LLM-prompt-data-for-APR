## Analysis
The issue on GitHub is related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data. The current function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for extracting values from request body and handling errors if any. However, it seems that the function does not support collecting repeated keys in the 2-tuple list and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

## Potential Error Locations
- Parsing of repeated key=value pairs in form data.
- Handling of errors when dealing with repeated keys.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the function `request_body_to_args` does not handle repeated key=value pairs in form data correctly. It only captures the last key=value pair, and this behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `request_body_to_args` to support collecting repeated keys in the 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This involves handling the parsing of repeated key=value pairs and ensuring the correct assignment of values to the same key.

## Corrected Version
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        value = list(value)
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        value = [await v.read() for v in value]
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                elif field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now supports parsing repeated key=value pairs in form data and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

This will address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
