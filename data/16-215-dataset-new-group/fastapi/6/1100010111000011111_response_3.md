The buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be attempting to convert the received body into arguments, while handling different types of sequence shapes. However, it appears that the function is not handling repeated keys in form data properly, which is consistent with the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data". 

Upon reviewing the failing test cases, it is clear that the function is not handling repeated keys in form data properly. Instead of creating a list of values for the repeated key, it is currently only capturing the last value.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data by assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function that should resolve the issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    # Modify the received_body to handle repeated keys and create lists for those keys
    modified_received_body = {}
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for key in received_body.keys():
            if key in modified_received_body:
                modified_received_body[key].append(received_body.get(key))
            else:
                modified_received_body[key] = [received_body.get(key)]
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if modified_received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = modified_received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = modified_received_body.get(field.alias)
                
        # Remaining code for validation and error handling remains unchanged

    return values, errors
```

With the modified version of the function, it should now properly handle repeated keys in form data and create lists for those keys before validation. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and also pass the failing test cases.
