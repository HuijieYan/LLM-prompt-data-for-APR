The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to parse the body of a request and validate it based on the provided required parameters. After analyzing the runtime values and expected values, the issue appears to be related to how the function handles the received body. 

From the provided cases and expected values, it appears that the function is not handling the received body correctly, resulting in incomplete or incorrect values at the function's return. This could be due to the conditional statements and how the body is processed based on the `required_params`, `field_info`, and `value`.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the conditional statements and the way the received body is processed, keeping in mind the shape and types of the parameters specified in `required_params`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field_info.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue

                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field_info.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now accurately processes the `received_body` based on the properties of `required_params` and `field_info`, forming the `values` and `errors` accordingly. This revised version addresses the bug by handling the conditional logic more effectively and ensures the correct processing of the received data based on specified requirements.
