The issue is related to the incorrect processing of form data with repeated keys. The function `request_body_to_args` is failing to process form data with repeated keys as expected, leading to the assertion errors in the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly. The function only processes the last key=value pair and discards the previous ones, leading to incorrect validation and unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = []
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) 
                                 and field.shape in sequence_shapes 
                                 and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the form data with repeated keys is correctly processed to create a list of values associated with the same key. This modification would address the issues raised in the failing tests and also satisfy the expected input/output values. Furthermore, it would also resolve the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value in form data.
