The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert a request body into arguments for use in a FastAPI application. It accepts a list of required parameters and the received body as input and is supposed to generate a dictionary of values and a list of errors. 

The cause of the bug is that when a list of items is sent in the request data, the function fails to properly handle it and ends up returning a status code of 422 instead of 200, which causes the corresponding test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the case when multiple values are sent for a single key in the request data, as requested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
                else:
                    value = None
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we iterate through the required parameters and directly access the value for each field using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)`. If the field is in the received body, we obtain the list of values with the given key using `getlist`. Otherwise, we assign `None` to the value. We then proceed to validate the value and handle errors and missing fields accordingly.

With this correction, the function should now handle list data properly and pass the failing test cases while addressing the issue raised in the GitHub ticket.
