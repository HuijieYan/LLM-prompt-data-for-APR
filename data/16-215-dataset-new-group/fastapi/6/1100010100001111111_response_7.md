The cause of the bug is that when the `request_body_to_args` function receives repeated keys in form data, it only processes the last value instead of collecting them all into a list for validation. This behavior does not align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, which requests support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the strategy is to modify the function to collect all repeated keys in form data into a list for validation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if not value and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            elif value:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    value = [await sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                v_, field_errors = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                errors.extend(field_errors)
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- The loop over required fields was simplified to directly process each field.
- The function now checks if a value exists for a field before attempting to validate it.
- If a value exists, the function directly validates it using `field.validate` and collects any errors into the `errors` list.
- If the field has multiple values, such as in the case of repeated keys in form data, the function now collects all values into a list and validates them as a single list.

This correction should align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, providing support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.
