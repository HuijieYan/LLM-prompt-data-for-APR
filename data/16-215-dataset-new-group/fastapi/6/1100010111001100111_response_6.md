Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is related to handling repeated keys in form data. The test cases are sending repeated keys in the form data for items like list, set, and tuple, and the expected behavior is to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation. The function 'request_body_to_args' is failing to collect and handle repeated keys properly, leading to failing tests.

The potential error locations in the buggy function could be in the in the for loop where it checks for 'embed', as well as in the part that handles validation and assignment of the values.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in the form data. It should be collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. The function is failing to do so and instead only considers the last value of the repeated key for validation.

To fix the bug, the 'request_body_to_args' function should be modified to correctly collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation. This can be done by iterating through the form data and collecting the values for repeated keys, and then validating and assigning those collected values as a list to the same key.

Here is the corrected version of the 'request_body_to_args' function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None:
        form_data = received_body  # Assuming that the received_body is a FormData
        values = form_data._dict
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in form_data:
                value = form_data.getlist(field.alias)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we extract the values from the form data for each required parameter. If the parameter is present in the form data, we collect the values for repeated keys using `form_data.getlist` and then validate and assign those collected values as a list to the same key before returning the values and errors.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
