### Bug Analysis:

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting request body data into arguments. It seems to be failing when trying to validate repeated key=value pairs in form data.

The failing tests in `test_forms_from_non_typing_sequences.py` are testing the behavior for python lists, sets, and tuples as form data, but they all fail with a 422 status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

The GitHub issue is related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data and how the validation should work.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the logic for processing repeated keys in form data.
2. Issues with how the validation is done for different types of form data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data, leading to failing validations for Python lists, sets, and tuples in the tests. This causes the tests to fail with a 422 status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the function to properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data.
2. Update the validation process to handle different types of form data correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            # Handle missing values as a list
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            # Perform validation for different types of form data
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
1. The handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data has been revised to properly validate the data.
2. The validation process for different types of form data has been updated.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass with the expected 200 status code.
