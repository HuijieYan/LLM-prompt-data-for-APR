The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is meant to convert a request body into arguments for a FastAPI endpoint. However, there are several potential error locations within the function.

1. There is a mismatch in the check for shape. `field.shape` is used in the condition, but `shape` should be substituted with the actual shapes. 
2. In the section that checks for the type of field (File or not), there are two separate checks for the same condition.
3. The return type `List[ErrorWrapper]` is unclear and might create ambiguity in error handling.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be suggested:
- Verify the shape attribute and provide the correct shapes in the condition.
- Eliminate the repetition in the section that checks for the type of field.
- Replace the return type List[ErrorWrapper] with a more descriptive type or handle the errors inside the function and return a clearer data structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], Union[Dict[str, Any], None]]:
    values = {}
    errors = {}

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in ('sequence', 'tuple', 'list') and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors[field.alias] = "Field is required"
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the errors are now stored in a dictionary, with keys being the field aliases, and the values representing the error message. Additionally, the shape attributes have been replaced with the actual shape values. This should address the issues in the original function and provide a more explicit and cleaner logic for processing the request body.
