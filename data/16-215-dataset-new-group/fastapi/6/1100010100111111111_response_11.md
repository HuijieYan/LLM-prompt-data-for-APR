A strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in the `FormData` object, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the function should correctly check for the presence of the required field and append errors when necessary.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        received_body_dict = received_body.multi_items()
        for field in required_params:
            value: Optional[Any] = None
            if field.alias in received_body_dict:
                received_values = received_body_dict[field.alias]
                if len(received_values) == 1:
                    value = received_values[0]
                else:
                    value = received_values

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `received_body` is first checked to ensure that it is not `None` and is an instance of `FormData`. Then, the `multi_items` method is used to handle repeated keys correctly, allowing them to be properly processed.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values.
