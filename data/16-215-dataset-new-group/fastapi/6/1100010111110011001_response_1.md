The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing it to return a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. This is resulting in failing tests for different data types being sent as form data.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the received form data correctly for lists, sets, and tuples. It is not extracting the values correctly and is also not validating the data types properly.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle these data types correctly and ensure that the validation is performed accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
                else:
                    value = None
                
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function should now be able to pass the failing tests and correctly handle form data for lists, sets, and tuples.
