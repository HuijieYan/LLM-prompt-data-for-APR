The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing to properly handle repeated keys in form data, as indicated by the failing tests and the GitHub issue about supporting repeated key=value in form data.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Improper handling of repeated keys in form data.
2. Incorrect validation mechanism.

The cause of the bug is that when handling form data, the function fails to properly collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. Specifically, when a key appears multiple times in the form data, the values associated with that key should be collected into a list and then processed for validation.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Union[Any, List[Any]] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [v.decode() if isinstance(v, bytes) else v for v in value]
                    if len(value) == 1:
                        value = value[0]
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data and collects the values associated with these keys into a list. It then processes the values for validation.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue about supporting repeated key=value in form data.
