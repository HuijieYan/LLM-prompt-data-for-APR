After analyzing the function, it appears that the potential error locations are in the conditions for processing the body and the validation of the fields.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly processing the received body and is not properly validating the fields, leading to potential errors in populating the values and handling the errors.

To fix the bug, we can use a strategy of ensuring that the received body is processed correctly, and the fields are validated properly before populating the values and handling errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        alias = field.alias
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(alias)
        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and (value == "" or (field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0))
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we iterate through the required_params and process each field in the received body. We've also simplified the processing of the body, removed unnecessary conditions, and updated the validation of the fields. This should resolve the potential errors and provide a corrected function for processing the request body.
