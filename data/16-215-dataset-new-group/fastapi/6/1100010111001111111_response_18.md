Based on the analysis of the `request_body_to_args` function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue lies in handling repeated keys in form data. The function fails to correctly process the input data and convert it into the expected output, causing the tests to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the scenario of receiving multiple values with the same key in form data. This results in incorrect data processing and leads to failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the scenario where form data contains repeated keys. It should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, list) and not isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [value]  # Create a list if the value is not already a list
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and not value)
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the code has been modified to handle repeated keys in form data. It checks if the value is already a list, and if not, it creates a list and assigns the values to it. This resolves the issue of incorrectly processing form data with repeated keys.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values while also resolving the issue posted on GitHub about supporting repeated key=value in form data.
