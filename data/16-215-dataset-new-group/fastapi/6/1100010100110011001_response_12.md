The bug in the provided function is causing the response status code to be 422 instead of the expected 200 in the failing tests. After analyzing the code and the error messages, it is evident that the issue may lie in the validation and handling of form data in the request_body_to_args function.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of sequence shapes and forms in the received_body for the specified fields. This may lead to incorrect validation of the received data and cause the errors in the function.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to thoroughly review the logic for handling different shapes of data in request_body_to_args and ensure that the received data is being considered and validated correctly for different field types and shapes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or value == "":
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function handles the validation and extraction of form data from the request body more accurately, ensuring that different field types and shapes are handled correctly. This updated implementation should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected responses.
