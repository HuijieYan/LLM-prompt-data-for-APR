## Correction
Based on the provided information, it seems that the `request_body_to_args` function is not able to handle repeated key=value pairs in form data as expected. This is causing it to return incorrect values and errors, resulting in failing tests with status code 422 instead of the expected 200.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles repeated keys in form data. The correction should involve modifying the logic to properly handle repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to update the function to account for repeated keys in the form data and process them as a list for sequencing, such as list, set, or tuple. This would involve modifying the logic for extracting values from the form data before validation.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors: List[ErrorWrapper] = []
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is not None:
            values[field.name], error = await field.validate(
                value=received_body.getlist(field.alias, []) if isinstance(field.shape, int) else received_body.get(field.alias),
                values=values,
                loc=("body", field.alias),
            )
            if error:
                errors.append(error)
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version of the function, the `request_body_to_args` function iterates through each field in the `required_params` list and retrieves the corresponding values from the `received_body` using `received_body.getlist` for sequence shapes. It then validates the values and appends any errors to the `errors` list.

Given the corrected version, the function should now be able to handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and return the expected values and errors, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and passing the failing tests with the expected status code of 200.
