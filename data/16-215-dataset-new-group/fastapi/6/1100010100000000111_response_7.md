## Analysis
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for processing required parameters and received body data to extract values and validate them. The function processes the received body to check for required parameters and handle different cases such as sequences, files, and form data.

The GitHub issue suggests that there is an issue with processing repeated keys in form data. The issue requires FastAPI to collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This corresponds to the part of the buggy function that processes form data and checks for repeated keys.

## Potential Error Location
The error may be located in the section of the function where it processes the form data and checks for repeated keys. It seems that the function does not handle repeated keys correctly, resulting in only the last key=value pair being processed.

## Cause of Bug
The bug may be caused by the logic that handles repeated keys in form data. The function may be overwriting the value of keys instead of collecting them as a list as required by the GitHub issue. This leads to only the last key=value pair being processed.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to collect repeated keys in form data and assign their values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This can be achieved by updating the logic in the section that processes form data and checking for repeated keys.

## Corrected Version
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    if field.alias in received_body:  # Check for repeated keys
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks for repeated keys in the received body data and collects their values as a list before validation. This addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensures that repeated keys in form data are processed correctly.
