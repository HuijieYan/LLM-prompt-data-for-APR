The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to the handling of sequence-like types (list, set, tuple) in the received body. When the function encounters a sequence-like type in the received body, it fails to properly process the input and return the correct values, leading to an incorrect status code when used in the test cases.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
- Incorrect handling of sequence-like types in the received body.
- Incorrect value assignment for the received body when `embed` is not present.

The cause of the bug is that the function's logic fails to properly handle and process sequence-like types in the received body, leading to incorrect validation and error generation, resulting in the mismatch of status codes in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle sequence-like types in the received body and ensure that the validation and error generation are based on the correct value types and structures.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle sequence-like types in the received body and correctly validate the input, leading to the correct status codes when used in the test cases.
