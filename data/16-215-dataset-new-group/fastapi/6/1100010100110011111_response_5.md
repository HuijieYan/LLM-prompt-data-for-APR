The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing the failing tests to return a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. The issue is related to handling repeated keys in form data. The function does not handle the case where the form data contains repeated keys, resulting in error messages being appended to the `errors` list, leading to the incorrect status code being returned.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values to a list before validation. This change will resolve the issue with the failing tests and align with the feature request in the corresponding GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = {}
    
    if received_body is not None:
        for param in required_params:
            value = received_body.getlist(param.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(param.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(param, ModelField) and value == ""):
                if param.required:
                    errors[param.alias] = [ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", param.alias))]
                else:
                    values[param.name] = deepcopy(param.default)
            else:
                values[param.name], param_errors = param.validate(value, {}, loc=("body", param.alias))
                if isinstance(param_errors, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors[param.alias] = [param_errors]
                else:
                    errors[param.alias] = param_errors

    return values, list(errors.values())
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the required parameters and use the `getlist` method of `FormData` to handle repeated keys. We also update the `errors` dictionary to store the errors against the parameter alias and then retrieve the values list. This approach allows for handling repeated keys accurately and returning the expected status code during the failing tests.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values while also resolving the GitHub issue related to handling repeated keys in form data.
