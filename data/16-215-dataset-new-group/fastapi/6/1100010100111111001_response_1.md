The bug in the provided function is causing it to return incorrect values and types of variables, leading to failing tests. The function `request_body_to_args` incorrectly processes different types of received bodies, such as lists, sets, and tuples. This causes the function to generate incorrect values for `values` and `errors`, leading to the failing tests.

The error is caused by the way the function processes the different received body types and associates their respective values with the required parameters. Additionally, errors are not being properly handled, leading to incorrect error validation for the required parameters.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle different types of received bodies and associate their respective values with the required parameters. It should also correctly handle and validate any errors that may arise during this process.

Here's the corrected and fixed version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
    ) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        received_body = dict(received_body)

    for field in required_params:
        value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The fixed function correctly handles different types of received bodies and associates their respective values with the required parameters. It also properly handles and validates any errors that may arise during this process.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
