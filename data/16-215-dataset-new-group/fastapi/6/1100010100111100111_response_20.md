The bug in the provided function seems to be caused by the handling of repeated keys in form data, which is not supported in the current implementation. This aligns with the GitHub issue that mentions the need for FastAPI to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

The main potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks and assignments related to handling the values from the received body. It seems that the current implementation does not properly handle repeated keys in form data.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to handle repeated keys and assign the values as a list to the same key before validation, as requested in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function that should address the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Handle repeated keys in form data and assign the values to a list
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                # Handle missing values for required fields
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

This correction should address the bug by correctly handling repeated keys in form data and assigning the values to a list for the same key before validation. This update aligns with the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing tests.
