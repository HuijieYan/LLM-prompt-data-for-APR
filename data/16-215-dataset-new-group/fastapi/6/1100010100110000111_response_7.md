The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data. The current implementation only captures the last key=value pair, while it should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

Potential error locations in the buggy function could be in the section where it processes the `received_body` and extracts values for the fields based on their shapes and types.

The cause of the bug is that when form data contains repeated keys, only the last key=value pair is being captured and handled. This results in the test cases failing with a 422 error (unprocessable entity) instead of returning 200 (OK). The GitHub issue also highlights this problem and suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated keys in form data and assign their values as a list before validation. This can be achieved by checking if a field has multiple values and capturing them as a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # get list of values for a key
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and all(v == '' for v in value))  # check for empty or all-empty values
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if len(value) > 1:  # check if the field has multiple values
                    values[field.name] = value  # assign multiple values as a list
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value[0]  # assign single value
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function checks if a field has multiple values (in the case of repeated keys) and assigns them as a list for validation. This fix addresses the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
