The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the received body data into a dictionary of values and a list of errors based on the required parameters for a request. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could be causing the failure when it encounters non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The cause of the bug could be a combination of issues related to handling non-typing sequences, including incorrect validation of received values, mishandling of fields with sequence shapes, and mishandling of file uploads.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function logic to correctly handle non-typing sequences and validate received values. We also need to address the handling of file uploads to ensure that the function properly processes them.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues related to non-typing sequences and correctly handle file uploads. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
