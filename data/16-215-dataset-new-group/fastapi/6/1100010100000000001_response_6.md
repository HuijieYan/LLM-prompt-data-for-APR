### Analysis of the buggy function:
The `request_body_to_args` function is designed to take a list of required parameters and a received body (either a dictionary or FormData) and return a dictionary of values and a list of errors. It iterates through the required_params and checks the received_body for matching aliases, then performs validation and creates the values and errors lists.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The use of `get_field_info` and `getattr` to retrieve properties from the `field` object may lead to attribute errors.
2. The logic for handling files and sequences seems overly complex and potentially prone to errors.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug may occur due to incorrect handling of field parameters and their corresponding values within the `request_body_to_args` function. This could result in incorrect validation, incomplete values, or errors not being properly appended to the errors list.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic for retrieving and handling field properties.
2. Improve the handling of file and sequence-shaped fields to ensure that the correct values are extracted and validated.
3. Ensure that errors are being appended to the errors list correctly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias) if field.alias in received_body else None

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, (ErrorWrapper, list)):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the logic for retrieving field values from the received_body has been simplified, and the validation and error handling have been improved. Additionally, the file and sequence-shaped field handling has been revised to ensure correct processing.
