Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it seems that the current implementation of the `request_body_to_args` function does not support repeated key=value pairs in form data. Based on the failing tests, the expected return values of the function are not being met. The function should be able to handle the input of repeated key=value pairs and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation. It also seems that the logic to handle multiple values for the same key is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation. We can do this by extracting the logic for handling repeated keys and ensuring they are properly collected and assigned as a list before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, list)  # Ensure value is a list
            ):
                value = [await v.read() for v in value]  # Read all values in the list
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the `required_params` and handle the values for each field. If the value is a list (indicating repeated key=value pairs), we ensure that each value in the list is read and then validate the entire list. This way, the function supports repeated key=value pairs and assigns those values as a list to the same key before validation.

With this correction, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and pass the failing tests.

This correction also aligns with the GitHub issue that requested support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.
