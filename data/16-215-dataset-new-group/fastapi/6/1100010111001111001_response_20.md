In the given buggy function, the function `request_body_to_args` takes a list of required parameters and a received body (either a dictionary or FormData). The function then processes the received body to extract the values for the required parameters and handle errors.

The bug in the function is that it incorrectly processes the received body for list, set, and tuple types. The function fails to handle these non-typing sequences, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly process the data for list, set, and tuple types from the received body. It should handle these cases according to their data types to extract the appropriate values and handle empty or missing data.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    # Process list, set, and tuple types from received body
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (value == "" and field.required) or (value == [] and field.required): 
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the list, set, and tuple types correctly. This should resolve the issues seen in the failing tests.
