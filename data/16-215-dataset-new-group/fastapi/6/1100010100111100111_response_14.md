The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely related to the input parameters, specifically how repeated keys are handled in form data. The bug seems to be causing the function to incorrectly handle repeated keys and their corresponding values, leading to incorrect validation and errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by collecting the values into lists before validation. This would resolve the issue raised in the GitHub discussion about supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                values[field.name], field_errors = field.validate(
                    received_body.getlist(field.alias), values, loc=("body", field.alias)
                )
                if field_errors:
                    errors.extend(field_errors)
    return values, errors
```

In this version, the function iterates through each required parameter and collects the values into lists using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)`. This ensures that repeated keys in form data are correctly handled and validated, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

With this corrected version of the function, the failing tests should now pass, and the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data should be resolved.
