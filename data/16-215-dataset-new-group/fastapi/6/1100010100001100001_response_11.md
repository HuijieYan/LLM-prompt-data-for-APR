The bug in the code appears to be related to the way the `received_body` is handled when it contains multiple values for a single field. In such cases, the code is creating a dictionary with the field alias as the key and the received body as the value, which is causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the received_body contains multiple values for a single field, and then handle it accordingly without overriding the entire received_body.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

                if value is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        if isinstance(value, list):
                            value = list(map(lambda x: x.decode() if isinstance(x, bytes) else x, value))
                    else:
                        if isinstance(value, bytes):
                            value = value.decode()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each field in the `required_params` list and handle the `received_body` according to the field type and shape. We also handle the case where multiple values are received for a single field without overriding the entire received_body.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for different field types and shapes.
