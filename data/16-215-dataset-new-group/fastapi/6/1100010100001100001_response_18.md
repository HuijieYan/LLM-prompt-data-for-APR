The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to how the function handles different field shapes, such as lists, sets, and tuples. In particular, there is an issue when extracting values from the `received_body` and casting them to the expected shape, leading to incorrect validations and possible errors.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to accurately handle the different field shapes and correctly transform the received values to the expected shape before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                    if field.type_ in (list, set, tuple):
                        value = cast(Sequence, value)
                        value = field.type_(value)
            else:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    if field.default is not None:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            if value is not None:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we accurately handle the different shapes of the fields, such as lists, sets, and tuples. We also ensure that the values are transformed into the correct shape before validation. Additionally, we handle the situation when the field has a default value.

This should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly processes the input parameters and returns accurate values.
