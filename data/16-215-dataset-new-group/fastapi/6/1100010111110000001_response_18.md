The bug is in the request_body_to_args function. The function is not handling the input data correctly, which causes the failing tests to receive a status code of 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200.

Upon analyzing the code and the error messages, it appears that the function is unable to parse the input data correctly, leading to errors in validation. The code fails to differentiate between different sequence types, such as lists, sets, and tuples, resulting in incorrect handling of the data and returning the wrong HTTP status code.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the function to properly handle different sequence types (lists, sets, and tuples) and their corresponding data. This includes parsing the input data correctly, validating it, and returning the appropriate values and errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape == "list":
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        elif value is not None:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if field.shape == "list" and all(isinstance(v, str) for v in value) or field.shape == "set":
                    values[field.name] = set(value)
                elif field.shape == "tuple" and all(isinstance(v, str) for v in value):
                    values[field.name] = tuple(value)
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))  # Incorrect sequence shape
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we handle specific sequence shapes (list, set, and tuple) and their corresponding data. We validate the data based on the sequence shape and properly handle file types and bytes. This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.

With the corrected function, the failing tests should now pass and return the expected HTTP status code of 200.
