## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The condition to check if the field is a sequence shape and the received body is a FormData instance might not be correctly handling repeated keys.

2. The `value` might not be correctly assigned when handling repeated keys in the FormData instance.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the GitHub Issue information

The buggy function is not handling repeated keys correctly when the received body is a FormData instance. This is leading to only the last key=value pair being captured, which doesn't work as expected when trying to validate against multiple values for the same key.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy to fix the bug would involve modifying the logic for handling repeated keys in the FormData instance. The function should handle repeated keys and assign the values to a list for the same key before validation occurs.

## Provide a corrected version of the function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Use getlist to handle repeated keys
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [await v.read() if isinstance(v, UploadFile) else v for v in value]
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                            )
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now uses `getlist()` method to handle repeated keys in the FormData instance and assigns the values to a list. It also correctly handles the validation for bytes type and list values for repeated keys. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
