The bug in the function `request_body_to_args` is that it does not handle sequence types properly for the `value` when received as `FormData` in different cases, resulting in incorrect type conversions and value assignments.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles different sequence types (such as list, set, and tuple) when received as `FormData` and properly converts them to the desired types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                else:
                    value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have removed unnecessary code and made sure that the sequence types are properly handled when received as `FormData`. We are also properly assigning the converted values to the `values` dictionary and handling any errors that may occur.

This should fix the bug and make the function work correctly for different types of sequences received as `FormData`.
