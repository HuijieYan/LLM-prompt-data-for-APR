The issue in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data. The function appears to incorrectly handle the case where the form data contains a list of values for a single key. This is causing the failing tests `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`. The failing tests are related to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data", which requests support for the validation and handling of repeated keys in form data.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where the form data contains a list of values for a single key, and ensure that the validation can process the repeated key-value pairs appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function to resolve the issue and pass the failing tests:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body and isinstance(received_body[field.alias], list):
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
                    else:
                        value = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and isinstance(value, list) and all(v == "" for v in value))
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            if (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
            ):
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
                else:
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape]([value])
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function, the handling of repeated keys in form data has been updated to correctly process the list of values for a single key. Additionally, the validation has been adjusted to support the repeated key-value pairs in form data.

This updated function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
