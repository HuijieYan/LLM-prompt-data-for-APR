The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is used to convert the request body into arguments for a FastAPI API endpoint. It processes required parameters and handles various input validation and conversion. However, based on the failing test functions and the GitHub issue, it seems that the current implementation does not properly handle repeated keys in form data, such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The potential cause of the bug is that the `request_body_to_args` function does not correctly handle repeated keys in form data. It appears to process the form data in a way that only the last value for a key is considered, rather than collecting all the values for that key into a list.

To fix this bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys in form data and collect them into lists, sets, or tuples as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

                if value and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = cast(Sequence, value)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the `required_params` and check if the field alias exists in the received body. If it does, we handle the repeated keys correctly by checking if the shape of the field is a sequence. If so, we cast the value to a sequence and validate it accordingly. If the alias is not found and the field is required, we add a MissingError to the errors list.

With this correction, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly handle repeated keys in form data, such as lists, sets, and tuples, and validate them as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test functions pass.
