To address the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to correct the processing of different data structures, such as lists, sets, and tuples. The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of these data structures when passed as request parameters.

Based on the failing tests provided and the error messages, it seems that the function is returning a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. This indicates a validation error in the `request_body_to_args` function, likely caused by incorrect processing of the received data.

The bug is likely caused by the handling of non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function may not be correctly extracting and validating these sequences from the request body, leading to validation errors and the wrong status code being returned.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for processing non-typing sequences in the `request_body_to_args` function and ensure that the values are correctly extracted, validated, and handled according to the specified field requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]
                if isinstance(field.type_, (list, set, tuple)) and not isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple)):
                    value = [value]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the `required_params` and check if the `field.alias` is present in the `received_body`. If it is, we validate the value and add it to the `values` dictionary. If the field is required and not present in the `received_body`, a `MissingError` is added to the `errors` list. Finally, the `values` and `errors` are returned as a tuple.

This fixes the bug in the function by correctly handling non-typing sequences and ensuring that the request parameters are validated and processed according to the specified field requirements.
