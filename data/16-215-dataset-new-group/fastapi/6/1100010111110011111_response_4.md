The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to process incoming request data and validate the values against a list of required parameters. However, it fails to handle repeated key-value pairs in form data, which is causing the failing tests. 

The key problem lies in the `request_body_to_args` function's inability to properly process repeated key-value pairs in form data, resulting in validation errors and returning the wrong status code. This is consistent with the issue reported on GitHub, which aims to add support for repeated key-value pairs in form data.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the lack of support for repeated key-value pairs in the `request_body_to_args` function. Specifically, the function fails to properly process repeated keys when parsing form data, leading to incomplete processing of the input value and incorrect validation results.

To fix the bug, a strategy is proposed:
1. Modify the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly process repeated key-value pairs in form data by collecting all values for the same key and assigning them to a list before validation.

Based on these steps, the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function is provided below:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected function, the tests that previously failed should now pass, and the function should be able to handle repeated key-value pairs in form data properly. This aligns with the request made in the GitHub issue to add support for repeated key-value pairs in form data.
