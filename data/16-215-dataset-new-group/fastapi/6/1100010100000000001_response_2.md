## Analysis of the buggy function:

The function `request_body_to_args` takes a list of required parameters and a received body as input and is supposed to convert the received body into a dictionary of values and a list of errors. However, there are several potential error locations in the function, including type checking, conditional logic, and error handling.

## Potential error locations:
1. Incorrectly handling the `received_body` when it's a single value and not a dictionary.
2. Incorrectly handling the value of required parameters.
3. Error handling when a field is missing or required.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the received body and required parameters, as well as the error handling logic when a required parameter is missing.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check and handle the case where the `received_body` is a single value and not a dictionary.
2. Ensure that the required parameters are checked and handled correctly to avoid any missing values.
3. Improve the error handling logic to correctly handle missing or required fields.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
