The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to the processing of repeated keys in form data, as indicated in the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data." The function fails to handle repeated keys, leading to incorrect behavior and test failures.

Based on the failing tests and the expected input/output values, it seems that the function is not correctly processing form data with repeated keys. The function should be able to handle cases where a single key corresponds to multiple values, such as `items: ["first", "second", "third"]`.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function should be updated to correctly handle the processing of repeated keys in form data. Specifically, it should handle cases where a single key corresponds to multiple values, such as converting them into a list.

Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the updated version of the function, the conditional checks and value assignment have been adjusted to correctly handle the processing of repeated keys in form data, as requested in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `request_body_to_args` function should now be able to handle repeated keys in form data and pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
