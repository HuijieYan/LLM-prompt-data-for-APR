## Fixing the bug
Looking at the buggy function `request_body_to_args` and the failing tests, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The failing tests involve sending a list, set, or tuple as form data, and the function does not seem to handle these cases correctly.

To fix the bug, we will need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and correctly convert them into lists, sets, or tuples as specified in the failing tests. This will involve checking if a field is a sequence shape and processing the form data accordingly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                else:
                    value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary checking of the `embed` attribute and focused on properly handling the form data based on the field shape. This should address the issue with handling repeated keys in form data.

After applying this correction, the failing test cases should now pass as the function is now able to correctly handle form data with lists, sets, and tuples.
