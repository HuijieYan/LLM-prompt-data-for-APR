The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert the received body from a request into a dictionary of values and a list of errors based on the required parameters. However, it contains multiple issues that result in incorrect behavior when dealing with non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Incorrect handling of non-typing sequences in the `received_body` when converting them into a dictionary.
2. Improper validation and conversion of non-typing sequences into the expected format.

The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling and conversion of non-typing sequences, leading to incorrect values and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the function to properly handle non-typing sequences and ensure that the values are validated and converted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is not None and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, set, tuple)):
            value = cast(Union[List, Set, Tuple], value)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
1. The function now correctly handles non-typing sequences by checking the type and casting the value if necessary.
2. The validation and conversion of values are done in separate branches to ensure correct handling for each case.

These changes should address the issues and make the function correctly handle non-typing sequences when converting the received body into values and errors.
