The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function causes incorrect handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data, resulting in failing tests for list, set, and tuple types. The examples provided show that the function does not correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data and is unable to validate them when required.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated key-value pairs in form data as expected, resulting in incorrect values and causing the tests to fail. This behavior is not aligned with the expected functionality and is reported in the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data."

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in form data and validate them accordingly.

Given the information and analysis provided, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function resolves the issue by correctly handling repeated key-value pairs in form data and validating them according to the requirements. This should ensure that the failing tests for list, set, and tuple types pass as expected.
