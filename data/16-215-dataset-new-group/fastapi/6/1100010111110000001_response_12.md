The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to convert a request body to arguments, based on a list of required parameters and the received body. It seems to be used to extract parameters from requests in FastAPI.

The error message indicates that the failing tests are expecting a status code of 200, but receiving status code 422. This suggests that the request body is not being processed correctly.

Potential errors in the `request_body_to_args` function:
1. The way the `value` is handled to extract the value from the received body.
2. The default values for parameters in case of missing or empty values might not be processed correctly.
3. The validation logic for the received values might not be working correctly.

The possible cause of the bug is likely that the function is not extracting the values from the received body in the expected format. Additionally, the logic for handling missing or empty values is likely causing unexpected behavior, leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function should be thoroughly reviewed and tested against known cases, particularly involving list, set, and tuple parameters as form data. The extraction and validation logic should be verified and updated as needed.

Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            elif value is None:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This version should pass the failing tests related to list, set, and tuple parameters as form data. However, it's important to thoroughly test the function against other cases to ensure it handles all types of input correctly.
