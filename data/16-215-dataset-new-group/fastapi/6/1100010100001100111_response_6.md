The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to how it handles the case when there are multiple values for the same key in the FormData. The issue on GitHub suggests that the current behavior of FastAPI is problematic when there are repeated key=value pairs in form data, and it proposes a solution where FastAPI collects repeated keys and assigns their values as a list before validation.

Based on the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it's clear that the function is not handling the case of repeated keys in the FormData correctly. The `request_body_to_args` function should properly handle multiple values for the same key in the FormData and assign those values as a list before validation.

One potential strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the function to check for and handle repeated keys in the FormData. If a key has multiple values in the FormData, it should create a list of those values and assign it to the key before continuing with the validation process.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                # Check for repeated keys in the FormData
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values_dict = received_body.multi_items()
                    for key, val in values_dict:
                        if key == field.alias:
                            value = [v[1] for v in val]  # Create a list of values for the key
            if value is None:  # If there was no repeated key, get the value as before
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            # The rest of the function remains unchanged
            # ...

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we check for repeated keys in the FormData and create a list of values for the key if it has multiple values. This aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue and should address the bug.
