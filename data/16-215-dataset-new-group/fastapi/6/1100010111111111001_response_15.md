Based on the given buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that there is an issue with the `request_body_to_args` function. The bug appears to be in the code that is attempting to handle different types of sequences ('list', 'set', 'tuple') for the `items` field, and the function is not able to validate them properly. As a result, the defined types for these fields are not being handled correctly, and the function is returning incorrect values.

To correctly fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the different types of sequences and validate the received data.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now iterates over the `required_params` list to properly handle the different types of sequences and validate the received data. This should resolve the issue with the failing tests.

The corrected function should now pass the given failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
