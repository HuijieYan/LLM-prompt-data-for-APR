The cause of the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is that it is not properly handling the case of form data containing a list, set, or tuple.

The issue is related to how the function processes each item in the form data. It seems that the function does not handle non-typing sequences (e.g., lists, sets, tuples) correctly and hence returns a 422 status code which is an HTTP status code for "Unprocessable Entity", indicating that while the server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct, the server was unable to process the contained instructions.

The fix for this bug involves updating the logic that processes the form data containing non-typing sequences to correctly extract and validate the values.

The corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args` is as follows:
```python
import asyncio
from copy import deepcopy
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple, Union
from pydantic import ErrorWrapper, FormData, MissingError
from pydantic.fields import Field as ModelField
from fastapi import Request

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    request: Request
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    received_body = await request.form()
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                # check for non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple)
                if field.sub_fields:
                    value_items = value if isinstance(value, list) else [value]
                    processed_items = []
                    for item in value_items:
                        item_values, item_errors = await request_body_to_args(field.sub_fields, item)
                        processed_items.append(item_values)
                        errors.extend(item_errors)
                    values[field.name] = processed_items if isinstance(value, list) else processed_items[0]
                else:
                    # validate the field and handle missing values
                    try:
                        validated_value = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        values[field.name], validation_errors = validated_value
                        if isinstance(validation_errors, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(validation_errors)
                        elif isinstance(validation_errors, list):
                            errors.extend(validation_errors)
                    except Exception as e:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(e, loc=("body", field.alias)))
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        elif field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version:
- The function now accepts a request object instead of body data directly.
- We are extracting form data from the request using `await request.form()`.
- The function now correctly handles the scenario where the form data contains non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) and recursively calls `request_body_to_args` to process the subfields. If the field has sub-fields, it processes each item in the non-typing sequence and collects the processed items into a list that is assigned to the field.
- It properly validates the field values and handles missing values. If a value is missing and the field is required, it appends a `MissingError` to the errors list.
- Finally, it returns the values and any errors encountered during processing.

This should fix the bug and allow the function to correctly process form data containing non-typing sequences. The corrected function should pass the failing tests.
