The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to how it processes repeated keys in form data. The function is not correctly handling the case where the same key appears multiple times in the form data, which is an issue reported on GitHub.

The potential error location seems to be the section where the function processes the `received_body` to extract values for the required parameters. Specifically, the code that checks for `sequence_shapes` and processes the data seems to be where the issue lies.

The cause of the bug is that when the same key appears multiple times in the `FormData`, the function is not correctly creating a list of values for that key. Instead, it's only capturing the last value for that key. This behavior contradicts the expected functionality outlined in the GitHub issue, where repeated keys in form data should be collected into a list for validation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. When the function encounters a repeated key, it should aggregate all the values for that key into a list and then use that list during validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        # Group the values of the same key into a list
        grouped_data = {}
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            grouped_data.setdefault(key, []).append(value)

        for field in required_params:
            value = grouped_data.get(field.alias)  # Get the list of values for the field
            if value is not None:
                # Use the list of values for validation
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                error_loc = ("body", field.alias)
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=error_loc))
                else:  
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=error_loc, config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `received_body` is a `FormData`. If it is, we then group the values of the same key into a list. Then, in the loop over the `required_params`, we get the list of values for each field and use that list for validation. If the values are missing for a required field, we append an error to the `errors` list.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and handle repeated keys in form data appropriately.
