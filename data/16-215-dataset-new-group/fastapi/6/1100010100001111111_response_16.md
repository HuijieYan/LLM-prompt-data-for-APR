Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data. The function `request_body_to_args` is not processing the repeated keys correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the handling of repeated keys in the `received_body` when processing form data. The function only considers the last value for a repeated key, which is not in line with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle repeated key-value pairs in the form data and ensure that all values are captured and passed for validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if values[field.name] is None or values[field.name] == "":
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                
                # Handle file upload case
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(values[field.name], list):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in values[field.name]]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        values[field.name] = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    elif isinstance(values[field.name], UploadFile):
                        values[field.name] = await values[field.name].read()
                    
                # Validate the value
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each field in the `required_params` list and properly handle retrieving the values from the `received_body`, including capturing repeated key-value pairs. We also handle the file upload case and properly validate the values against the field requirements.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and handle the expected input/output values for the test cases.
