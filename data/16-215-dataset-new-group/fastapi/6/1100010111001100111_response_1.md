The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function appears to be related to the handling of repeated keys in the `FormData`. Specifically, when multiple values are sent with the same key, the function only considers the last value for validation, as described in the GitHub issue.

Upon analyzing the failing test cases and the runtime values of the variables within the function, it is evident that the `request_body_to_args` function fails to handle repeated keys in the form data correctly. This bug results in the values not being collected as a list, as expected by the calling code.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data and collect their values as a list for validation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    # Group values by key, if repeated
    grouped_values = {}
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if value:
                grouped_values[field.alias] = value

    for field in required_params:
        value = grouped_values.get(field.alias)

        # Validation and error handling
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function groups the values by key if repeated in the `FormData` and collects them as a list, which is then used for validation. This approach aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue, ensuring that repeated keys are handled correctly.

By using this corrected version, the failing tests should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
