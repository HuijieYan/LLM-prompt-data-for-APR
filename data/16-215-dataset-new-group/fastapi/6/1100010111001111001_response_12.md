To fix the buggy function, we need to correct the logic for creating and formatting the values and errors correctly. Based on the provided code and the failing test cases, I suggest the following strategy to fix the bug:

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if the provided required_params list is empty or not. If it is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary for values and an empty list for errors.
2. If the list is not empty, iterate through each field in the required_params list and handle the creation of the value and any associated errors based on the received_body input and the field type and requirements.
3. For the received_body, if it is a FormData and the field shape requires a sequence (list, set, or tuple), handle the respective formatting.

### Corrected version of the function
Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if not required_params:
        return values, errors

    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        field_name = field.alias
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            if field.shape == 1:
                value = received_body.getlist(field_name)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field_name)
        else:
            value = received_body.get(field_name)

        if value is None or (isinstance(field, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field_name)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field_name))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now handle the creation of values and errors based on the received body and the field requirements correctly, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.

Please test the corrected function with the provided failing test cases to ensure that it now passes them.
