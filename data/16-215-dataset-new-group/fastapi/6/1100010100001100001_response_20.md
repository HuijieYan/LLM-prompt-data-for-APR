The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to take a list of required parameters and a received body as input, then extract the values from the body based on the parameters and return them.

The potential errors in the function are related to how it handles the received body and extracts the values based on the required parameters.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the function not correctly handling the received body when extracting values based on the required parameters. This can lead to incorrect values being assigned to the `values` dictionary or unnecessary errors being added to the `errors` list.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately extract values from the received body based on the required parameters and handle them correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    # Iterate over the required parameters
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        # Check if the received body is not None and is of type FormData
        if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            # Extract the value from the received body based on the field's alias
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        # Validate the value against the field and handle errors
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates over the required parameters and extracts the value from the received body based on each parameter's alias. It then validates the value against the field and handles any errors appropriately. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function accurately extracts values based on the required parameters.
