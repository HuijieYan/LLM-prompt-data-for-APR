The buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be failing when trying to validate and extract values from the received body. The failing tests are related to posting data in different form formats like a list, set, and tuple, and expecting a 200 status code in response, which currently causes assertion errors.

After analyzing the function and the failing test, it appears that the function is not handling the form data correctly and may be encountering errors during value extraction.

The potential errors in the function could be related to:
1. Incorrect extraction of values from received body (FormData).
2. Incorrect validation of the extracted values.
3. Handling sequences like lists, sets, and tuples.

The cause of the bug is that the function is unable to correctly extract values from the received form data and validate them, resulting in errors and failing the tests with a 422 status code rather than the expected 200 status code.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` should be modified to properly extract and validate the values received in the form data. The handling of sequences like lists, sets, and tuples should also be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}  # Create an empty dict if the body is None
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if field.alias in received_body:  # Check if the field is present in the received_body
            value = received_body[field.alias]
            
            if isinstance(value, list) and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                # If it's a list and it matches the sequence shape, then assign the value
                values[field.name] = value
            elif isinstance(value, (set, tuple)) and field.shape == "tuple":
                # If it's a set or tuple and it matches the tuple shape, then assign the value
                values[field.name] = value
            else:
                # For other cases, use the default behavior
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            if field.required:
                # If the field is required and not present in the body, add MissingError to errors
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
            else:
                # If the field is not required and not present, assign the field's default value
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

The corrected function now handles the form data correctly and validates the extracted values based on the field definition. The function should work as expected and pass the failing tests.
