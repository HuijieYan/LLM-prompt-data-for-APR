Based on the runtime input/output values and the failing tests, we can see that the `request_body_to_args` function is not correctly handling the input body for lists, sets, and tuples. The logic inside the function does not account for non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when converting them from form data.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are primarily in the conditional logic that handles different field shapes and types.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly interprets non-typing sequence shapes for form data fields, leading to incorrect conversions and validation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle non-typing sequences when converting form data to arguments.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            elif value is None and not field.required:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through each field in the required_params and correctly handles the conversion and validation of non-typing sequence shapes for form data fields.

With this corrected version, the failing tests should pass as the function will now handle non-typing sequences correctly.
