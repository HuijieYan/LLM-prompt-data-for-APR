To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to update the logic for handling non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples in the `received_body`. The bug currently causes incorrect validation of these non-typing sequences, leading to failed tests.

The issue stems from the incorrect handling of non-typing sequences, leading to improper validation and generation of values and errors.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the logic for handling non-typing sequences (lists, sets, and tuples) to correctly extract the values and perform the required validation based on the field type and input.
2. Update the logic for validating and generating values and errors based on the received data and the field information.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the logic for extracting values from non-typing sequences (lists, sets, tuples) has been updated to correctly handle the received data and perform the required validation based on the field type and input.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values for the given cases.
