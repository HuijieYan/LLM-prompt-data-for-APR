The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function involves the parsing of repeated keys in form data. The function is supposed to handle repeated keys and convert them into a list, set, or tuple, depending on the specified type in the `required_params`. However, the function does not properly handle repeated keys and their values, leading to incorrect parsing and validation.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the handling of repeated keys within the `received_body`. The function should properly handle repeated keys and their values to create the appropriate data structure (list, set, tuple) for validation. Additionally, the validation of the field's value should account for the possibility of repeated keys and handle them accordingly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle repeated keys within the form data and convert them into the expected data structure (list, set, or tuple) based on the specified type in the `required_params`. The validation process should also account for the presence of repeated keys and handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function properly checks for repeated keys and handles them by getting all the values associated with the key as a list. It then proceeds to validate the field's value and append any errors to the `errors` list. This approach ensures that the function correctly handles the parsing of repeated keys in form data and converts them into the appropriate data structure for validation.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data and aligns the behavior with the expected functionality of the `request_body_to_args` function in FastAPI.
