The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is caused by how it handles different sequence types in the `received_body`. When processing parameters with types like `list`, `set`, and `tuple`, the function fails to correctly convert the received body values. This results in incorrect validations and error responses, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the different sequence types and perform the necessary conversions based on the parameter types. Additionally, it should ensure that the received body is processed accurately for each parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly processes the `received_body` values based on the field types and shapes, ensuring that the sequence types are handled appropriately. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing tests.
