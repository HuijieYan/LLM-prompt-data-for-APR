The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing errors when processing form data in the request. The issue is related to the handling of non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is failing to properly extract values from the received form data and validate them against the required parameters.

The potential error locations within the function:
1. Incorrect extraction of values from the received form data.
2. Improper validation of the extracted values against required parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling non-typing sequences when extracting and validating values from the form data. This is resulting in errors and failed validation checks.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when extracting and validating form data.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is None:
        return values, errors

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if field.shape in (List, Set, Tuple) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
        else:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in (List, Set, Tuple) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            try:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            except Exception as e:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(e, loc=('body', field.alias)))
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles non-typing sequences by checking for the type of the field shape and retrieving the corresponding form data. It also ensures proper validation and error handling for the extracted values.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided cases.
