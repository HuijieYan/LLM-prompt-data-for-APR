It seems that the issue is with the processing of the FormData received in the `received_body` parameter of the `request_body_to_args` function. The function is not handling collections (list, set, tuple) correctly when it receives a FormData as the body.

To fix this issue:
- We need to handle the collections separately when received in FormData.
- We also need to have specific validation for lists, sets, and tuples when extracted from FormData.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        # Coerce FormData to a regular dict to handle it uniformly
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            received_body = dict(received_body)

        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                # Handling special cases for processing collections from FormData
                if field.type_ == list:
                    if not isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [value]
                elif field.type_ == set:
                    value = set([value])
                elif field.type_ == tuple:
                    value = (value,)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have added specific handling for lists, sets, and tuples extracted from the FormData, and we are also converting the FormData to a regular dictionary for uniform processing. With this correction, the `request_body_to_args` function should be able to handle collections from FormData correctly.
