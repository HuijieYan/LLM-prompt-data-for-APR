The issue lies within the `request_body_to_args` function in the `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py` file. It is causing a `422` error instead of the expected `200` status code when the request is made with a list, set, or tuple param as form data.

The bug is occurring because the `request_body_to_args` function is not properly handling form data when it contains non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, or tuples.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function's logic to correctly handle non-typing sequences when parsing form data.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None:
                    value = received_body.get(field.name)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we have removed some redundant conditional checks and correctly assigned the value of the field by checking its shape in the if condition and assigning `value` to the correct field name. This fix should resolve the issue causing the failing tests.
