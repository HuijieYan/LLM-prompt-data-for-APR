The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to how it handles repeated keys in the FormData while validating the values. The issue mentioned on GitHub is related to the same problem, indicating that the function doesn't collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation, as expected.

The bug is likely occurring when the function iterates over the `required_params` and handles the value retrieval from the `received_body` object, specifically when the field shape is in sequence_shapes and the received_body is an instance of FormData.

To fix the bug, you should update the function to handle repeated keys in the FormData and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for handling repeated keys when the field shape is in sequence_shapes and the received_body is an instance of FormData.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # If the field's alias is in the received_body, build a list
                    # with the value(s) for that alias
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            # Other validation and processing remains unchanged...
            # ...
            
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, when the field's shape is in sequence_shapes and the `received_body` is an instance of FormData, we specifically handle the case of repeated keys by using `getlist` to retrieve all the values for that key as a list.

This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub and fix the bug in the function.
