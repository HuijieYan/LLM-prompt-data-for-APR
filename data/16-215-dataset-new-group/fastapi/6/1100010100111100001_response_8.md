Based on the failing tests and the runtime input/output variable values, the bug appears to be related to the handling of sequence types (list, set, tuple) in the `request_body_to_args` function.

In the first case, when a list is passed as a field in the form data, the values get extracted as a list type in the `values` dictionary. Similarly, in the second case, a set is passed as a field, but it's wrongly being considered as a list type in the `values` dictionary. In the third case, a tuple is passed, and the values are extracted as a tuple type in the `values` dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling different sequence types (list, set, tuple) when they are passed as form data.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the different sequence types and ensure that the extracted values are stored in the `values` dictionary with the correct type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None and isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple)):
                    value = type(field.type_)(value)  # Convert to the correct type
            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected conversion logic for different sequence types, the function should now handle form data with list, set, and tuple fields appropriately and store them in the `values` dictionary with the correct type. This should address the failing tests.
