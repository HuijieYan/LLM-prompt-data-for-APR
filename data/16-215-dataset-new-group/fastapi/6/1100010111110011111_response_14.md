To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. The issues reported in the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the form data as expected.
The failing test expected the status code 200, but received the status code 422, indicating a validation error. This error occurs due to incorrect handling of repeated keys in form data.
The expected behavior is to collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value

    return values, errors
```
In the corrected function, we loop through each field in the required_params and extract the corresponding values from the received_body. We handle repeated keys in form data correctly by using `received_body.getlist()` to obtain a list of values for a key if it exists. We then set the value for each field in the `values` dictionary. If a value is missing or empty, we add an error to the `errors` list or use the field's default value, if available.

This fixed function should now handle repeated keys in the form data correctly and resolve the issues reported in the failing test cases.
