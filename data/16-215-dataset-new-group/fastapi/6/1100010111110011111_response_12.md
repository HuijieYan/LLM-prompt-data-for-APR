Based on the failing test cases and GitHub issue, the bug seems to arise from the function `request_body_to_args()` failing to support repeated keys in form data, such as a Python list, set, or tuple. This is leading to an incorrect status code in the responses and wrong assertion values in the tests.

The cause of the bug is that when the received body data contains repeated keys, only the last key=value pair is considered, and the others are ignored. This leads to incorrect validation behavior and the wrong status code in the responses.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args()` needs to be modified to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. It should update the values with the correct keys instead of replacing them, enabling support for Python lists, sets, and tuples.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.alias in received_body:  # check if the alias exists in the received body
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:  # handle repeated keys
                        values[field.name] = value
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = value[-1] if isinstance(value, list) else value  # handle non-repeated keys
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function specifically checks for repeated keys in the received body data and correctly updates the values for the corresponding keys, allowing support for Python lists, sets, and tuples.

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved, as the corrected function now supports repeated key=value pairs in form data.
