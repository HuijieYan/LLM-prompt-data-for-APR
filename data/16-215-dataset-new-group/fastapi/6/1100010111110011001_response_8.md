The cause of the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is that it fails to handle the conversion of input data into the expected data types. This results in incorrect handling of different types of input data (i.e., lists, sets, tuples), leading to a failure to validate the data and providing incorrect error messages.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle different types of input data and perform data validation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    # Iterate through each required parameter and perform data validation
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None

        if received_body is not None:
            # Get the value from the received body based on the field alias
            if field.name in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.name]

        # Perform validation and handle errors
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this corrected function, it should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values you have provided.
