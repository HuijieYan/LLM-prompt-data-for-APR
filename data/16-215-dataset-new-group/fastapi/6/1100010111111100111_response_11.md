## Correction:

The buggy function is not handling multiple values for the same key in the `FormData` correctly. It should support collecting repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation. The issue on GitHub also suggests a similar approach.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to handle repeated keys in `FormData`. It should collect repeated keys in a list and assign those values to the same key before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}

    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle repeated keys in `FormData`. It will collect the values for the same key into a list, which can then be validated and returned as expected.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also ensure that the failing test cases pass.
