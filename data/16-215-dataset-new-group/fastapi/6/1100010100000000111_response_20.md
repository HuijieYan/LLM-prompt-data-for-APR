The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has potential errors in handling repeated key=value pairs in form data. The GitHub issue indicates that it is currently not possible to validate repeated key=value pairs using FastAPI's `Form` parameter.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated key=value pairs properly. It only captures the last value for a given key in the form data, instead of creating a list of values for a repeated key.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to collect all values for a repeated key in a list before validation. We should also update the function to handle repeated key=value pairs in the form data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        received_data = received_body.multi_items()
        form_data = {k: v for k, v in received_data}
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in form_data:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    values[field.name] = form_data.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = form_data.get(field.alias)
                    if (
                        values[field.name] is None
                        and field.required
                        and not field.validate_not_required
                    ):
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we handle the form data as a dictionary and check for repeated key=value pairs using the `multi_items()` method. We then store the values for each key as a list if it is a repeated key, and handle required fields by validating their presence in the form data.

This should address the issue reported in GitHub and correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in the form data.
