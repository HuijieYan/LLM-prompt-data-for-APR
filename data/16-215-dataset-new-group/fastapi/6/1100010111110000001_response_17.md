The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is used to convert received form data to Python types, according to the required_params list, and is expected to return a tuple of parsed values and any validation errors. The failing tests are due to the fact that the function is not correctly parsing the form data, and is returning a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200 for each test case.

I'm going to examine the function `request_body_to_args` to identify and fix potential errors that could be causing the failing tests.

In the buggy function `request_body_to_args`, there are several potential error locations:
1. The way the 'received_body' is being processed and transformed into 'values' and 'errors'.
2. The conditions used to construct 'values' and 'errors', including how missing values are being handled.
3. Whether the form data is being correctly parsed from 'received_body'.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect processing of the 'received_body' form data, leading to the wrong status code being returned.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve thoroughly reviewing the processing logic within the function, ensuring that form data is correctly parsed, and that required form parameters are being handled appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.alias] = value
    return values, errors
```

The corrected function focuses on handling the received form data correctly, parsing the values into the 'values' dictionary, and processing any missing or invalid fields. This should address the failing tests and ensure that the correct status codes are returned.
