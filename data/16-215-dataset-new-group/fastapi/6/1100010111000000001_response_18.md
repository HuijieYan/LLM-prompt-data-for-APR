The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert the received request body into a dictionary of values and a list of validation errors. The code iterates through the list of required parameters and extracts the corresponding values from the received body. It then validates the values and populates the `values` dictionary or the `errors` list accordingly.

The potential error locations within the function are related to the extraction and validation of the values from the received body, as well as the conditions for populating the `values` dictionary and the `errors` list.

The cause of the bug when handling non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples is that the function fails to properly handle these cases, resulting in incorrect behavior and validation errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle non-typing sequences and perform proper validation for these cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    elif isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The corrected function now properly handles non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples, and performs the necessary validation to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate results and errors.
