The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not handling repeated keys correctly and is failing to convert form data into the expected Python list, set, or tuple. This results in assertion errors in the provided test cases. The `request_body_to_args` function needs to be fixed so that it handles repeated keys appropriately and converts form data to the expected Python data structure.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys correctly. When there are repeated keys in the form data, the function only considers the last value of the key, leading to incorrect conversions and validation failures.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys, convert the form data to the expected Python data structure, and perform proper validation according to the GitHub issue. It should also address the validation errors and missing values.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is not None:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if not value:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the `request_body_to_args` function should be able to correctly handle repeated keys and convert form data into the expected Python list, set, or tuple. This should resolve the issues identified in the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, as well as address the GitHub issue by correctly collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list for validation.
