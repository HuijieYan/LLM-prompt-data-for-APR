Based on the given context, the buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly, as indicated by the failing tests and the associated GitHub issue. The error message shows that the expected status code of 200 is not being returned, resulting in a status code of 422. This is occurring because the function is not correctly handling form data with repeated keys, causing the validation to fail.

The bug is likely caused by the loop in the function that handles checking for the presence of `FormData` and then processing the field values. The loop should be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function should be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data, and the values should be processed into a list for validation. This should align with the expected behavior from the FastAPI framework and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.

Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    # Process each field in the required parameters list
    for field in required_params:
        field_name = field.alias
        value = None

        # Process multiple values for the same key
        if isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field_name)
            continue

        # Process single value for the key
        value = received_body.get(field_name)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        # Validate the value
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, when processing form data, we check if the field is a `FormData`, and if so, we use `getlist` to retrieve a list of values for that key. This ensures that multiple values are processed correctly and stored in a list. This change should resolve the issue and make the function handle repeated keys in form data as expected.

By applying this corrected function, the failing tests should pass, and the function should provide the expected behavior when handling repeated keys in form data, as requested in the GitHub issue.
