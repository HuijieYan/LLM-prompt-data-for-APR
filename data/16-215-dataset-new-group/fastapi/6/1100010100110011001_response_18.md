The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to take a list of required parameters and an optional received body, and then extract values from the received body that correspond to the required parameters, validating each value and returning any errors.

The cause of the bug is due to the function incorrectly handling non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples. It fails to extract the values correctly for these non-typing sequences when they are provided in the received body, which results in the function returning a 422 status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

The bug can be fixed by updating the implementation to correctly handle non-typing sequences and extract the values from the received body for these sequences.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates over each required parameter, extracts the value from the received body based on the field's shape, and then validates the value. This updated implementation ensures that the values for non-typing sequences are extracted correctly, and the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
