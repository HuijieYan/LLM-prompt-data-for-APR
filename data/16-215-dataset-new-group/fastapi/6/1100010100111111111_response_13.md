A potential issue with the `request_body_to_args` function is that it does not handle repeated keys in form data as expected. This could be the cause of the failing tests, where the status code is expected to be 200 but returns 422 instead. The GitHub issue also supports this, stating that the `request_body_to_args` function should collect repeated keys in a 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle repeated keys in form data and ensure that the values are collected as a list. We need to update the function to handle the expected behavior of collecting repeated keys' values into a list before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                        if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                        else:
                            value = await value.read()
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we've removed the logic to handle repeated keys and included a new process to handle values as lists from form data. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function handles the expected behavior of collecting repeated keys' values as lists before validation.

This should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub related to the behavior of form data processing.
