The buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be incorrectly handling different types of fields. It is not correctly converting the received body data to the appropriate types based on the field types.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Incorrectly handling different field shapes (list, set, tuple).
2. Incorrectly validating and converting the received body data based on the field type.
3. Incorrectly handling field aliases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly extracting and processing the received body data based on the field type. This causes the conversion to be incorrect and leads to incorrect values and types in the return.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to:
1. Correctly handle different field shapes (list, set, tuple) by checking the field type and processing the received body data accordingly.
2. Validate and convert the received body data based on the field type, considering whether it's a standard field, a sequence field, or a file field.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(field.type_, BaseModel):
                    value = field.type_(**received_body).dict()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly processes the received body data based on the field type and shape, and handles the values and errors accordingly.
