The buggy function `request_body_to_args` appears to be incorrectly processing the received body data for different types of sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples. It is failing to correctly parse and validate the received data, resulting in incorrect output when compared to the expected status code and response data in the failing test cases.

The potential error locations within the function include the handling of different field types, parsing the received body data, and validating the values against the required parameters. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of sequences and incorrect validation logic for the different field types.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the parsing and validation of the received body data for different types of sequences and field shapes.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body[field.alias], (list, set, tuple)):
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(value, str) and value == "")
                    or (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                        continue

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function loops through the required params and correctly checks if the field alias exists in the received body. It then validates and populates the `values` dictionary by calling `field.validate` with the appropriate value.

By fixing the logic for parsing and validating the received data, the corrected function should now pass the previously failing test cases.
