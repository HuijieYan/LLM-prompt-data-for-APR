The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for processing received form data and extracting the values and any potential errors. However, it seems to be failing to properly handle cases where there are repeated keys in the form data, which is the scenario described in the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data."

The failing test functions (`test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`) all call the `client.post` method with form data containing repeated keys, such as `"items": ["first", "second", "third"]`. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, resulting in a 422 status code (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200 status code.

The issue arises because the function does not handle repeated keys correctly, and it is not able to extract the values from the received form data as expected when repeated keys are present.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in the form data. Specifically, when processing the received form data, the function needs to recognize repeated keys and store their values as lists, allowing for proper validation against all values for a given key.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            value, error = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if error:
                if isinstance(error, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(error)
                elif isinstance(error, list):
                    errors.extend(error)
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(error, loc=("body", field.alias)))

    return values, errors
```

In the updated function, we iterate over the required parameters and directly retrieve the values as lists using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` for each field, handling repeated keys properly.

With this corrected version, the `request_body_to_args` function should now properly process form data with repeated keys and provide the expected values for validation, resolving the issue and ensuring the associated failing tests pass.
