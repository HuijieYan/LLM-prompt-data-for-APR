Based on the failing test and expected output, it looks like the `request_body_to_args` function is failing to handle repeated keys in form data. The function is not correctly handling the case when the input is a list, set, or tuple in the form data.

The cause of the bug is that when the input is a list, set, or tuple in the form data, the function does not handle it correctly. It fails to recognize the repeated keys and treats each value as a single value. This results in the function returning a status code of 422 instead of 200, as seen in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle repeated keys in form data.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None:
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            received_data = received_body.__dict__.get("multi_items")
        else:
            received_data = received_body

        for field in required_params:
            if received_data is not None and field.alias in received_data:
                value = received_data.getlist(field.alias)
                if field.shape == 1 and len(value) == 1:
                    value = value[0]
            else:
                value = None

            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function now correctly handles repeated keys in form data where the input is a list, set, or tuple. This fix should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This corrected function should be able to address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the support for repeated key=value in form data.
