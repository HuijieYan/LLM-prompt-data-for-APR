### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. It looks like the current function does not support validating repeated keys in form data as expected. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `request_body_to_args` function to support repeated keys and correctly validate them as lists, sets, or tuples based on the parameter type.

Based on the GitHub issue, the function should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This approach will ensure that all the values for the repeated key are captured and correctly validated based on the parameter type.

Let's provide a corrected version of the function that aligns with this strategy.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape == Shape.LIST:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        elif field.shape == Shape.SET:
                            value = {v for v in received_body.getlist(field.alias)}
                        elif field.shape == Shape.TUPLE:
                            value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    else:
                        value = field.default
                else:
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = field.default
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have removed the handling of form data with repeated keys and added logic to handle form data with repeated keys based on the parameter type. For example, if the parameter type is a list, it collects all values for the repeated key as a list. Similarly, for a set or tuple, it collects the values accordingly.

This corrected version should support the validation of repeated keys in form data as expected and address the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
