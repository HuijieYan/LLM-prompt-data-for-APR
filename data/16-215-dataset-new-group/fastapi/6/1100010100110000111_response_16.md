## Analysis
The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200. This suggests that the request is failing due to a validation error.

The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior of parsing repeated key-value pairs in form data is not working as expected, and it is causing validation issues.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data might not be working as expected.
2. The logic for validating and processing form data might be causing the validation errors.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function `request_body_to_args` is not handling repeated key-value pairs in form data correctly. This is causing the validation to fail and returning a status code of 422 instead of 200.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the parsing of repeated key-value pairs in form data and ensure that the validation process works as expected.

## Corrected Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    # Handle repeated key-value pairs
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            # Other validation and processing logic remains the same
            # ...

    return values, errors
``` 

In the corrected function, we have added specific handling for repeated key-value pairs in form data by updating the logic to check for the presence of the key in the form data and get the list of values if the key exists. This change should allow the validation process to work correctly and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
