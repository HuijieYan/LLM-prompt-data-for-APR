The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is caused by incorrect handling of non-typing sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples in the received_body parameter. The function is not properly extracting and handling the values for these non-typing sequence types, leading to incorrect validation and error responses. This results in the failing test cases where the status code is expected to be 200, but the response returns a 422 status code.

The bugs in the function are primarily related to the handling of non-typing sequence types in the received_body. The function does not properly extract the values for these types and performs incorrect validation, which results in the errors and incorrect return values.

To fix the bugs, the function should be modified to correctly handle non-typing sequence types (lists, sets, tuples) in the received_body parameter. This includes extracting the correct values and performing the appropriate validation for these types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                # Perform the appropriate validation for the non-typing sequence types
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the extraction and validation of values for non-typing sequence types have been modified to ensure correct handling and validation. This should address the bugs and allow the function to return the correct values and status codes for the failing test cases.
