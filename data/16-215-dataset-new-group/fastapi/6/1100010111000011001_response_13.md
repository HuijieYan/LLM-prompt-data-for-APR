The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely causing issues with the handling of non-typing sequences in the received body.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic for extracting and validating values from the received body, particularly in cases where the shape of the field is a sequence, such as a list, set, or tuple.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle non-typing sequences in the received body, leading to validation errors. This is evidenced by the failing tests for different types of non-typing sequences, where the expected output does not match the actual output due to validation errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to have better handling and validation for non-typing sequences in the received body. This may involve updating the logic for extracting and validating values, especially when the shape of the field is a sequence.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body[field.alias]
                else:
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to non-typing sequences in the received body by properly handling the extraction and validation of values. This should allow the function to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
