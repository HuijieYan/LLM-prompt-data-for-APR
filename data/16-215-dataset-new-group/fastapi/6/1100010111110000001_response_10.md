The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is encountering issues while processing requests for forms with Python collection types such as lists, sets, and tuples. The failing tests are indicating that the status codes are returning 422 instead of the expected 200.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are specifically where it processes the values received from the form data for the required parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the Python collection types properly. It is potentially treating them as single values instead of handling them as sequential data, resulting in missing or incorrect values being assigned to the `values` and `errors` variables.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve parsing the form data, identifying collection types, and extracting the correct values to populate the `values` variable. Additionally, the function should handle the processing of the form data differently based on the type of parameters it's receiving.

Given the analysis, the provided corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        field_alias = field.alias
        if received_body is not None:
            if field_alias not in received_body:
                value = None
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field_alias)
        if field.required and value is None:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field_alias)))
        else:
            values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function simplifies the processing of the form data. It checks for the existence of the required parameter in the received body and maps it correctly to the `values` dictionary. It also correctly generates any errors for missing required fields. This version should now properly handle the processing of Python collection types in the form data and resolve the issues causing the failing tests.
