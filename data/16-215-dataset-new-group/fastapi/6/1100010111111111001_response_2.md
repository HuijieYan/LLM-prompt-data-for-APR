To fix the buggy `request_body_to_args` function, we need to correct the value assignments, validation checks, and error handling. 

The `received_body` should be updated for different structures based on the type of the required parameter. Also, value validations should be handled accurately, and the appropriate error should be added to the errors list.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(field.type_, (List, Tuple, Set)):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or value == "":
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version:
1. We iterate through the `required_params` and get the value corresponding to the field from the `received_body`.
2. We handle each type of field (List, Tuple, Set) separately for value extraction and validation.
3. If there are errors during validation, they are added to the `errors` list.
4. Finally, the `values` and `errors` are returned as the result.

The corrected `request_body_to_args` function ensures the extraction and validation of different types according to the `required_params` and handles errors appropriately. This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
