Based on the expected values and types of variables, the buggy function has several potential bugs:

1. The `embed` variable is being set to None by `getattr(field_info, "embed", None)` which may cause issues with further comparison on line 10.

2. The `received_body` value is being overwritten in line 13 based on the condition in line 11, which may lead to inaccurate processing of the received body.

3. There is a potential issue with `value` assignment based on different conditions that might not cover all cases.

To fix these issues, we need to refactor the function to handle the conditions and assignments for `embed`, `received_body`, and `value` more accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", True)  # Fix to set a default value for embed
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                value = field.default  # Use the default value if received value is None

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we've set a default value for `embed` to `True` to ensure it has a valid value for comparison.

We've also removed the condition to overwrite `received_body` and instead directly process the value based on the conditions.

Lastly, we added a condition to use the default value if `value` is None.

These changes should address the potential bugs and ensure that the function returns the expected output for all the provided cases.
