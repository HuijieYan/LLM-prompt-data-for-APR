The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for processing the received body and required parameters to extract the values and errors. It appears that the bug is related to the processing of FormData and the way values are extracted for different types of parameters. The bug causes the tests to fail with the status code error because the validation and extraction of the received body for different types of parameters are not handled correctly.

The function `request_body_to_args` extracts the values and errors from the received body and required parameters. It processes the values and checks for a variety of conditions, such as whether the value is `None`, whether the field is required, whether the received body is empty, and handling file uploads. However, the bug seems to stem from how the values are being extracted based on the type of parameter and the received body.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to review and refactor the logic for extracting values from the received body based on the type of parameter. This should include handling different types of parameters such as lists, sets, and tuples, and ensuring that values are extracted and validated correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Handle different field types for extraction and validation
                    if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "" or len(value) == 0:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the values are extracted based on the type of parameter and appropriately handled. For example, for list, set, and tuple types, the extraction and validation logic is tailored to handle each type correctly, and the received body is processed accordingly.

This should address the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing tests without errors related to status codes.
