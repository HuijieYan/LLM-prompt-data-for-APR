The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing because it doesn't handle the input data correctly for sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples. It exhibits different issues for each of the sequences, where it fails to correctly validate and extract the data from the input.

The potential error locations in the code are:
1. Handling of different types of sequences (lists, sets, tuples) in the `request_body_to_args` function, especially with respect to the received_body and value extraction.
2. The validation and extraction of values from the received_body for sequences of different types.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle different sequence types and fails to validate and extract values from the received_body. This leads to incorrect values being returned and incorrect error reporting.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to revise the logic that handles different sequence types and to ensure that the values are extracted and validated correctly for each type of sequence.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == 2:
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == 3:
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue


            if (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version, I have included a conditional check to handle different types of sequences (lists, sets, tuples) and extract the data from the input. The values are then validated and returned accordingly. This should fix the issues with handling sequence data and ensure that the function correctly extracts and validates the input values.
