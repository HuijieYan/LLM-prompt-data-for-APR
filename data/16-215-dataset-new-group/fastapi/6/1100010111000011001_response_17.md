The main issue with the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be with the way it handles non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is supposed to convert the received body into arguments, but it fails to handle non-typing sequences properly, leading to errors when dealing with these types of data.

To fix the function, we need to update the logic for handling non-typing sequences and ensure that the correct values are extracted from the received body.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we removed the unnecessary checks for specific types and simplified the handling of sequence shapes. Now, the function should properly handle non-typing sequences and should pass the failing tests.
