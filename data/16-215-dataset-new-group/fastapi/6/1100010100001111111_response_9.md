The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data. The function is intended to process form data and convert it into arguments, but it does not handle repeated keys correctly. The issue on GitHub describes the problem as only the last key=value pair winning, and the expected behavior is to collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation happens.

Looking at the function implementation and the related runtime input/output values, it's clear that the current approach does not support the expected behavior for repeated keys. In each case, the `received_body` is being processed to obtain the values for the required parameters, but the handling of repeated keys is not implemented as expected.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to handle repeated keys in form data properly and assign their values as a list. This will ensure that the behavior aligns with the GitHub issue's expected solution.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.required and not values[field.alias]:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
            else:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, when processing the `received_body`, the function explicitly checks for repeated keys and assigns their values as lists if the shape is determined to be a sequence. This ensures that the function can handle repeated keys as expected.

By making these changes, the corrected function aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
