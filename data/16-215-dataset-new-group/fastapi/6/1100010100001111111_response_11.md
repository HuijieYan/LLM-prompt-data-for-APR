The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to stem from the handling of repeated keys in form data, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. When there are repeated keys, the function is only considering the last value and not collecting all the values into a list for validation.

The potential error location is the section of code that checks for `sequence_shapes` and handles the values accordingly. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case where there are repeated keys in the form data.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly collecting all the values for repeated keys before validation, as expected by the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to collect all values for repeated keys and store them in a list before validation. This will allow it to properly validate and return the correct values and errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is None:
                        if field.required:
                            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    else:
                        if (
                            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                        ):
                            value = await value.read()
                        elif (
                            field.shape in sequence_shapes
                            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                        ):
                            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we check for repeated keys in the form data and collect all the values into a list before validation. This ensures that the function correctly handles repeated keys and returns the expected values and errors.

This fix should address the issue raised in the GitHub post and ensure that the `request_body_to_args` function behaves as intended.
