The error messages for all the failing tests indicate that the response status code is 422, while it is expected to be 200. This implies that there is an issue with request validation, specifically with converting the received data into appropriate arguments.

The potential error location in the `request_body_to_args` function is in the section where the received data is processed and validated against the required parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle sequence-shaped parameters (e.g., Python list, set, tuple) when passed as form data. As a result, the received data is not transformed correctly and leads to a 422 status code.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle sequence-shaped form data and process it appropriately, converting it to the correct argument types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None and field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                elif value is None and not field.required:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we removed unnecessary handling of sequence-shaped parameters and simplified the logic for processing received form data against the required parameters. This should allow the function to properly convert the received data into appropriate arguments, fixing the bugs and ensuring that the failing tests pass without throwing a 422 status code.
