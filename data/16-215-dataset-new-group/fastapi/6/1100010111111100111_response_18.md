To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to address the key issues causing the failing tests. The problem arises from how the function handles repeated keys in form data, and it directly relates to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data."

1. **Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:**
   The potential error locations in the function are related to how it processes form data with repeated keys. Specifically, the code does not handle repeated keys properly, leading to the failing tests.

2. **Explain the cause of the bug:**
   The cause of the bug is that the function is not appropriately handling repeated keys in form data, leading to incorrect values and types being returned, which causes the failing tests.

3. **Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:**
   To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle repeated keys in form data. Specifically, when fetching values from form data, the function should collect repeated keys and assign the values as a list to the same key before validation occurs.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]] = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if field.required and (value is None or value == []):
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            elif value is None:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, list):
                    if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                        values[field.name] = value
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = value[0]
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- We handle repeated keys in form data by using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` to retrieve the values as a list of strings.
- We properly handle the `required` attribute of the field when determining whether to populate `values` or append to `errors`.

This correction ensures that the function properly handles repeated keys in form data and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

After making these corrections, the failing tests should pass, and the reported issue on GitHub should be resolved.
