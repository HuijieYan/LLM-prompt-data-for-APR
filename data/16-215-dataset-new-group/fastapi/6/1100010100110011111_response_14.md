The issue with the provided function is that it doesn't handle repeated keys in the form data input. The function needs to be updated to support repeated key=value pairs in form data. 

The current implementation uses the `get` method to retrieve values from the form data, which only returns the last value associated with the specified key. To fix this, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys as lists of values.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys in the form data input correctly, leading to validation errors and a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data, and to validate the input values against the expected data types.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        if isinstance(field, ModelField):
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.Form):
                    if isinstance(field.type_, list) or isinstance(field.type_, set) or isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                        value = []
                if field.required and not value:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    if value:
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over each field in the required parameters and handle the repeated keys in the form data correctly. We also handle special cases for list, set, and tuple data types to ensure that repeated keys are collected and validated properly.

This updated function should fix the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub while passing the failing tests.
