The buggy function `request_body_to_args` in `fastapi/dependencies/utils.py` has a bug related to processing form data with repeated keys. This bug causes the failing tests `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`.

The problem is caused by the fact that the `request_body_to_args` function does not correctly handle Form Data with repeated keys.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `request_body_to_args` to correctly handle Form Data with repeated keys and ensure that all values are collected in a list before validation.

Based on the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data", it seems that the solution involves collecting repeated keys in the 2-tuple list and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Based on this information, here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
                # If the shape is sequence and the value is list, we store it as it is
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                    values[field.name] = value
                # If the field is not a sequence and the value is a list, we store only the first value
                elif not field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                    values[field.name] = value[0]
                # For other types of values we process as usual
                else:
                    if (
                        value is None
                        or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                        or (
                            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                            and len(value) == 0
                        )
                    ):
                        if field.required:
                            if PYDANTIC_1:
                                errors.append(
                                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                                )
                            else:  # pragma: nocover
                                errors.append(
                                    ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                        MissingError(),
                                        loc=("body", field.alias),
                                        config=BaseConfig,
                                    )
                                )
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue
                    if (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                    ):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                    ):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we handle cases where the shape is a sequence and the value is a list. We also handle non-sequence shapes and list values, storing only the first value. All other types of values are processed as usual.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and make the failing tests pass.
