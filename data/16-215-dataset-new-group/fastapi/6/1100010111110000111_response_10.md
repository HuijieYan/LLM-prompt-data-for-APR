The buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be processing request data and validating against required parameters. However, it is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly and is causing the failing tests to return a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle repeated keys in form data and only validates against the last value. This causes the test to fail as it is expecting a 200 status code, but the buggy function is returning a 422 status code for validation errors.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be able to handle repeated keys in form data and create a list of values for those keys. This aligns with the GitHub issue raised, and the fix should allow for validation against all values associated with the same key.

The corrected version of the function should handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}

    # Iterate through all the required parameters
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                # Special case for file fields
                if isinstance(value, Sequence):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                else:
                    value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version will correctly handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens, resolving the failing tests and also aligning with the GitHub issue raised.
