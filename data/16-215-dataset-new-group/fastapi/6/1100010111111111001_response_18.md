To address the failing tests, we will look at the request_body_to_args function and requirement for handling list, set, and tuple types.

The issue in the current implementation arises from the way the function handles the received_body when evaluating the input parameters and the presence of multiple attribute values. The first issue is that it overwrites the received_body with a new dictionary, assuming that there's only one required parameter and it is not embedded. The second issue is with how it processes the value for the received_body.

To fix the issue, we can modify the way the received_body is processed for these types. We'll also add a condition to distinguish between lists, sets, and tuples, and ensure that the value corresponds to the correct data structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we removed the condition that modified the received_body for the case where only one parameter is present and it is not embedded. Values are now processed based on the defined shape and retrieved using the get method. Additionally, we maintained the logic to handle file types and sequence shapes based on the defined field properties.

With this correction, the failing tests for list, set, and tuple types should now pass and return the expected status code and response values.
