## Problem Analysis
The `request_body_to_args` function is responsible for converting received request data into arguments. There are a few potential error locations within the function:
1. The function is attempting to validate the received body data and create a dictionary of values for required parameters. If there is a missing or invalid parameter, it generates an error and adds it to the `errors` list.
2. The function checks if the `required_params` list is not empty and fetches the first field to check if it's embedded or not, and then uses it to modify the `received_body` data accordingly.
3. The function iterates over each field in the `required_params` list and processes the data based on the field type and shape. It also handles file input correctly.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `request_body_to_args` function processes request data and generates the `values` and `errors` lists. It seems that the function is failing to properly handle the request data for certain types of input, leading to validation errors and an incorrect status code being returned.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `request_body_to_args` function correctly processes the received body data for different types of input, including lists, sets, and tuples. Additionally, we may need to check if the `required_params` list and `field_info` for each parameter are being handled correctly.

The corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should ensure that it properly handles each different type of input and returns the correct values and errors for the given parameters.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None or value == "":
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    if (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                    ):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                    ):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have removed the check for the first field being not embedded and modifying the `received_body`. We also streamlined the validation process for different input types, ensuring that the correct values and errors are added to the respective lists.

By using the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function, the failing tests should now pass with the correct status codes and expected values.
