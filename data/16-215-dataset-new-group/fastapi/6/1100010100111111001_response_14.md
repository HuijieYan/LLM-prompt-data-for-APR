The issue with the buggy function is that it incorrectly handles non-typing sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples in the received body data. This leads to incorrect validation and errors being returned even when the data is valid. 
To fix this bug, the code should be updated to properly handle non-typing sequence shapes in the received body data and perform validation.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if field_info:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if isinstance(field_info, ModelField) and field.required:
                    if field.alias not in received_body:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                if value is not None:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and all(isinstance(val, UploadFile) for val in value):
                        awaitables = [val.read() for val in value]
                        value = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](value)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version properly ensures that non-typing sequence shapes are handled correctly, and the validation is performed based on the actual data received in the field.
