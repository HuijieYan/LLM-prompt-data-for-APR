The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely related to the handling of repeated keys when the input is in the form of URL encoded data, causing the function to only process the last key=value pair instead of collecting all values for the same key and treating them as a list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle repeated keys in the incoming `FormData` object and produce a list of values associated with the same key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = field.default
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))) 
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected function has been updated to handle repeated keys in the `FormData` object by checking if the key is present in the form data and using `getlist` to retrieve a list of values associated with the same key. Additionally, the function appropriately handles missing values and validation errors.

This corrected function should resolve the bug and allow the function to process repeated keys in the form data correctly, resulting in the expected output and passing the failing tests.
