The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data.

The cause of the bug is that when the `received_body` is a `FormData` object with repeated keys, the function does not handle them correctly, resulting in missing or incorrectly processed values.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle repeated keys in the `FormData` object correctly. We can achieve this by checking if a field is present multiple times in the `FormData` object and collecting all its values into a list before processing, to ensure that all values are accounted for.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            records = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            if len(records) > 1:
                value = records
            elif len(records) == 1:
                value = records[0]
            else:
                value = None

            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function handles repeated keys in the `FormData` object correctly and collects all their values into a list before processing. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and also fix the failing tests.

Please make sure to test the corrected function with various scenarios to ensure that it behaves as expected in all cases.
