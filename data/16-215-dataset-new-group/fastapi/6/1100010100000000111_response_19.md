The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is related to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data". The issue complains that in FastAPI, only the last key=value wins when using URL encoded data with repeated keys. The issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Handling repeated keys in form data.
2. Validation of form data against the last value.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The current implementation does not handle repeated keys, and it only validates against the last value.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if values[field.name] is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, e_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(e_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(e_)
                elif isinstance(e_, list):
                    errors.extend(e_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we loop through each `field` in `required_params` and directly assign the received values to `values[field.name]`. If the field is required and the value is None, we append a `MissingError` to the `errors` list. Finally, we validate the field's value and append any resulting errors to the `errors` list.

This corrected version addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue by properly handling repeated keys in form data and validating against all received values.
