The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has an issue with processing repeated keys in form data, which leads to failing tests. The function fails to handle repeated keys correctly, resulting in incorrect results when inputs contain repeating keys.

The buggy function needs to correctly process repeated keys in form data, as described in the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data". The issue details the problem with processing repeated keys in form data and requests that FastAPI collects repeated keys and assigns their values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be updated to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. Each repeating key should be collected and assigned as a list to the same key before validation takes place.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and hasattr(value, "append"):
                    value = list(value)
            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args`, the loop has been updated to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. Each repeating key's values are collected and assigned as a list to the same key before validation occurs. This change addresses the issue with the processing of repeated keys in form data and resolves the failing test cases.

With the corrected version of the function, the tests should now pass, and the issue posted on GitHub should also be resolved.
