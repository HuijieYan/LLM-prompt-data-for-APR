The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has a problem with handling repeated keys in form data, which is causing the failing test cases to return 422 instead of the expected 200 status code. Specifically, the function fails to properly handle repeated keys when parsing form data into argument values. This is revealed through the failing tests `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic for handling values in the `received_body` when it is a `FormData` object. The function incorrectly treats the values as single values instead of lists of values for repeated keys, resulting in the incorrect validation behavior. This issue has also been documented in a GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data."

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling repeated keys in the `request_body_to_args` function and ensure that when parsing form data, the values for repeated keys are collected into lists before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is None:
        received_body = {}

    for field in required_params:
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else [received_body[field.alias]]
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This correction ensures that for each field in `required_params`, if the field's alias is present in the received body, it collects its values into a list to handle repeated keys properly. With this correction, the failing test cases should return the expected 200 status code, resolving the issue documented on GitHub.
