The buggy function `request_body_to_args` attempts to process and validate the data received in the request body against a set of required parameters.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect handling of received_body when `embed` is not None.
2. Incorrect validation or handling of empty or missing values for required fields.
3. Potential issues with validating file uploads and sequence shapes.

Cause of the bug:
The bug appears to arise from incorrect handling of the received_body and errors in the validation logic for required fields.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check for and correct any issues related to handling the `embed` property within the required params.
2. Properly handle and validate empty or missing values for required fields.
3. Ensure the correct validation logic for file uploads and sequence shapes.

Here is a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we have handled the required_params and received_body properly. The logic for validating field values and handling empty/missing values has also been corrected. Additionally, the validation logic for file uploads and sequence shapes has been improved.
