In the given buggy function, the issue is with how repeated keys in form data are handled. The function does not correctly handle repeated keys, leading to an incorrect output. This corresponds to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data."

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function handles repeated keys in form data. Currently, the function only takes the last key=value pair into account, which results in incorrect validation and errors for the expected input. The function should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list to the same key before validation occurs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(values_list) == 1:
                    value = values_list[0]
                else:
                    value = values_list
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that repeated keys are handled correctly, and their values are assigned to a list before validation takes place. This change addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and will provide the expected output for the failing tests.
