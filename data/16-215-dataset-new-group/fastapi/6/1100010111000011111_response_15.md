The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has a bug related to processing form data with repeated keys, as raised in the GitHub issue. The function iterates through the `required_params` and attempts to extract data from the `received_body` based on the field aliases. However, when the `received_body` contains repeated keys, the function does not handle them correctly, resulting in a failure to create a list of values for the same key.

The cause of the bug is related to the way the function handles sequence-shaped fields (e.g., list, set, tuple) in form data and attempts to extract values based on aliases. It does not handle repeated keys correctly, leading to the creation of a dictionary with a single value for the key instead of a list of values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to account for repeated keys in the form data and ensure that values associated with the same key are correctly extracted as a list. This will align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug and aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the GitHub issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(value) == 1:
                    value = value[0]
                values[field.name] = value
            else:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles repeated keys in the form data and assigns the values associated with the same key as a list before validation happens, as described in the GitHub issue. It should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
