Based on the GitHub issue and the expected input/output values, the buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be unable to handle repeated key=value pairs in form data. The bug causes the function to only validate against the last value, rather than collecting repeated keys in the 2-tuple list and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation.

The potential error locations in the function include the handling of `FormData` and the validation process for values.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated key=value pairs in form data correctly. The function should be modified to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for repeated key=value pairs in form data and collect them as a list before the validation process.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        # Collect repeated key=value pairs as a list
        form_data = received_body
        repeated_params = {}
        for key, value in form_data.items():
            if key in repeated_params:
                if isinstance(repeated_params[key], list):
                    repeated_params[key].append(value)
                else:
                    repeated_params[key] = [repeated_params[key], value]
            else:
                repeated_params[key] = value

        # Update received body with collected repeated key=value pairs as lists
        received_body = {}
        for key, value in repeated_params.items():
            if isinstance(value, list):
                received_body[key] = value
            else:
                received_body[key] = value

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        # ... (rest of the function logic remains the same)

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we introduced a process to collect repeated key=value pairs in the `FormData` and assign them as lists to the same key before validation. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function properly handles repeated key=value pairs in form data.
