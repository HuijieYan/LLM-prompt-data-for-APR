The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing the failing tests due to the incorrect handling of form data with repeated keys. The issue in GitHub also points out this problem and requests support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.

The bug is likely located in the section of the code that handles form data with repeated keys. The code needs to be updated to correctly parse and handle repeated key=value pairs.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of repeated keys in the form data. When the form data contains repeated keys, the function only considers the last key=value pair and does not properly collect and validate repeated keys as a list.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to handle repeated keys in the form data and assign those values to a list before validation happens.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Handle repeated keys as a list
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            # Rest of the code remains the same

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version above, the change is made in the section that handles form data with repeated keys. When `FormData` is used and the field has a sequence shape, it uses the `getlist` method to obtain the values as a list, which allows the repeated keys to be correctly collected and handled as a list.

With this correction, the function should handle repeated keys in form data correctly and pass the failing tests.

After applying this fix, the tests for `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` should pass without any assertion errors.
