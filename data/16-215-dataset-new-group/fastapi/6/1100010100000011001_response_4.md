The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to process required parameters and received body and return a dictionary of values and a list of errors. However, there are several issues with the function as identified below:

1. The function is using `received_body` for parameter names, but this is in fact a typo and should be `required_params`. This is likely causing the function to misinterpret the input data.

2. Inside the function, the logic for processing the `received_body` and populating the `values` and `errors` lists is complex and difficult to follow. This is leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

3. There are also issues with the way the types of the input parameters and the expected values of intermediate variables are being handled.


To fix the buggy function, we will:
1. Correct the `received_body` typo to `required_params`.
2. Simplify the processing logic to accurately handle the required parameters and received body.
3. Ensure that the types of input parameters and expected values of variables are as required by the test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value = None
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            # Handle file types
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            # Handle sequence shapes
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            # Validate the value
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we have simplified the processing logic by directly checking if the field alias is present in the received body and retrieving its value. We then validate the value, handle file types and sequence shapes appropriately, and populate the `values` and `errors` lists as necessary.

With this corrected version, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all provided test cases.
