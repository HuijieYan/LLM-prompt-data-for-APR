In the given buggy function `request_body_to_args`, the issue seems to be that it does not handle form data containing repeated keys in the expected way, causing the failing tests to receive a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. This is a known issue with the implementation of handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.

To fix the bug and resolve the failing tests, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs and validate against all the values, as mentioned in the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data".

Given the provided information, we can suggest the following strategy to fix the bug:
- Modify the `request_body_to_args` function to collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.
- Update the validation logic to handle repeated key=value pairs and validate against all the values for the given key.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name], field_errors = field.validate(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
            if field_errors:
                errors.extend(field_errors)

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `received_body` is not None and of type `FormData`, and then validate each field against the list of values obtained using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)`. This approach allows for handling repeated keys in form data and performing validation against all the values.

With this corrected version, the failing tests should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub related to supporting repeated key=value in form data should be resolved.
