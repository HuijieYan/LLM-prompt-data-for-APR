After analyzing the buggy function and the provided GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data. Specifically, the current implementation of the `request_body_to_args` function does not properly handle repeated keys in the form data when validating against the last value.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `received_body` parameter is being modified within the function, which can cause unexpected behavior.
2. The logic for handling repeated key=value pairs in form data is not present in the function.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling repeated key=value pairs in the form data, leading to only the last key=value winning. This behavior does not align with the expectations of the GitHub issue, which suggests that repeated keys should be collected and assigned to a list before validation.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data by collecting all values corresponding to the same key and assigning them to a list before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        form_data_dict = await received_body.form()
        for field in required_params:
            value = form_data_dict.getlist(field.alias)
            if not value and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if the `received_body` is a FormData instance and then uses the `getlist` method to retrieve all values associated with a specific key as a list. It then performs the validation for each field and appends any errors to the error list.

By making these adjustments, the function is now able to properly collect repeated key=value pairs in form data and assign them to a list before validation, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
