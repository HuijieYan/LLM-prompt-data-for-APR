Based on the failing tests and the expected input/output values, as well as the information from the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue lies in how the function handles repeated keys in form data. The current function does not support repeated key=value pairs in form data, causing the tests to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys properly. It only processes the last value for a given key, leading to incorrect validation. This is evident from the failing tests where the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 422.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` should be updated to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by aggregating the values into a list for each key.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and all(v == '' for v in value))
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    else:
                        value = await value.read()

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, when retrieving values from the form data, we explicitly use `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` to get all the values for a given key, aggregating them into a list. This ensures that repeated keys are handled correctly, and the values are used for validation as expected.

The corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix aligns with the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
