It seems that the issue stems from the behavior of FastAPI's request.form() method, where repeated keys in the form data are not handled as a list, causing issues with validation. To fix this, the request_body_to_args function needs to be updated to handle this scenario and correctly convert the repeated keys into a list for validation.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that the received_body is not being properly handled when it contains repeated keys. It fails to convert the repeated keys into a list for validation, leading to issues with validation against multiple values for the same key.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys in the form data and treat them as a list for validation.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value and field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    if field.required and len(value) == 0:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, the received_body with repeated keys is properly handled by using the `getlist` method from FormData to retrieve all values for the same key as a list. This ensures that the function correctly converts repeated keys into a list for validation.

This updated implementation should resolve the issue and ensure that the function handles repeated keys in form data as expected.

Additionally, this fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the handling of repeated key=value in form data. By handling repeated keys as a list for validation, it aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the problem outlined in the GitHub issue.
