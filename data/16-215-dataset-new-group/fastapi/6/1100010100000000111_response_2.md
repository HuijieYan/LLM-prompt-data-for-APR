The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received request body into arguments. The bug relates to the incorrect handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data. The function only validates against the last value, whereas it should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation occurs.

The potential error in the function is related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs within the form data. The function is not correctly collecting repeated keys and their values as a list before the validation process.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle repeated key=value pairs in form data as expected, resulting in only the last key=value pair being validated.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation occurs. This will ensure that all values for a repeated key are collected and validated properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
    
    for field in required_params:
        if (
            values[field.name] is None
            or (isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form) and values[field.name] == "")
            or (
                isinstance(get_field_info(field), params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(values[field.name]) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
    
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, a loop has been added to populate values for all required parameters based on the received body. Additionally, the validation process has been updated to correctly handle the values for repeated key=value pairs in form data. This modification aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue and addresses the bug.
