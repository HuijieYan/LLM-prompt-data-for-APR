The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert received form data into a dictionary of values and a list of errors for validation. However, the function encounters issues when dealing with forms that contain repeated keys (e.g., lists, sets, tuples), and fails to handle them correctly. This leads to failing tests where the expected values are not being produced.

The potential error locations in the function are:
1. Handling of repeated keys within the form data.
2. Validation of fields with shapes that are sequences (lists, sets, tuples).
3. Populating the `values` and `errors` variables based on the received form data.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters repeated keys within form data, it fails to collect the values for those keys into a sequence (list, set, tuple) as expected. Instead, it only considers the last value and discards the rest. This leads to validation errors and incorrect population of the `values` and `errors` variables, resulting in failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data and properly validate sequences of values. Additionally, the function should populate the `values` and `errors` variables accurately based on the received form data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from fastapi.form import FormData
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.sub_fields:
                        sub_values = []
                        for sub_field in field.sub_fields:
                            sub_value = received_body.get(sub_field.alias)
                            sub_values.append(sub_value)
                        value = tuple(sub_values) if field.shape in (3, 4) else sub_values
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function includes updates to handle repeated keys properly and perform accurate validation of sequences. The `values` and `errors` variables are populated correctly based on the received form data. This version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding support for repeated key=value in form data.
