Based on the analysis of the failing tests, the bug is likely caused by the mishandling of sequence shapes when processing form data. In particular, the `request_body_to_args` function fails to correctly handle the parsing of form data with repeated keys such as the case with lists, sets, or tuples. This leads to incorrect validation and, ultimately, the failing of the tests.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario of repeated keys in the form data. This requires modifying the logic for processing form data, and specifically handling the cases of lists, sets, and tuples.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            alias = field.alias
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape == 1:
                            value = received_body.getlist(alias)
                        elif field.shape == 2:
                            value = tuple(received_body.getlist(alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, set, tuple)):
                if field.shape == 1:
                    values[field.name] = value
                else:
                    values[field.name] = tuple(value)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function explicitly checks for the sequence shape of the field and handles the parsing of form data accordingly. Additionally, it correctly assigns the parsed values to the `values` dictionary and populates the `errors` list based on the validation results.

This corrected version should properly handle the form data with repeated keys and pass the failing tests. Additionally, it addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data.
