The `request_body_to_args` function has multiple issues that need to be addressed. One of the main problems is that it fails to correctly recognize sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples in the received_body, leading to incorrect validation and missing errors in the response.

The function also doesn't handle sequences correctly when received as FormData, resulting in incorrect values and types. Moreover, there are discrepancies in the handling of Form and File field types, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bugs in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to correct the logic that handles sequences, Form fields, and File fields, ensuring that the function correctly identifies and processes the different types of input data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        field_alias = field.alias
        field_type = field.type_

        if received_body is not None:
            if field_alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field_alias]

                if value == [] or value == "":
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field_alias)))
                        continue
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue

                if lenient_issubclass(field_type, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif lenient_issubclass(field_type, bytes) and isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [await v.read() if isinstance(v, UploadFile) else v for v in value]

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field_alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we handle the field's alias, type, and value, checking for required fields and processing the input data accordingly. This version aims to correctly identify sequences, Form fields, and File fields, and validate their values appropriately based on the type of field.

By using this corrected version of the function, it is expected to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values for each case.
