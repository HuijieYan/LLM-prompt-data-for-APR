The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data. The issue identified in the GitHub thread suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in a 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation occurs. This aligns with the expected behavior of the `choices: list = Form(...)` parameter.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling repeated key=value pairs in form data, resulting in only the last key=value pair being used for validation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in the form data, and ensure that all the values are collected and assigned as a list to the same key before validation.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        field_names = {field.alias for field in required_params}
        for field_alias in field_names:
            values[field_alias] = []
            for k, v in received_body.items():
                if k == field_alias:
                    if isinstance(v, list):
                        values[field_alias].extend(v)
                    else:
                        values[field_alias].append(v)

        for field in required_params:
            value = values[field.alias]
            # rest of the function remains unchanged
            # ...
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the keys in the form data, and for each field alias, we collect all the values associated with that alias and store them as a list in the `values` dictionary. This ensures that all the values for repeated key=value pairs are collected and assigned to the same key before validation occurs.

This approach aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, and should resolve the bug in the function.
