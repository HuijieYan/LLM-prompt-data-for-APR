The issue is related to the handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data, where only the last key=value is being considered. This is causing issues with validation.

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has multiple areas that could potentially lead to the bug, particularly in the section that handles the values from the `received_body` and assigns them to the `values` dictionary.

The cause of the bug is that the function is overriding the previous value with the same key. This means that repeated key-value pairs are not being handled correctly, resulting in only the last key=value being considered.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs and assign them as a list of values for the same key before validation occurs.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is not None and field.shape not in sequence_shapes:
                    value = value[-1]
            if (
                value is None
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version of the function, we have modified the part that assigns values to the `values` dictionary to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs and assign them as lists of values for the same key before validation occurs. This should fix the bug and support repeated key=value pairs as requested in the GitHub issue.
