The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to the processing of repeated keys in form data. The function currently does not handle repeated keys properly and does not convert them into lists before validation. This issue is reported on GitHub with the title "Support repeated key=value in form data."

The bug is related to the handling of repeated keys in the form data. The function should collect the repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation. However, the function fails to do so, resulting in an incorrect validation and return values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle repeated keys in the form data by collecting the values into lists before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Look for repeated keys and convert their values into lists
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if len(value) == 1:
                        value = value[0]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
            # (no changes to the other parts of the function)
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version of the function, the function should properly handle repeated keys in the form data and return the expected values and types specified in the test cases. Additionally, this fix should also address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the support for repeated key=value in form data.
