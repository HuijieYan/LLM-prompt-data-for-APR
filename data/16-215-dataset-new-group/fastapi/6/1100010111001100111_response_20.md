The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data, as described in the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data." When receiving form data with repeated keys, the function is not properly collecting and validating the values as a list or other collection type, leading to incorrect behavior.

In the buggy function, the error likely occurs around the handling of repeated keys in the form data. The function is not correctly collecting and validating the values as a list, set, or tuple for the corresponding field.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to recognize repeated keys in the form data and appropriately handle them as a list, set, or tuple during validation.

Here's a corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                # Handling repeated keys in form data
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = []
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            # Perform validation for the field
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we iterate through the `required_params` and handle repeated keys in the form data by using `received_body.getlist(field.alias)` to collect the values as a list. We then perform the validation for each field and handle errors accordingly.

This corrected version should address the issue raised in the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
