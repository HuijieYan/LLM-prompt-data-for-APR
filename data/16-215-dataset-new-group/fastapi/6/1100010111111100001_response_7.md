The issue with the buggy function is that it does not properly handle the conversion of input data to the expected data types for sequences (lists, sets, tuples). This results in incorrect values being returned, which causes the failing test cases.

The bug in the function lies in the handling of different types of sequences when extracting values from the received body and converting them to the expected data types. Specifically, when dealing with lists, sets, and tuples, the function does not handle the conversion correctly, resulting in the incorrect validation of the received data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the extraction and conversion of values for different types of sequences, ensuring that they are correctly validated and returned in the expected format.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == 1:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == 2:
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == 3:
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                value = field.default
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
