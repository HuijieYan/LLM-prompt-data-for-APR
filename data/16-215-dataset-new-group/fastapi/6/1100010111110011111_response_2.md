## The cause of the bug
The `request_body_to_args` function has a bug that causes it to fail in handling form input data with repeated keys, such as lists, sets, and tuples. This limitation is causing the failing tests because the function is not correctly detecting and handling repeated keys in the form data, leading to validation errors.

In particular, the function fails to properly parse repeated keys in the form data, leading to validation errors and an incorrect response status code. This is related to the GitHub issue, as it is requesting support for repeated key-value pairs in form data.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to update the logic to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data. This involves modifying how the function processes form data and applies validation to ensure that repeated keys are properly handled and validated as lists, sets, or tuples.

The corrected version of the function should be able to parse repeated keys in the form data and validate them accordingly. Additionally, it should return the correct status code and response data for the input form data with repeated keys.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            if value is not None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have removed the code related to embedding the fields and adjusted the logic to properly handle repeated keys in the form data. This should address the bug and ensure that the function can correctly handle form data with repeated keys, such as lists, sets, and tuples.
