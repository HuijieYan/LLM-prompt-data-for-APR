The issue in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be with how it handles the `required_params` and `received_body`. It appears that the function is not correctly processing the received body data, causing errors in the validation process.

The failing tests indicate that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200, which suggests that the validation of the request is not working as expected.

To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the received body data and performs the required validation.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        elif isinstance(received_body, dict):
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        else:
            value = None

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
1. I removed the unnecessary conditionals and simplified the logic to better handle the received body data, whether it's a `FormData` object or a dictionary.
2. I updated the way the `values` dictionary is populated based on the received body data and the input field specifications.
3. I streamlined the validation process for each field in the `required_params` list.

After applying these corrections, the failing tests should pass successfully.
