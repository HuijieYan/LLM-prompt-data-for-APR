## The buggy function and its relationship with the error message and the GitHub issue

The `request_body_to_args` function takes a list of required parameters and a received body, and then processes the data to create a `values` dictionary and an `errors` list. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not returning the expected status code, and the GitHub issue suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation. This indicates that the function is not handling repeated keys in the form data correctly, which results in validation errors.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Handling of repeated keys in form data.
2. Validation of received data against the required parameters.

## Explanation of the bug
The buggy function is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly, as indicated by the failing tests and the GitHub issue. When the received form data contains repeated keys, the function fails to process them as lists and ends up with validation errors when trying to process the values against the required parameters.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data. When a parameter has multiple values with the same key, the function should process those values as lists and then validate them against the required parameters.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version of the function, we iterate over the required parameters and directly access the values from the received_body using the parameter's alias. If the value is None, we append a MissingError to the errors list. Otherwise, we validate the value against the field and add any errors to the errors list or add the validated value to the values dictionary.

This corrected version should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub by correctly handling repeated keys in the form data.
