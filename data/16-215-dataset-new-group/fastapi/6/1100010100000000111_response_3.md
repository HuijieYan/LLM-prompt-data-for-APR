The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is part of the FastAPI framework and is used to convert request body parameters into a dictionary of values and a list of errors. The function seems to encounter issues when dealing with repeated keys in form data, as outlined in the GitHub issue. 

In the buggy function, the potential error locations are as follows:
1. The section where it attempts to handle repeated keys in form data.
2. The validation of form data and handling of errors.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle repeated keys in form data, leading to only the last key=value pair being considered, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly process repeated keys in form data and assign their values as a list before validation occurs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles repeated keys in form data by using the `getlist` method to retrieve a list of values for a specific key. This approach ensures that all values are considered during validation. Additionally, the error handling and validation process has been adjusted to accommodate the changes in form data processing.
