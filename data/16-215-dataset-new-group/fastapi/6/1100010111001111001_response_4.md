The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is that it doesn't handle non-typing sequence types (list, set, tuple) properly when received as `FormData`. It incorrectly processes these non-typing sequence types and does not validate them correctly, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle non-typing sequence types (list, set, tuple) when received as `FormData`, and validate them correctly using the pydantic library.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            elif isinstance(field.type_, list):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
            elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function handles non-typing sequence types appropriately and validates them correctly based on their types.

After applying this fix, the failing test cases should pass as expected.
