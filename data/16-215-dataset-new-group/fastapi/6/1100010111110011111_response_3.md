The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing it to fail for different types of input data. The function is not handling the case where the received data contains repeated keys. This issue is associated with a GitHub feature request to support repeated key=value pairs in form data.

The cause of the bug is related to the function's handling of form data, especially when dealing with repeated keys. When the input form data contains repeated keys, the current implementation only considers the last key=value pair, leading to incorrect validation and error handling.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle repeated keys in the input form data and create a list of values for those keys before the validation step.

Below is the corrected and updated version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body[field.alias], list
                    ):
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or value == "":
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(value, list)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function properly checks for repeated keys in the input form data and processes them as lists. Additionally, the validation and error handling logic has been improved to handle the updated data structure.

By using this corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function, the failing test cases are expected to pass, and the function will be able to handle repeated key=value pairs in form data, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
