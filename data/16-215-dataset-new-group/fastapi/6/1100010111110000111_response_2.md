The core issue with the `request_body_to_args` function appears to be that it is not correctly handling the case of multiple values for a single key in the `received_body` FormData. This causes the validation to fail, resulting in a 422 status code and errors in the responses of the tests.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to modify the function to handle the case when a key in `received_body` has multiple values.
2. We need to merge the values of the repeated keys into a list and assign it to the corresponding field before validation.
3. Update the error handling strategy to ensure that the errors are appended correctly.

With this in mind, below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function to resolve the issue:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            field_alias = field.alias
            values_raw = received_body.getlist(field_alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field_alias)
            value = values_raw if len(values_raw) > 1 else values_raw[0] if len(values_raw) == 1 else None

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field_alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field, ModelField) and hasattr(field, "validate"):
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field_alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

Changes made in the corrected version of the function:
1. Iterate over the `required_params` and extract the respective field_alias.
2. Use `received_body.getlist` to retrieve a list of values for a given field if `received_body` is of type `FormData`. Otherwise, just use `received_body.get`.
3. If multiple values exist, a list is assigned to the corresponding field, otherwise, a single value is assigned.
4. Modify the error handling and append the errors correctly to the `errors` list.

With this corrected version of the function, it should solve the issue mentioned in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

Remember to update the import statements and include the necessary dependencies.
