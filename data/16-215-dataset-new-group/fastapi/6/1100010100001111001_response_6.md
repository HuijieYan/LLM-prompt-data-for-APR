The bug in the function `request_body_to_args` is related to the transformation of the received_body values into the expected values based on its ModelField specifications. The function fails to correctly process the cases where the ModelField's type is different from the type of the received_body value. The cause of the bug is that when processing the received body, the function does not properly consider the shape of the field and the type information for the fields in the `required_params`. Furthermore, a single element list is not accurately handled for this particular case.

To fix the bug, the function should consider the shape and type of the field when processing the received body. If the received body doesn't match the expected shape and type, a validation error should be added to the errors list. Additionally, when single element lists are involved, they should be handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        error_loc = ('body', field.alias)
        if field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body[field.alias]
            try:
                validated_value = field.validate(value, {}, loc=error_loc)
                values[field.name] = validated_value
            except Exception as error:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(error, loc=error_loc))
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=error_loc))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version, for each field in the `required_params`, the function checks whether the field is present in the received_body and then attempts to validate the value based on the field's specifications. If the value does not match the specifications, an error is added to the errors list. This approach ensures that all fields and their corresponding values are properly validated and handled.
