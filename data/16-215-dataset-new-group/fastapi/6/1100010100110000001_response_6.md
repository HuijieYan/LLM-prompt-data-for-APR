## Analysis
The error message shows that the response status code is 422, but the test expects the status code to be 200. This indicates that the function `request_body_to_args` is not handling the form data correctly for python list, set, and tuple types.

## Bug Location
The issue might be in the way the function `request_body_to_args` processes the form data for python list, set, and tuple types.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused due to improper handling of python list, set, and tuple types in form data within the `request_body_to_args` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. We need to ensure that the form data for python list, set, and tuple types is processed correctly.
2. We need to handle the validation and processing of these types according to the requirements of the test cases.

## The Corrected Version
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None and field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```
The corrected version of the function properly retrieves and processes the form data for python list, set, and tuple types. This version should address the bugs and pass the failing tests.
