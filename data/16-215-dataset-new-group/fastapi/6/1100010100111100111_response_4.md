The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function appears to be related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. The function is not correctly converting repeated keys in form data to lists, leading to incorrect validation and test failures.

Looking at the failing test cases, it's clear that the function is not handling the conversion of repeated keys (`'items'`) to lists as expected. The expected behavior should be to create a list of values for each repeated key. Fixing this bug will involve modifying the logic to correctly handle repeated keys in form data.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data by converting them into lists of values and processing the validation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
  
    if received_body is None or not isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        received_body = FormData()

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
      
        if value:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
        else:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version:
- We loop through each `required_params` field and use the `getlist` method of `FormData` to retrieve the list of values for each field.
- We then perform validation on these lists of values for each field and handle missing values accordingly.
- If a field is required and has no value, we append a `MissingError` to the `errors` list.
- If a field is not required and has no value, we assign the `default` value to the corresponding field in the `values` dictionary.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle repeated keys in form data correctly and pass the failing tests.

Please note that this code assumes that the `getlist` method will correctly handle repeated keys in the form data, as described in the GitHub issue. If there are any discrepancies in the behavior of the `getlist` method, additional adjustments may be needed.
