The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to parse the received body and extract values based on required_params. However, there are multiple issues in the implementation that cause it to return incorrect results. The main issues include:

1. Incorrect use of received_body when constructing a dictionary.
2. Improper handling of required but missing fields.
3. Mishandling of sequence shapes.

To fix these issues, the function implementation can be modified as follows:

```python
# Fixed version of the function

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (field.required and value == "")
            or (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected implementation:
1. The dictionary construction logic has been fixed to handle received_body properly and construct the dictionary based on the received values.
2. The handling of required but missing fields has been improved to add MissingError to the errors list when a required field is missing or empty.
3. The sequence shapes are properly handled to read and validate values based on their types and contents.

The fixed function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
