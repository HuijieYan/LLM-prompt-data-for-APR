The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is used to extract values and errors from a request body based on the required params. The bug seems to be related to the handling of form data with repeated keys. The failing test functions, `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`, all demonstrate issues related to form data with non-typing sequences, such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The issue is that when form data contains repeated keys, the function only retrieves and validates the last key=value pair, which is not the expected behavior. The GitHub issue further clarifies the problem and provides a suggested solution to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle form data with repeated keys and ensure that all values associated with repeated keys are collected and validated as a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    if value is None:
                        if field.required:
                            if PYDANTIC_1:
                                errors.append(
                                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                                )
                            else:
                                errors.append(
                                    ErrorWrapper(
                                        MissingError(),
                                        loc=("body", field.alias),
                                        config=BaseConfig,
                                    )
                                )
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                            continue
				
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                    ):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates over each field in the required params and properly retrieves the values from the received body, handling repeated keys by collecting them as lists. Additionally, the function performs the required validation for each field.

This corrected version of the function should address the issue and pass the failing test cases while resolving the problem raised in the GitHub issue.
