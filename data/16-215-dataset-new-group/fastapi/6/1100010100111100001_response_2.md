The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function stems from the incorrect processing of non-typing sequence types (list, set, tuple) received in the `FormData` request and the mismatch in processing the received value to the expected Pydantic field type. 

The following are the identified issues:

1. The `request_body_to_args` function expects the received body to be a dict with keys matching the Pydantic field aliases. However, in the case of non-typing sequence types (list, set, tuple) passed in the form data, the value of the corresponding key should be a list, set or tuple, respectively, rather than a single string.

2. The function doesn't handle non-typing sequence types (list, set, tuple) correctly when they are passed as form data. It tries to process them as strings, resulting in errors when processing non-typing sequence types in form data.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle non-typing sequence types correctly for the received form data and process them accordingly to match the expected Pydantic field types.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                # Updated to handle non-typing sequence types correctly
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape == 3 and isinstance(value, list):
                    value = tuple(value)
                elif field.shape == 4 and isinstance(value, list):
                    value = set(value)
        if value is None and field.required:
            errors.append(
                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            )
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected function, the received non-typing sequence types of list, set, and tuple are processed accurately and validated against the Pydantic field types, resolving the issue with the failing tests.
