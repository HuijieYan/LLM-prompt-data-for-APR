### Identified Bug
The issue is related to handling repeated keys in the form data, which is not being handled correctly in the `request_body_to_args` function. When the same key is repeated in the form data, only the last value is being considered, leading to failed validation and the incorrect status code returned.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of repeated keys in form data within the `request_body_to_args` function. When a key is repeated, only the last value is being considered, leading to validation errors. This is not in line with the expected behavior, which should collect repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle repeated keys in the form data by collecting the values for each key and forming a list before validating the data.

### Corrected Version
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None

            if received_body is not None:
                key = field.alias
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if key in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(key)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(key)

                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", key))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(
                                    MissingError(), loc=("body", key), config=BaseConfig
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function correctly handles repeated keys in the form data by using the `getlist` method to retrieve all values associated with a key when the received body is a `FormData`. This ensures that all values for a repeated key are collected and assigned as a list before validation. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing tests.
