Based on the GitHub issue and the failing tests, it seems that the issue is related to handling repeated key=value pairs in form data. The failing tests are related to handling Python list, set, and tuple as form data input. The error message indicates that the response status code is not as expected, which means the function `request_body_to_args` is not processing the form data correctly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the section where it processes the received body based on the field shape and values. The error may also be related to how it validates the input values for the required parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function `request_body_to_args` does not handle repeated key=value pairs as expected. The failing tests are trying to test for handling list, set, and tuple as form data input, but the function does not process this input correctly, leading to validation errors and incorrect response status codes.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be updated to handle repeated key=value pairs and correctly validate the input values for the required parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args`:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias, None)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `received_body` is handled in a way that supports repeated key=value pairs and correctly processes form data inputs of different types such as list, set, and tuple.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
