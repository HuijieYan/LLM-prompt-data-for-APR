The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing the failing tests due to inconsistent behavior with different sequence types such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is unable to properly handle the input received from these sequence types when they are passed as form data.

The bug is likely caused by the way the function processes received data for different sequence types, resulting in incorrect values being used in further processing and error generation. This inconsistency in handling different sequence types leads to the function failing to validate the input and generate errors when required.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to consistently handle different sequence types, specifically lists, sets, and tuples, when they are passed as form data. This includes correctly processing the received data, validating the values, and generating errors if needed for each sequence type.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if isinstance(field.type_, list):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            elif isinstance(field.type_, set):
                value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias)) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else set([received_body.get(field.alias)])
            elif isinstance(field.type_, tuple):
                value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias)) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else tuple([received_body.get(field.alias)])
            if value is None or value == "" or len(value) == 0:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly handles lists, sets, and tuples as form data, ensuring that the input data is correctly processed and validated for each sequence type. This should address the inconsistent behavior observed in the failing tests and allow the function to correctly validate the input and pass the tests.
