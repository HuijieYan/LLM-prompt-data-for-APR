To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to improve the handling of repeated keys in form data and ensure that multiple keys are correctly processed as lists.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle repeated keys in the received form data correctly, causing validation errors or mismatches between the expected and actual values. The function should be updated to properly support repeated key=value pairs in form data as requested in the GitHub issue.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Check for repeated keys in the form data.
2. If repeated keys are found, collect their values as a list for the same key.
3. Use the collected key-value pairs for validation and return.

Based on the expectations of the buggy function's output and the GitHub issue, we can fix the function. Below is a corrected version of the function.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        # Process repeated keys in form data
        repeated_keys = {}
        for param in required_params:
            value = received_body.getlist(param.alias, [])
            if len(value) > 1:
                repeated_keys[param.alias] = value
        for param in required_params:
            if param.alias in repeated_keys:
                values[param.name] = repeated_keys[param.alias]
                continue
            value = received_body.get(param.alias)
            if value is None and param.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", param.alias)))
            elif value is None and not param.required:
                values[param.name] = deepcopy(param.default)
            else:
                # Continue with the existing validation logic
                field_info = get_field_info(param)
                if field_info.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(param.alias)
                v_, errors_ = param.validate(value, values, loc=("body", param.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[param.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we iterate over the `required_params` to extract values from the `received_body`. If a parameter's value contains multiple elements (which could occur if the same key appears multiple times in the form data), it is collected as a list for that parameter. When handling repeated keys, the function does not need to add any new errors, as validation errors will still occur if the keys were invalid prior. Otherwise, the function proceeds with the existing validation logic.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
