The buggy function `request_body_to_args` fails to correctly handle scenario where the same field name is repeated in request body. This is evident from the failing test cases and the corresponding error messages which indicate a status code 422 instead of 200. 

The main potential error location is in the nested 'for' loop:
```python
for field in required_params:
    value: Any = None
    if received_body is not None:
        if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
            received_body, FormData
        ):
            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
        else:
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
```
Here, when the `field` is not the last item in `required_params` and `field.alias` is repeated in the `received_body`, the `value` isn't correctly updated for the repeated key, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the repeated keys are properly handled and converted into a list of values for the same key before validation happens.

Here is a corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args` with the bug fixed:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    repeat_values = {}
    
    # Iterate through the required params
    for field in required_params:
        # Initialize an empty list to accumulate values for repeated keys
        repeat_values[field.alias] = []
        
    if received_body:
        # Iterate through each key, value pair in the received body
        for key, value in received_body.items():
            if key in repeat_values:
                # If the key is found in repeat_values dict, append the value to the list
                repeat_values[key].append(value)
        
        # Iterate again through the required params to process the accumulated values
        for field in required_params:
            # Check if there are repeated values for the field alias
            if repeat_values[field.alias]:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # If it's a sequence shape, assign the list of values to the field alias
                    value = repeat_values[field.alias]
                else:
                    # If not a sequence shape, assign the last value as the field alias
                    value = repeat_values[field.alias][-1]
            else:
                # If no repeat values, assign value from the received body
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                
            # Rest of the validation logic remains unchanged

            # ...

    return values, errors
```

With the corrected version, the function will correctly handle the repeated keys in the request body, accumulating the values into a list and using the list for validation. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
