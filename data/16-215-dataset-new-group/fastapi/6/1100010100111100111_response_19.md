The issue seems to be related to the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, which is not handling repeated keys correctly in the form data received. From the failing tests and runtime values, the function fails to handle repeated keys in form data when it's received as a list, set, or tuple, resulting in a validation error.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle repeated keys properly when parsing the form data, and it fails to convert the repeated keys into a list, set, or tuple in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle repeated keys correctly. We can update the logic inside the function to check if the received data for a field is a list, set, or tuple, and then convert it into the appropriate data structure. Additionally, the function needs to handle repeated keys correctly and not override the values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        received_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
        if received_value:
            if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, list):
                values[field.alias] = received_value
            elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, set):
                values[field.alias] = set(received_value)
            elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, tuple):
                values[field.alias] = tuple(received_value)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = received_value[0]  # Assume single value for non-sequence types
        elif field.required:
            errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            continue
        else:
            values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly handles repeated keys in form data and converts them into the appropriate data structure based on the type declared for the field. This should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing tests.
