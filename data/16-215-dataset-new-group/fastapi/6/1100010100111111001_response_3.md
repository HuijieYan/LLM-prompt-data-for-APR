The bug in the provided function is in the logic that processes the input data and validates it against the specified fields. Currently, the function doesn't handle nested sequences correctly, leading to incorrect extraction and validation of the values.

The bug triggers the `assert` statements in the failing tests, and the return values of the function don't match the expected output.

The cause of the bug is that when processing the input data (`received_body`), the function doesn't correctly handle nested sequences or typed sequence fields, resulting in incorrect validation and extraction of values.

To fix the bug:

1. We need to correct the handling of sequences in the `received_body` and the `required_params` processing.
2. Use the correct approach to extract, process, and validate the input data based on the type and structure of the fields.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            field_alias = field.alias
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                field_data = received_body[field_alias]
                if isinstance(field_data, list):
                    value = field_data
                else:
                    value = [field_data]
            else:
                value = [field_alias]

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field_alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The corrected function does a better job of extracting and validating the input data against the specified fields, considering the sequence types and correctly processing nested sequences. This should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
