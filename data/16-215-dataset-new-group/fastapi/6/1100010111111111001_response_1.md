To fix the buggy function, we need to update the logic for handling the different types of parameters (list, set, and tuple) being passed as form data. We also need to modify the logic to appropriately handle the received body data and create values and errors based on the data.

First, let's identify the cause of the bug. Looking at the provided runtime variable values inside the buggy function and the expected values during the failing test execution, it seems that the logic for handling different types of parameters and received body data is not correctly assigning values and errors. The current logic does not account for the sequences of items present in the FormData, leading to incorrect values and errors being generated.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the received body data based on the type of the parameter (list, set, or tuple) and its corresponding field type. Additionally, we need to ensure that values and errors are created correctly based on the received body data.

Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default) if field.default is not None else None
                if (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                ):
                    if isinstance(value, list):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    else:
                        value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the logic for handling different types of parameters and their corresponding received body data. We also ensured that values and errors are created based on the received body data and the field types.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
