### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the `request_body_to_args` function which is not handling the scenario where the form data contains repeated keys that should be assigned to a list.

The failing tests are indicating that the response status code is 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected 200. This indicates that the request body is not being processed correctly, resulting in validation errors.

The GitHub issue also indicates that the expected behavior is to collect repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list. This behavior is not currently supported by the `request_body_to_args` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely occurs within the logic that processes the `received_body` parameter and its interaction with the `required_params` list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `request_body_to_args` function not correctly handling form data with repeated keys, which prevents correct validation and handling of form data lists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and to assign those values as a list to the respective keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData) and isinstance(received_body[field.alias], list):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    value = value if len(value) > 1 else value[0]  # If list has only one item, take it as a single value
            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the `required_params` and check if the field alias is present in the `received_body`. If the alias is present and it is a list, we get the list of values for that alias. Then, we validate and assign the values to the `values` dictionary. This updated logic supports repeated keys in the form data and assigns them as a list, ensuring correct validation of the form data lists.

With this correction, the `request_body_to_args` function should handle the repeated keys in form data correctly and pass the failing tests, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
