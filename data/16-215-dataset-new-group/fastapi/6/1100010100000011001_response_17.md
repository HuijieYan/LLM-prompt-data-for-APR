The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to take a list of `required_params` and a `received_body` as input and convert it into values and errors. However, there are issues in the function where it is not correctly validating the received body against the required parameters, leading to incorrect values and errors being returned.

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Incorrect handling and validation of the received body against the required parameters.
2. Mistakes in generating errors and processing the values based on field types.
3. Incorrect reusing of the `field` variable leading to potential misinterpretation of field info.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling various scenarios of received body and required parameters, leading to incorrect errors and values being generated.

To fix the bug, consider restructuring the function's logic to ensure that it handles different types of required parameters and received bodies correctly, validates them against each other, and generates errors and values accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
            isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
            and field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and len(value) == 0
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle different types of required parameters and received bodies properly, validate them accurately, and generate errors and values as per the expectations.
