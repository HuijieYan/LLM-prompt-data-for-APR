## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The handling of repeated keys in the form data might be causing the issue, as the function does not seem to handle multiple values for the same key properly.
2. The check for sequence shapes and the handling of `FormData` might not be working as expected for repeated keys in the form data.

## Cause of the bug
The bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of repeated keys in the form data. When the form data contains repeated keys (e.g., `items: ["first", "second", "third"]`), the `request_body_to_args` function is not correctly processing these repeated keys and only taking the last value instead of creating a list of values. As a result, the test cases fail with a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function should be modified to properly handle repeated keys in the form data. If a key appears multiple times in the form data, the function should aggregate the values into a list for that key and then process it accordingly.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Handling repeated keys in form data
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
            )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function handles repeated keys in the form data by checking if the field alias is present in the received body and using `getlist` to retrieve all values for that key. Additionally, it skips the processing if the value is empty or if it's missing.

With this correction, the function should be able to properly handle repeated keys in the form data and pass the failing test cases, resolving the GitHub issue.
