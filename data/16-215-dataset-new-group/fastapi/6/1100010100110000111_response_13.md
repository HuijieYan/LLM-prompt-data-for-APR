The issue is related to the way FastAPI handles repeated key-value pairs in form data. The problem is that when data is sent with repeated keys like `items=["first", "second", "third"]`, only the last key-value pair is considered, and the rest of the repeated values are lost.

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` processes the received_body and required_params to extract the values and handle errors. This function does not handle repeated key-value pairs properly, causing the tests to fail with a 422 status code instead of 200.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic within the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys for form data.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if value is not None and len(value) == 1:
            value = value[0]

        # Rest of the code remains the same

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we loop through the `required_params` and check if a field with a sequence shape is present in the form data. If it is, we use `getlist` to retrieve all values associated with the field's alias. We then process these values accordingly.

This change should fix the bug by properly handling repeated key-value pairs in the form data and ensuring that all values are considered for validation.

With this change, the tests should now pass with a 200 status code, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
