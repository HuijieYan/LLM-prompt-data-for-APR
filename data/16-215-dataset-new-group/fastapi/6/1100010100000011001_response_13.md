Based on the expected values and types of variables, it seems that the issue lies in the way the function is handling the `required_params` and the `received_body` to generate the `values` output and the `errors` output. It seems that there is an issue when shaping the `received_body` dictionary and handling the required parameters in the list.

The value variable should be assigned to `received_body[field.alias]` instead of `received_body.get(field.alias)` to cater for the first and second cases of how the function is processed. Similarly, when assigning value to received_body[field.alias], it should consider if the value is None or empty and then assign the appropriate default or add an error as appropriate.

Another issue can be seen in how `field_info` is being used. There are several if-else statements referring to `field_info` without clearly defining it within the context of the function. It's important to check the value of `field_info` and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior when processing the `required_params`.

1. The function should explicitly check that `field_info` is either an instance of `params.Form` or `params.File` and handle each case separately.
2. Ensure that the assignments of `value` and `received_body` align with the expectations in each case.
3. Return the `values` and `errors` once all required_params have been processed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors

```
