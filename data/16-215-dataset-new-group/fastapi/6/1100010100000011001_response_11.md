The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to process the received body and extract values based on the required parameters, while also catching and storing any errors that occur during the process. However, there are a few identified issues with the current implementation that may lead to unexpected behavior.

1. In the loop within the function, the `received_body` variable is being reassigned based on the `field.alias`, which could potentially cause data loss or incorrect assignment.

2. The error handling for missing required fields or incorrect types may not be behaving as expected, as there is a mix of conditions to handle these cases which can make it harder to maintain and debug.

To fix these issues, the function can be rewritten to avoid reassigning `received_body` and to simplify the error handling logic. Additionally, the fields can be extracted from the required parameters list and looped through to check for errors and extract values.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version:
- The loop iterates through each field in the `required_params` list and extracts the value from the `received_body` based on the field's alias.
- If the value is None, the function checks if the field is required and adds an error if it is missing. Otherwise, it assigns the default value to the `values` dictionary.
- If the value is not None, it goes through the validation process similar to the original function. Any errors are added to the `errors` list, and the validated value is added to the `values` dictionary.

The corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values for all provided cases.
