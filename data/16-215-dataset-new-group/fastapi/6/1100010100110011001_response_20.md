## Analysis
The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 when it should be 200. This suggests that the validation for the request body to arguments is failing, leading to an incorrect response status code.

The bug seems to be related to the validation of request parameters, specifically when the received body is a form and the required_params include non-typing sequences such as a list, a set, or a tuple. The bug is likely to be in the validation logic when handling these non-typing sequences.

The buggy function should extract the values from the received body and validate them against the required parameters to ensure that the required data is present and that the data is of the correct type.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle non-typing sequences when they are part of the request body, ensuring that values are extracted and validated properly.

## Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and not value)
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias)
                        )
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = field.default
                continue

            if (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            ):
                if not isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    value = [value]
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function correctly handles non-typing sequences when they are part of the request body, ensuring that values are extracted and validated properly. This should address the bug and ensure that the response status code is 200 as expected.
