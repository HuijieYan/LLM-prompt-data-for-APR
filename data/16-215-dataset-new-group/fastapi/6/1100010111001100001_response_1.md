The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is designed to extract values from a request body and validate them against a list of required parameters. However, the bug seems to be occurring when handling non-typing sequences (such as lists, sets, and tuples) as form data in the request body. This is evident from the failing test cases for list, set, and tuple parameters.

The identified potential error locations are:
1. The way the function handles the received_body for non-typing sequence parameters.
2. The validation logic for non-typing sequence parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling non-typing sequence parameters correctly when they are submitted as form data in the request body, leading to validation errors and incorrect values being returned.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic for extracting and handling non-typing sequences from the received request body.
2. Ensure that the validation logic properly handles non-typing sequence parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 0)
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else: 
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling non-typing sequences is updated to extract values correctly from the received request body. Additionally, the validation logic is adjusted to handle non-typing sequence parameters appropriately.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests provided.
