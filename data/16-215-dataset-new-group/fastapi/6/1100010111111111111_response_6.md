The buggy function `request_body_to_args` appears to be incorrectly handling repeated keys in form data, causing the failing tests. The issue arises when multiple values are associated with the same key in form data. The function fails to collect the repeated keys and assign their values as a list before validation.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling repeated keys in form data when converting request body to arguments for validation. This results in the last value for a repeated key winning over the previous values, leading to incorrect validation and error handling.

To fix the bug, a strategy should be to modify the function so that it correctly collects repeated keys in form data and assigns those values as a list before validation happens. This will align with the expectations defined in the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body is not None:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body[field.alias]
                if value:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function handles the form data properly by checking the repeated keys, collecting them into a list, and then validating the list of values for the associated field. This approach ensures that the function is able to validate the form data correctly, avoiding the issue seen in the failing tests and resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
