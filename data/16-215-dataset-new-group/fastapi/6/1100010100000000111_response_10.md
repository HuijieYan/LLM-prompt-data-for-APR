### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub suggests that FastAPI is not handling repeated keys in form data as expected. The current implementation of the `request_body_to_args` function does not seem to handle repeated keys in form data properly. It only considers the last value for a key and does not process repeated keys as a list.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of repeated keys in form data.
2. Processing of form data values for each field.

### Cause of the Bug:
The current implementation of the `request_body_to_args` function does not handle repeated keys in form data properly. It only considers the last value for a key and does not process repeated keys as a list. This causes issues when validating form data with repeated keys.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. This includes collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: fastapi/dependencies/utils.py

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Handle repeated keys as list
                    if field.alias in received_body.keys():
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                # remaining code
            # remaining code
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version, we handle repeated keys in the form data by specifically checking for the presence of the key in the form data and getting the list of values instead of just a single value. This ensures that all values for a repeated key are collected and processed as a list before validation happens.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug by properly supporting repeated key=value in form data.
