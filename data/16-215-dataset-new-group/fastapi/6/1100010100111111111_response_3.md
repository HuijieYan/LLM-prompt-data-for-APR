## Correction:

To fix the issue, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.alias], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if errors_:
                errors.append(errors_)
    return values, errors

```

In this corrected version, when iterating through the `required_params`, the function grabs the corresponding value from the `received_body` and assigns it as a list to the key in the `values` dictionary. Then, it validates the value against the field and appends any errors to the `errors` list.

This updated function properly handles repeated keys in form data and assigns those values as a list before validation.

This correction should resolve the GitHub issue and also ensure that the failing tests pass with the correct status code (200).
