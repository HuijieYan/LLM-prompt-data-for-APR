The function `request_body_to_args` is intended to process a request body and map the received parameters to the required parameters specified by the `required_params` list. However, there are potential error locations within the function, including handling for missing or invalid values, as well as potential issues with file uploads.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it does not properly handle the case where the received body is None or the values are missing. Additionally, there are issues with handling file uploads and validating the values.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Properly checking for missing or invalid values and handling them appropriately.
2. Improving the handling of file uploads and validation of the values.
3. Ensuring that the required parameters are correctly mapped to the received body.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
            value = received_body[field.alias]

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                value = await value.read()
            elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through each `required_params` field and check if it exists in the `received_body`. If it exists, we proceed with validation and processing. Additionally, we handle file uploads and validation of the values based on the field information. This should address the potential issues and improve the overall functionality of the `request_body_to_args` function.
