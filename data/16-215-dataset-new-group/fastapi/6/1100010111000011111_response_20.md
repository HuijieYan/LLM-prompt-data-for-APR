## Correction
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is failing to handle repeated keys in form data, causing it to validate only the last value. This is contrary to the expected behavior and has been reported as an issue on GitHub, where a suggested solution is to collect repeated keys in a 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle repeated keys in form data correctly, ensuring that it collects all values for the same key and assigns them to a list before validation.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(value) == 1:
                    value = value[0]
                if field.required:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value
            elif field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

This corrected function handles the issue of repeated keys in form data by checking if the `received_body` is a `FormData`, and if so, collecting all the values for the same key and assigning them to a list before validation.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing tests are now passing.
