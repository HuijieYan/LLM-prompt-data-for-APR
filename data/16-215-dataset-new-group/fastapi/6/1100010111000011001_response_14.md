The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has an issue related to processing non-typing sequences (e.g., list, set, tuple) as form data. It fails to handle these types correctly, leading to the failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly processes non-typing sequences as form data, resulting in errors and incorrect values being returned.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle non-typing sequences as form data correctly and ensure that the correct values are returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]
                if value is None and field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we loop through each field in the `required_params` and check if the field alias exists in the `received_body`. If it does, we assign the corresponding value to the `value` variable. If the `value` is still None and the field is required, we append a `MissingError` to the `errors` list.

This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases related to non-typing sequences as form data.
