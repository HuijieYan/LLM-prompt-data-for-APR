The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the `sequence_shapes` and `sequence_types` for different types of fields. The function is not correctly validating the received body for sequence-shaped fields such as lists, sets, and tuples. It also fails to correctly initialize the value variable in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the field types and their shapes, as well as the expected values within the received body, based on the field's shape and type. Additionally, we need to ensure that the value is correctly initialized for each field.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = None
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    if field.shape:
                        shape_type = sequence_shape_to_type.get(field.shape)
                        if shape_type and isinstance(received_body[field.alias], shape_type):
                            value = received_body[field.alias]
                        else:
                            try:
                                value = shape_type(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                            except:
                                pass
                    else:
                        value = received_body[field.alias]

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, e = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(e, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(e)
                elif isinstance(e, list):
                    errors.extend(e)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that we correctly handle the different shape types and initialize the value variable appropriately. Additionally, we properly validate the field value and handle any potential errors.
