## Analyzing the bug and GitHub issue

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` seems to be related to the issue reported in GitHub, "Support repeated key=value in form data". The issue describes that FastAPI does not collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that `request.form()` gives, and it only validates against the last value. This results in failing tests when trying to post form data with repeated keys.

The failing tests indicate a status code of 422 (unprocessable entity) instead of the expected status code 200 (OK) when posting form data with repeating keys ('items') as lists, sets, or tuples.

## Potential error locations

The potential error locations in the `request_body_to_args` function are:
1. The handling of form data with repeated keys might not be collecting all values as a list before validation.
2. The validation process might not be correctly handling repeated keys and their associated values.

## Cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that the `request_body_to_args` function is not correctly handling repeated keys in the form data. When the form data contains repeated keys, the function is not collecting all values of the repeated keys as a list before validation. This results in only the last key=value pair being validated, leading to the failing tests.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `request_body_to_args` function to collect all values of repeated keys in the form data as a list before validation. This will ensure that all values associated with the repeated keys are included in the validation process.

## The corrected version

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if value is None:
                        value = []
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value += received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias)
                            )
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
``` 

In the corrected version, additional checks have been added to collect all values of repeated keys in the form data as a list before validation. This addresses the bug reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
