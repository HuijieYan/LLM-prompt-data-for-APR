The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing the failing tests to return a 422 status code instead of the expected 200 status code. The bug is in the logic that handles the input bodies for lists, sets, and tuples. The function incorrectly processes the received data, leading to incorrect values for the `values` output and incorrect ordering of the `response.status_code`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the different shapes of request bodies correctly. It fails to parse the values from the received body and assign the correct values to the `values` dictionary. This results in the failing tests with unexpected status codes.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse and validate the values of request bodies based on their shape (list, set, tuple) and assign them to the `values` dictionary. Additionally, the function should handle form data and ensure that it correctly processes the received data to match the expected types.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None

        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(field.type_, list) and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, each required parameter from the `required_params` list is processed individually, and the received values are validated and assigned to the `values` dictionary based on their shape. This ensures that the correct values are extracted and validated for different types of request bodies.
