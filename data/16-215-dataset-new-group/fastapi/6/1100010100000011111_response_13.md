To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to update the logic for handling repeated keys in form data and ensure that the function correctly handles the required_params and received_body inputs.

The issue on GitHub suggests that FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that request.form() gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This means that when multiple values are received with the same key in the form data, they should be collected into a list and assigned to the same key.

We need to update the function to correctly handle repeated keys when parsing the received_body.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if values[field.name] is not None:
                # If the value is a list, convert it to a single value or validate each item separately
                if field.shape in [List, Tuple] and isinstance(values[field.name], list):
                    if field.sub_fields:
                        for i, item in enumerate(values[field.name]):
                            v_, errors_ = field.validate(item, values, loc=("body", field.alias, i))
                            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                                errors.append(errors_)
                            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                                errors.extend(errors_)
                            else:
                                values[field.name][i] = v_
                    else:
                        if len(field.sub_fields) == 1:
                            sub_field = field.sub_fields[0]
                            awaitables = [sub_field.validate(item, values, loc=("body", field.alias, i)) for i, item in enumerate(values[field.name])]
                            validations = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                            errors.extend([err for val, err in validations])
                            values[field.name] = [val for val, err in validations]

                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first iterate over the required_params and fetch the corresponding values from the received_body using the field.alias as the key. If the value is not None, we then handle the case for repeated keys by converting the list of values into a single value when the field is not a list or tuple. When the field is a list or tuple, we validate each item separately and handle any validations or errors accordingly. We also handle the case when a field is required but is missing in the received_body.

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle repeated keys in form data and validate the received_body against the required_params. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
