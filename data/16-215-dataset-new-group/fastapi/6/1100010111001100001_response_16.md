The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to the way it processes non-typing sequences (lists, sets, tuples) received in form data. The function is failing to correctly transform them into the expected types when received as form data. This can be observed from the failing tests for the `python-list`, `python-set`, and `python-tuple` parameters when sending form data.

The potential error location is within the code block where the function processes the received data and attempts to convert it to the expected data types based on the field type. It seems that the function does not handle non-typing sequences correctly when they are received as form data.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the logic for handling non-typing sequences in the form data, ensuring that they are transformed into the expected data types (list, set, tuple) based on the field type.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import cast, Optional, Dict, Any, Tuple, List

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {list, set, tuple}
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                alias = field.alias
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(alias)
                    value = cast(Any, value)  # Use cast to avoid type-checking issues
                    if field.type_ is not None:
                        value = field.type_(value)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                # Error handling logic remains the same
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # Validation and error handling remains the same
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through the required params and checks if the received form data is a non-typing sequence (list, set, tuple). If it is, it properly converts the received data into the expected data type using `field.type_`. Then, it continues with the validation and error handling logic. This should address the issue of non-typing sequences not being correctly transformed into the expected types, leading to passing the failing tests mentioned earlier.
