Based on the GitHub issue and the provided buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for parsing required parameters from the received body, but it does not handle repeated key=value pairs correctly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the logic that extracts values from the received body and the validation process for those values.

The cause of the bug is that when the function encounters repeated key=value pairs in form data, it only captures the last key=value pair instead of collecting all values into a list, which is the expected behavior according to the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to handle repeated key=value pairs correctly and collect all values into a list for the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)

        if not value:
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                value = [await v.read() if isinstance(v, UploadFile) else v for v in value]

            v, err = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(err, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(err)
            elif isinstance(err, list):
                errors.extend(err)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the required_params and retrieves the values for each field. When encountering repeated key=value pairs, it correctly collects all values into a list for the same key. It also handles the validation of these values, ensuring that the expected behavior from the GitHub issue is addressed.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and handle repeated key=value pairs in form data as expected.
