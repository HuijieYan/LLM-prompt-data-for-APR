The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is that it incorrectly handles different types of data structures for the `items` field. The function tries to convert the received data into the appropriate type based on the `field.shape` and the field's type. However, the logic is flawed, leading to incorrect handling and validation of the received data.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to refactor the logic for handling different data structures and their validation. This can be achieved by creating separate branches for different field types and shapes and performing the necessary conversion and validation based on these factors.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple)):
                        value = [field.type_.__args__[0](v) for v in value]
                elif field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through each `required_params` field and checks if the `field.alias` is present in the received body. If it is present, it retrieves the value and performs type conversion and validation based on the field's type and shape. If the field is required and missing in the received body, an error is added to the `errors` list. Finally, the function returns the `values` and `errors`.

With this correction, the function should handle different types and shapes of data for the required parameters, and perform the necessary conversion and validation, producing accurate results.
