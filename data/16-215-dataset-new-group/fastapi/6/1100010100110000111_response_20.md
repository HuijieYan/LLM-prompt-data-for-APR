The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely related to handling repeated keys in form data, as indicated by the failing test cases and the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value in form data.

The bug might be occurring when the function handles repeated keys in form data and does not properly assign those values as a list before validation. This leads to validation against only the last value, causing the failing test cases and related issue.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys and assign those values as a list before validation. This can be achieved by properly parsing and handling repeated keys in the `request_body_to_args` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    # Handle repeated keys as a list
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, when handling repeated keys in form data, the function checks for the presence of the field's alias in the received body and retrieves the values as a list using the `getlist` method. This allows proper handling of repeated keys as a list before validation.

After making this change, the function should be able to handle repeated key=value in form data and pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
