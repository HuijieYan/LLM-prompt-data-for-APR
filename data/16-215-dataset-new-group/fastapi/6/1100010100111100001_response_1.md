The bug arises from an incorrect assumption around handling the received body when the parameter is a non-typing sequence (list, set, tuple).

The strategy to fix the bug involves:
1. Understanding the structure and data types of the received body when handling non-typing sequences.
2. Correctly transforming the received body into the expected dictionary format for the given non-typing sequence parameter.
3. Ensuring that the input values are properly handled and validated by the function.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if field.shape is not None and isinstance(field.shape, int):
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
                if embed:
                    values[field.name] = received_body
                elif isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape > 0:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        values[field.name] = value
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                        values[field.name] = value
            elif received_body is not None:
                if field.shape == 0:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
    return values, errors
```

With the corrected version, the function should now correctly handle non-typing sequence parameters and avoid the issues that led to the failing tests.
