Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `request_body_to_args` is not handling the scenario where we have repeated keys in form data properly. It is mentioned in the GitHub issue that FastAPI should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

I suggest fixing the bug by modifying the function to handle repeated keys in form data and process them as a list before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Use getlist to handle repeated keys
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have modified the section where `value` is retrieved from the `received_body` to handle repeated keys in form data by using the `getlist` method. In case of repeated keys, `getlist` returns a list of all values associated with that key, which ensures that the repeated keys are processed as a list before validation.

With this corrected function, the failing tests related to handling repeated keys in form data should pass, and it should also address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
