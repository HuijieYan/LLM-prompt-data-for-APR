The issue seems to be related to the fact that FastAPI is not handling repeated key/value pairs in form data as expected when using `Form` in the `request_body_to_args` function.

The bug in the current function is that it is not correctly handling the case where the same key is repeated multiple times in the form data. It seems to be only considering the last value for a key while it should collect all the values for a repeated key and assign them as a list before validation.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the function to properly handle repeated key/value pairs in form data. We need to create a list for the values of repeated keys before performing the validation and populating the `values` dictionary.

Based on the expected behavior and the provided implementation, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if received_body and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            
            # validate each value
            for value in values[field.name]:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
                    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we loop through the required fields and get the list of values for each key from the `FormData` object. Then, we validate each value and populate the `values` dictionary with the validated values. This will ensure that we correctly handle repeated key/value pairs in the form data and produce the expected output for the given input parameters.
