To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue identified in the failing tests and the corresponding GitHub issue. Specifically, the `request_body_to_args` function should handle repeated keys in form data as lists in the request context.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the scenario when a parameter is passed as a list, set, or tuple in form data. It's not correctly treating these inputs as lists, sets, or tuples, which leads to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `request_body_to_args` function to correctly handle inputs passed as lists, sets, or tuples in form data. This means parsing the form data correctly and transforming it into the expected values for the models being validated.

Given the analysis, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

                if field.shape == 2:
                    value = value if value else [None]

                # Validate files
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, ModelField)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, Sequence[UploadFile])
                ):
                    contents = [await v.read() for v in value]
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function includes the necessary logic to correctly handle requests with repeated keys in form data. It loops through the required parameters and correctly validates the input values based on the field type and shape.

By doing so, this corrected version should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub thread where repeated keys in the form data should be collected as lists before validation.
