The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the input types, particularly for lists, sets, and tuples when received as form data. The logic to handle these non-primitive types results in incorrect values and types of the variables, causing the failing tests.

In each case, the expected behavior is for the values of `required_params` and `received_body` to be properly handled. For example, dictionaries should be properly parsed when `received_body` is a `FormData` object.

To fix the buggy function, we need to appropriately handle the cases for lists, sets, and tuples as form data and ensure that values are being extracted and cast correctly based on their expected data types.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function which should satisfy the expected input/output values and the failing tests:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    alias = field.name
                    if alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body[alias]
                        if field.type_ in (list, set, tuple):
                            if not isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple)):
                                value = [value]
                            value = field.type_(value)
                    else:
                        value = field.default
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = field.default
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, each field from `required_params` is handled individually based on its data type and whether it is present in the `received_body`. The code ensures that each field's value is properly extracted from `received_body` and converted to the correct type if necessary. Additionally, missing data will result in an appropriate error. This corrected version is expected to handle the input types correctly and resolve the failing tests.
