Based on the failing test cases and the provided code, the bug seems to be related to the handling of input data for the "items" field when it is a list, set, or tuple. The current code may not correctly handle these non-typing sequences when passed as form data.

The observed bug in the failing test cases is that despite the expected HTTP status code 200, the actual status code returned is 422.

Considering the specific cases:

Case 1:
- The test data contains a list of items passed as form data.
- The values become key-value pairs in the FormData object.
- The current code incorrectly processes the data, resulting in the HTTP status code 422 instead of 200.

Case 2:
- Similar to Case 1, but with a set type.
- The current code incorrectly processes the data, resulting in the wrong HTTP status code.

Case 3:
- Similar to Case 1, but with a tuple type.
- The current code incorrectly processes the data, resulting in the wrong HTTP status code.

Given these observations, to fix the bug:
- We need to ensure that the function correctly handles non-typing sequences (lists, sets, tuples) when received as form data.
- The function should extract the list of items correctly and return the expected HTTP status code.

Considering these points, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape == 1 and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body[field.alias]

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

The corrected version includes:
- A simplified handling of form data to extract the value of the field.alias based on the field shape.
- Direct validation and processing of the value for each field.
- Proper addition of errors if necessary.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
