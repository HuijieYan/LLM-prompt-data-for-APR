The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has a few issues that need to be addressed. It seems that the function is not handling repeated keys in form data correctly, as evident from the failing test cases for list, set, and tuple parameters.

There are potential error locations in the following areas:
1. The logic for handling repeated keys in the `received_body` dictionary is not correctly updating the value for the same key, resulting in only the last value being stored for that key.
2. The conditional checks for different field shapes and types are not handling repeated keys appropriately, leading to incorrect validation and ultimately an incorrect result.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle repeated keys in the form data correctly. As a result, the final values extracted from the form data do not match the expected values, leading to failing the test cases for list, set, and tuple parameters.

The solution for fixing this bug involves updating the logic for handling repeated keys in the `received_body` dictionary, ensuring that all values for the same key are correctly stored as a list before validation. Additionally, the conditional checks for different field shapes and types should be updated to consider the possibility of repeated keys and handle them appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
    ) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
        values = {}
        errors = []
        if required_params:
            for field in required_params:
                values[field.name] = None
                if received_body is not None:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData
                    ):
                        values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if values[field.name] is None and not field.required:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(values[field.name], Sequence):
                        values[field.name] = [
                            await value.read() for value in values[field.name]
                        ]
                    elif isinstance(values[field.name], UploadFile):
                        values[field.name] = await values[field.name].read()
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
        return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle repeated keys in the form data correctly and pass the failing test cases for list, set, and tuple parameters. The function ensures that all values for the same key are correctly stored as a list before validation and that the conditional checks for different field shapes and types properly handle repeated keys and validate the values.
