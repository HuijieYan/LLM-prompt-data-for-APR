Based on the expected values, it seems that the function is not handling sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples correctly. The function is also not creating the expected errors when the required fields are missing or have incorrect types.

The potential error locations in the function are around the handling of sequence shapes and the validation of values against the field definitions.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of sequence shapes when processing the received body, as well as the incorrect generation of error wrappers for missing or invalid fields.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle sequence shapes and generate error wrappers for missing or invalid fields.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or value == "":
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we loop through each required field, handle the sequence shapes properly, and generate error wrappers for missing or invalid fields.
