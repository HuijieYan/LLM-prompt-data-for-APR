The buggy function is the `request_body_to_args` function. The function takes a list of required parameters and a received body as input, and returns a dictionary of values and a list of errors. The function processes each parameter according to its type and shape, and validates the received body against the required parameters.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables at the function's return, it seems the function is correctly processing the received body and generating the appropriate values and errors. Therefore, the bug may not be related to the function's processing logic.

The bug might be related to the construction of the input `required_params` and `received_body` or its interaction with the `get_field_info` function.

To fix the bug, verify that the input `required_params` is being constructed correctly. Ensure that the `received_body` is in the expected format and type to match the required parameters. Additionally, check if the `get_field_info` function is returning the correct `field_info` for each parameter.

Based on this analysis, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function directly processes each parameter in the `required_params` list based on its type and shape. It removes the dependency on `get_field_info` and simplifies the validation and error handling logic.
