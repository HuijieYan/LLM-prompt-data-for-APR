The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function arises from the logic that handles the case when the `received_body` parameter is a `FormData` object and the `required_params` list contains only one item. The bug occurs with the `embed` attribute when trying to reconstruct the parameters.

Based on the runtime values, we can see that the `received_body` is a `FormData` object containing multiple items with the same key ('items'). This should result in a list, set, or tuple, depending on the field's type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic that handles the `received_body` when `embed` is not present. We also need to correctly handle the cases of lists, sets, and tuples.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        
        if hasattr(received_body, "keys"):  # Check if received_body is a dictionary
            received_body = dict(received_body)
        
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            
            if received_body is not None:
                # Handle when multiple items for the same key are present
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is not None:  # Check if value exists before processing
                if field.shape in (1, 7, 30):  # Check for list, set, or tuple
                    value = field.shape((value,))  # Create list, set, or tuple from value
                elif field.shape == 9:  # Check for bytes
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
            
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
                
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function handles the reconstruction of parameters correctly, based on the field's type and the received body. It also handles the different shapes such as lists, sets, tuples, and bytes.
