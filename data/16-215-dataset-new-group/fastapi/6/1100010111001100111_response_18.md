The potential error in the code seems to be related to how the function handles repeated keys in the form data. As per the GitHub issue, the current implementation only validates the last value of repeated keys, instead of collecting all the values into a list.

To fix the bug, the function should collect all repeated keys and their values into a list and then perform validation against the collected values.

Here's a corrected version of the function that should address the issue and resolve the failing tests:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    values[field.name] = [value] if value is not None else []
                for i, item in enumerate(values[field.name]):
                    if (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and isinstance(item, UploadFile)
                    ):
                        value = await item.read()
                        values[field.name][i] = value
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and resolve the failing tests.
