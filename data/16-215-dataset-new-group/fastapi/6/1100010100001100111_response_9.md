The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data. The function is not correctly handling the case where the same key appears multiple times in the form data, resulting in only the last key=value pair being captured.

A potential error location is the section of code that handles the form data and extracts values based on the field aliases.

The cause of the bug is that when the same key appears multiple times in the form data, the function is not capturing all the values and converting them into a list, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                # handle missing or empty values
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                if lenient_issubclass(field.type_, list):
                    values[field.name] = value
                else:
                    values[field.name] = value[0] if isinstance(value, list) else value  # capture the first value
              
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we iterate through each field and appropriately handle repeated keys in form data. If the type of the field is a list, we assign the values as a list to the same key. Otherwise, we capture the first value as before. This modification addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and should now correctly handle repeated keys in form data.
