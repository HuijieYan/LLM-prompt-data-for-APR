The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in FormData. This issue is also reflected in the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data". In the current implementation, the function does not correctly handle repeated keys in the FormData, leading to the incorrect handling of values for required_params with a shape that supports multiple values (e.g., list, set, tuple).

The buggy function incorrectly handles repeated keys in the FormData, and it does not correctly map these repeated keys to a list (or other suitable collection type) before validation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle repeated keys in the FormData and map them to the appropriate collection type for validation.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(value) == 1:
                    value = value[0]
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we iterate through the required_params and handle repeated keys in the FormData using the `getlist()` method. If there is only one value for a repeated key, we retrieve that value instead of a list. This ensures that the values are correctly mapped and validated for the corresponding field.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle repeated key=value pairs in the FormData and support validation for fields with a shape that allows multiple values.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function works as expected.
