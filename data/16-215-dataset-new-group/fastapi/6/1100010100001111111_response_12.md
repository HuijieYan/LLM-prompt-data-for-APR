## Correction

The issue appears to be related to how the function handles repeated keys in form data. The function currently only considers the last value for a repeated key, which is not consistent with the expected behavior of FastAPI as per the GitHub issue.

To fix this issue, a strategy for handling repeated keys in form data should be implemented. This could involve modifying the function to collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation.

Here's a corrected version of the function that attempts to handle repeated keys in form data:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                value: Any = None
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

                if value is not None:
                    if field.required:
                        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                            errors.append(errors_)
                        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                            errors.extend(errors_)
                        else:
                            values[field.name] = v_
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = value

                elif field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig)
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through the required parameters, retrieves values for each parameter from the received body, and attempts to validate those values. If a value is not found, it handles the missing value based on whether the field is required or not. If a value is found, it attempts to validate the value against the field's validation rules.

This version of the function should provide more consistent handling of repeated keys in form data and align with the expected behavior discussed in the GitHub issue.
