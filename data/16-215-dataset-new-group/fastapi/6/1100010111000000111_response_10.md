The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert the form data received by a POST request into a dictionary of values and a list of errors. However, there are several potential error locations:
1. Handling of sequences such as Python lists, sets, and tuples may not work correctly.
2. Handling of repeated keys in form data may not be implemented.

The cause of the bug is that the `request_body_to_args` function does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly, and it does not properly process sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples from form data. This is causing the failing tests for handling Python lists, sets, and tuples as form data to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle repeated keys in form data and process sequences as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body[field.alias], list
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body[field.alias]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, we check if the `field.alias` is present in the `received_body`. If it is, we handle sequences correctly using `getlist` for lists and processing the values accordingly. We also validate the values for each field correctly and accumulate the errors.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and make the failing test cases pass.
