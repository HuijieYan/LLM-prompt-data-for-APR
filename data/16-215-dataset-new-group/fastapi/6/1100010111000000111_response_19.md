Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `request_body_to_args` function is not handling form data with repeated keys as expected, leading to validation errors. The issue in the function appears to be related to how it handles repeated keys in the form data and how it populates the `values` and `errors` variables. The failing tests indicate that when receiving form data with repeated keys, the function is not correctly populating the values and is failing validation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to correctly handle form data with repeated keys and ensure that it populates the `values` and `errors` variables accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    processed_fields = set()
    if received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias in received_body and field not in processed_fields:
                value: Union[str, List[str]] = received_body.getlist(
                    field.alias
                ) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(
                    field.alias
                )
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                            )
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    if (
                        field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                        and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                        and all(isinstance(item, UploadFile) for item in value)
                    ):
                        value = [
                            await item.read()
                            for item in value
                        ]
                        if lenient_issubclass(
                            field.sub_type_, bytes
                        ):  # pragma: no cover
                            value = cast(List[bytes], value)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                processed_fields.add(field)
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function, we iterate over the required parameters and check if the field's alias is present in the received body. If it is, we proceed to process the value based on the field's details. We also use a set `processed_fields` to keep track of fields that have been processed to avoid duplicates. This correction should address the issue with form data handling and ensure that the function correctly populates the `values` and `errors` variables.

This corrected version should resolve the problem described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
