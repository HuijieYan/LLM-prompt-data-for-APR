## The analysis of the buggy function and the failing test
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` takes in a list of required ModelField objects and a received_body, which is either a Dict or FormData. It processes the received_body to extract the values for the required parameters and validate them.

From the failing test message, it appears that the function is not correctly parsing the received data for the input parameter items, which suggests that the function is not handling non-typing sequences properly. This could be related to an issue with parsing and validating non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple).

Looking at the expected values and types of the variables during the execution of the function, we can observe the following:
- In all the cases, the expected errors are related to ListError, SetError, and TupleError for items not being correctly handled by the function.

Given this analysis, it seems that the buggy function is not correctly handling non-typing sequences when processing the received data.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to ensure that it correctly handles non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple) when extracting values from the received data and validating them.

The fix should involve checking for the type of field and handling non-typing sequences differently from other types. Additionally, the function should validate non-typing sequences correctly to avoid the errors seen in the failing tests.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)

        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue

        # Correctly handle non-typing sequences (list, set, tuple)
        if field.shape in (3, 4, 5):  # sequence shapes for list, set, tuple
            value = cast(Sequence, value)  # type cast to Sequence
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))

        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, I removed the unnecessary check for len(required_params) and the embed attribute. Then, I added additional logic to correctly handle non-typing sequences by validating and casting their values if necessary.

With these corrections, the function should now handle non-typing sequences like list, set, and tuple properly, and the failing test cases should pass.
