## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert the received_body, which can be either a dictionary or FormData, to a dictionary of values and a list of errors, based on the required_params provided. The function seems to be designed to handle sequences of values for a single key, such as a list, set, or tuple. However, it has a bug that prevents it from correctly handling multiple values for a single key in FormData, as described in the GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data". The current implementation only captures the last value for a key in the FormData, which does not align with the expectations of the users.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in FormData and convert them to a list of values for the same key, rather than only capturing the last value. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles sequences of values for a single key.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    
                if isinstance(value, list) and len(value) == 1 and not isinstance(field.type_, list):
                    value = value[0]

            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```
In the corrected version, we have removed unnecessary variable assignments, modified the handling of values from FormData to capture all values for the same key into a list, and updated the logic to correctly handle sequences of values for a single key. Additionally, we have addressed the issue of incorrect validation errors being appended to the errors list.
