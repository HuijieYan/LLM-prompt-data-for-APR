The bug in the provided code stems from the implementation of the `request_body_to_args` function, which is failing to correctly process the received_body parameter. This is leading to incorrect assertion failures in the test cases. The function is intended to extract values from the received body and validate them against a list of required parameters.

The potential error locations in the code include the handling of FormData, sequence_shapes, and the validation of field values.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of parameters and data types within the function, leading to incorrect validation or transformation of the received data. This is evident from the failing test cases, the corresponding error messages, and the runtime input/output variable values, where the expected values do not match the actual output values.

To fix the bug, the implementation of `request_body_to_args` should be revised to correctly handle the received_body data, taking into account different parameter types and structure.

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None and field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version focuses on properly extracting the value from the received body, validating it against the required parameters, and populating the values and errors lists accordingly. This should resolve the issues with the failing test cases.
