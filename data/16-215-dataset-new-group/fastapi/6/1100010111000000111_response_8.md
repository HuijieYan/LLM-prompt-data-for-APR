The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has several potential error locations. One potential cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle non-typing sequences such as Python lists, sets, and tuples when received as form data. This issue is evident in the failing tests `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`, which expect the function to correctly parse and validate non-typing sequences received as form data, but it fails to do so.

The GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data" further explains that the current behavior only captures the last key=value pair in form data, rather than collecting all repeated keys into a list for validation, as expected by the user.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `request_body_to_args` function to properly handle non-typing sequences when received as form data by checking for their presence and correctly parsing them as lists, sets, or tuples.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.shape == "list":
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    elif field.shape == "set":
                        value = set(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    elif field.shape == "tuple":
                        value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    else:  # default to list if shape is not specified
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the parsing of non-typing sequences (list, set, and tuple) when they are received as form data. We use the `getlist` method to retrieve multiple values associated with a single key and convert them to the appropriate sequence type before validation.

With this fix, the `request_body_to_args` function should now handle non-typing sequences received as form data correctly and pass the failing tests. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issue by supporting repeated key=value pairs in form data as expected by the user.
