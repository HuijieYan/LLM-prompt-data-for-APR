The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing it to not handle the input correctly, leading to a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. The function is not properly handling non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle non-typing sequences like lists, sets, and tuples when they are passed as form data. This causes the validation to fail and returns a status code of 422 instead of 200.

To fix the bug, you should update the code to properly handle non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples when they are passed as form data.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        if received_body is not None:
            value: Any = None
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            elif field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle non-typing sequences when passed as form data, and the failing tests should now pass successfully.
