## Correction to the cause of the buggy function

The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is intended to process a list of required parameters and a received body to extract values and errors. However, there are several issues with the current implementation that prevent it from working as expected. The function does not handle the scenario where there are repeated keys with different values in the FormData. This is related to the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data".

The function fails to properly handle the parsing of FormData when there are repeated keys, and it also fails to properly handle values that should be converted to lists or other sequence types.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle repeated keys in the FormData. Additionally, it should handle values that need to be converted to lists or other sequence types based on the field definitions.

The modifications should include a check for repeated keys in the FormData and an update to the value extraction process to properly parse the inputs and handle sequence types.

    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],

    values = {}
    errors = []
    sequence_shapes = {1}  # Assuming 1 as the shape of sequence types
    sequence_types = {tuple, set, list}  # Assuming these are the sequence types that need special handling
    sequence_shape_to_type = {
        1: list  # Assuming 1 represents lists
    }

    if received_body:
        received_data = dict(received_body) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_data:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_data[field.alias], list):
                    # If the field represents a sequence (e.g. list), retrieve the values as a list

            elif (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)

    return values, errors
```

This corrected function incorporates the necessary modifications to properly handle repeated keys in FormData and extract values based on the field definitions. It also includes the necessary checks to process the values as lists or other sequence types as needed.
