The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for converting the received request body into arguments. The related test file `test_forms_from_non_typing_sequences` contains test cases for posting form data with a list, set, and tuple. The GitHub issue "Support repeated key=value in form data" explains that currently FastAPI doesn't support repeated keys in form data and suggests that the framework should collect repeated keys and assign them to a list to handle validation.

The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data, which is causing the failing tests as they're trying to post form data with a list, set, and tuple.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not handling repeated keys correctly, and it doesn't support validation of repeated keys in form data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in form data and assign them to a list to handle validation. The function should also be updated to support validation of repeated keys in form data.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                raw_value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                if len(raw_value) == 1:
                    value = raw_value[0]
                else:
                    value = raw_value
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.alias] = field.default
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.alias] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we added logic to check if the field's shape is a sequence and the received body is a FormData. If so, we retrieve the values as a list and handle repeated keys correctly. We also updated the validation logic for the fields.

This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report.
