The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function is causing the failing tests to not return the expected status code and values. The issue appears to be in the type validation of the `received_body` parameter and in the construction of the return value `values` for different model field types (list, set, tuple).

When parsing the `received_body` with list, set, or tuple types, the input data needs to be handled correctly and validated according to the specified field type. Additionally, the error wrapper objects are constructed incorrectly, leading to failing tests.

A strategy to fix the bug is to handle the `received_body` correctly based on the type of the model field and ensure that the validation and error wrapper construction is aligned with the data received.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, various improvements have been made:

1. Removed unnecessary checks and operations that don't align with the behavior of models from Pydantic.
2. Updated the handling of the `received_body` based on the model field type.
3. Removed the unnecessary embed check and simplify the validation process for the fields.
4. Adjusted the validation and construction of error wrappers to match the behavior of the field validation.
5. Removed the base config usage and simplified the process for constructing error wrappers.

Once the corrected version is implemented, the failing tests should pass, and the expected status code and values should be returned successfully.
