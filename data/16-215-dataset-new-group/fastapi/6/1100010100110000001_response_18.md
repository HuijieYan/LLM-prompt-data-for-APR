The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is being used in FastAPI to convert request body values into arguments that will be used to call a path operation function.

Based on the error messages from the failing tests, it seems that the buggy function is returning a status code of 422 instead of the expected 200. This implies that the request body is undergoing validation, and the buggy function might be incorrectly processing the request body parameters.

The cause of the bug is due to the way the function handles incoming data for sequences (e.g., lists, sets, tuples) when passed in a form. The function does not correctly parse and serialize data received from the request body, leading to incorrect validation errors and response status codes.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be updated to correctly handle the incoming request body parameters while considering the shape of the fields and the type of data being received for sequences.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        field_info = get_field_info(field)

        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
            if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                # When shape is a sequence and FormData is received
                if field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body[field.alias]

                if value is not None:
                    values[field.name] = value
                elif field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
        else:
            if received_body is not None and field.alias in received_body:
                value = received_body[field.alias]
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
        if value is not None:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the incoming request body for sequences and processes the field validations accordingly, ensuring that the correct response status codes are returned. Now, the corrected function should pass the failing tests.
