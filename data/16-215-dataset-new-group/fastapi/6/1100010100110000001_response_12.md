The demonstrated error message suggests that the `response.status_code` is not equal to the expected value of `200`. It seems that the function `request_body_to_args` is unable to process the input data correctly, leading to a 422 error code instead of the expected 200.

The potential error locations in the buggy function can be in the section where it processes different shapes of fields (lists, sets, tuples), as indicated by the failing tests.

The cause of the bug can be related to the handling of sequence shapes in the code, which is failing to correctly validate and map the input data to the expected field shapes.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function should be updated to handle sequence shapes (e.g., lists, sets, tuples) appropriately, ensuring that the data is parsed and validated correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

Note: The corrected function addresses the handling of sequence shapes by appropriately validating the input data and capturing the errors. However, it's advisable to test the corrected function with the failing tests to ensure that it resolves the issue.
