To fix the bug in the `request_body_to_args` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles different types of sequences (list, set, tuple) when received as form data. Based on the failing tests and error messages, it seems that the function is not properly handling the input data and is returning a status code of 422 instead of 200.

The bug appears to be related to the incorrect parsing and validation of the received form data, which leads to the function returning error responses instead of the expected values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle different types of sequences when received as form data. This includes parsing the form data, validating the values, and returning the expected output. We also need to ensure that the correct status code is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.alias] = value
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, we are checking for the presence of the received form data and handling different types of sequences accordingly. We then validate the values and return the expected output. This should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing tests and returns the correct status code and responses.
