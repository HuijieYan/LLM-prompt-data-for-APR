The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The check for `sequence_shapes` is not defined in the provided code.
2. The use of `sequence_types` and `sequence_shape_to_type` is ambiguous and not defined.
3. The usage of form parameters `params.Form` may lead to issues due to incorrect imports or compatibility issues.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function is the presence of undefined variables such as `sequence_shapes`, `sequence_types`, and `sequence_shape_to_type`. Additionally, incorrect usage of `params.Form` may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the following actions can be taken:
1. Define `sequence_shapes`, `sequence_types`, and `sequence_shape_to_type` appropriately to ensure their correct usage.
2. Ensure that the imports for `params.Form` and related modules are correct and compatible.

Here's the corrected version of the function considering the above suggestions:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in ["List", "Set"]:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    error_location = ("body", field.alias)
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=error_location))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the potential issues mentioned and should function as expected. However, it's important to define `sequence_shapes`, `sequence_types`, and `sequence_shape_to_type` as per the project's requirements and ensure correct import of `params.Form` and related modules.
