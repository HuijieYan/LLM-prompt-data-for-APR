Looking at the buggy function and the failing tests, we can see that the function is failing to handle lists, sets, and tuples as form data. This is leading to a 422 response status code instead of the expected 200.

It seems that the function is not correctly transforming the data from FormData into the expected list, set, or tuple.

To fix this, we need to make sure that the received body is parsed correctly and transformed into the appropriate data structure before validation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    # Convert form data to the appropriate sequence type
                    if field.type_ == list:
                        value = list(value)
                    elif field.type_ == set:
                        value = set(value)
                    elif field.type_ == tuple:
                        value = tuple(value)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # ... rest of the validation logic remains unchanged
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition inside the function to correctly convert the form data into lists, sets, or tuples, based on the type set for the field.

With this change, the function should now correctly handle lists, sets, and tuples passed as form data, and the failing tests should pass with a 200 response status code instead of 422.
