The function `request_body_to_args` has several potential error locations, including:
1. The use of `lenient_issubclass` without proper checking
2. The logic around checking for missing values and assigning defaults
3. The handling of different parameter shapes and types

The failing test functions `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` are asserting the incorrect status code (422 instead of 200) and incorrect response values. The error messages indicate that the status code is incorrect.

The GitHub issue mentions that repeated key=value pairs in form data are not handled correctly, and it proposes a solution to collect repeated keys in a 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data and ensure that the correct status code and response values are returned.

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData  # Check if received body is of type FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Get all the values for the specific key
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or value == "":  # Check for missing or empty values
                if field.required:  # If field is required
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)  # Assign default value
            else:
                values[field.name] = value

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we are directly assigning the values from the form data to the `values` dictionary, and we are handling the repeated key=value pairs using the `getlist` method for FormData. This will ensure that repeated keys are collected as lists and assigned to the same key before the validation happens.

By making these changes, we can address the bug and ensure that the failing test cases pass. This will also address the GitHub issue by correctly handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.
