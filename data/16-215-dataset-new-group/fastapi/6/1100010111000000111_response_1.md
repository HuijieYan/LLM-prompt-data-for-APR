In the buggy function `request_body_to_args`, there are several potential error locations that could be causing the issue:
1. The logic for handling repeated keys in form data may not be implemented correctly.
2. The value extraction from `FormData` may not be handling repeated keys properly.
3. There might be an issue with the validation of the extracted values.

The failing tests indicate that there is a problem with handling sequences in `FormData` for `python-list`, `python-set`, and `python-tuple` parameters.

Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem originates from how FastAPI handles repeated keys in form data and how it validates them against a parameter marked as a list, set, or tuple.

To fix the bug, we can re-implement the logic for handling repeated keys in form data, ensuring that all values are collected as lists before validation happens.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        form_data = received_body.multi_items()
        values = {
            field.alias: [item[1] for item in form_data if item[0] == field.alias]
            for field in required_params
        }
        for field in required_params:
            if field.alias not in values:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                value = values[field.alias]
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected version should handle repeated keys in form data correctly and validate them against the required parameters marked as lists, sets, or tuples, thereby passing the failing tests and resolving the GitHub issue.
