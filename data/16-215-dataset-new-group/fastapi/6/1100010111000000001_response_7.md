The provided function `request_body_to_args` is intended to convert the received body (FormData) into arguments based on the required params (ModelField). However, there seem to be issues with how the function handles sequence shapes and error handling, leading to failures when testing with composite data structures like lists, sets, and tuples.

Upon analysis, it seems that the issue lies within the handling of sequence shapes such as lists, sets, and tuples. Additionally, there might be issues with how errors are being appended and handled within the function.

One strategy to fix the bug is to revise the logic for handling sequence shapes, ensuring that values from FormData are correctly extracted and validated. Additionally, the error handling should be reviewed to ensure that errors are properly reported for missing or invalid data.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple
from pydantic import ModelField
from fastapi import UploadFile

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    for field in required_params:
        value = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(
                    ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                )
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version of the function, the issue with handling sequence shapes and validation has been addressed. Now, the function should be able to handle composite data structures like lists, sets, and tuples correctly. Additionally, the error handling logic has been streamlined to ensure that errors are appended and reported correctly.

After applying this fixed version of the `request_body_to_args` function, it should pass the previously failing test cases for lists, sets, and tuples.
