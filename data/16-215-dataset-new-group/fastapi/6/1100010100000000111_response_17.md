### Analysis:
The buggy function `request_body_to_args` is responsible for processing the request body and converting it into args for validation. The problem described in the GitHub issue is related to handling repeated key-value pairs in form data.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The code may not be correctly handling repeated key-value pairs in the `FormData`.
2. The validation logic may not be processing repeated key-value pairs as expected.
3. The code may not be correctly validating the input when dealing with repeated keys.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causing the issue described in GitHub is that the provided function does not correctly handle repeated key-value pairs in the form data, resulting in only the last key-value pair being processed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle repeated key-value pairs and store them as lists in the args for validation. This would involve checking for repeated keys and appropriately storing their values as lists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if received_body is not None and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []

            for key, value in received_body.items():
                if key == field.alias:
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(value, list):
                        values[field.name].extend(value)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = value

            if field.required:
                # Validation logic for required fields
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                # If not required, store the default value
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, we loop through the received form data to check for repeated keys and handle them accordingly by storing their values as lists. This ensures that all the values for the same key are collected together for validation. The validation logic is also adapted to handle repeated key-value pairs correctly.
