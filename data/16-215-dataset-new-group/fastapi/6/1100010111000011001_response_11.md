The buggy function `request_body_to_args` has several issues in handling form data, specifically for non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples. The function is unable to parse these types of data correctly, resulting in validation errors when trying to access the received body.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for extracting and validating the form data for non-typing sequences. Specifically, we need to handle the cases where the form data represents non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, and tuples, and ensure that the data is correctly extracted and validated.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Extract list data
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)  # Extract single value
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

Please note that there are some missing context in the provided code (e.g., `sequence_shapes`, `sequence_types`, `sequence_shape_to_type`) that are not fully defined in the provided code snippet, so their exact implementation might need to be adapted based on the actual requirements and usage within the codebase.

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the form data for non-typing sequences and pass the failing test cases.
