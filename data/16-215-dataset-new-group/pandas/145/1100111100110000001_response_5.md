The issue here is that the code is using the '*' operator between a `DataFrame` and a `timedelta` scalar in pandas, resulting in a TypeError when trying to evaluate the operation due to the incompatible operand types.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to identify the operation where the issue is occurring and handle such DataFrame and scalar operations correctly. 

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    df = left  # Assign the left DataFrame to a new variable df
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = df.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(df)
        new_data = df.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

This version ensures that when `right` is a scalar, the `func` is applied to every column of the DataFrame using the `apply` function, which will handle the operation correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
