The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be causing issues with handling `timedelta64` data types, as indicated by the failing test where the result of the operation is not as expected.

The buggy function fails to correctly handle the case when the right parameter is a Series of `timedelta64` data type with a `NaT` value, leading to unexpected behavior in the function's return.

The issue seems to stem from the implementation of the `column_op` functions within the `dispatch_to_series` function. These column_op functions are used to apply the arithmetic operation `func` to the DataFrame `left` and the right parameter, depending on their types and properties.

To fix the bug, we need to edit the `column_op` functions to correctly handle the case when the right parameter is a Series of `timedelta64` data type with a `NaT` value.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should now pass, as the correct handling of `timedelta64` data type with a `NaT` value has been addressed.
