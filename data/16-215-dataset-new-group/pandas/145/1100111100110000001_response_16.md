### Analysis
The error message indicates that the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the operation between a DataFrame and a Series correctly. It is trying to perform the arithmetic operation, but it's unable to operate on an array of integers and a NaT (not a time) value. This is leading to a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

### Bug Location
The bug is occurring in the `dispatch_to_series` function at the line:
```python
return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
```
where the operation is performed on the DataFrame and the Series.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is attempting to perform a column-by-column operation using `func` which results in the error when `func` is a multiplication and it tries to apply it to a DataFrame column and a NaT value. 

### Proposed Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug needs to be fixed by handling the situation where the right operand is a scalar or a Series of different types and taking different actions accordingly.

### The Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Case where right is a scalar
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # Case where right is a DataFrame
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        # Case where right is a Series and operate row-by-row
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        # Case where right is a Series and operate column-by-column
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the bug is resolved as the function now handles the cases where the right operand can be a scalar, a DataFrame or a Series, and applies the operation accordingly.
