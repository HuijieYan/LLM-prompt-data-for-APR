The bug is in the `dispatch_to_series` function in `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py`. The error message indicates that it is trying to perform a multiplication operation with an array and `NaT` type which is not supported. The error comes from the function `masked_arith_op` in `pandas/core/ops/array_ops.py`. The `masked_arith_op` function is expecting types that it cannot handle, causing the TypeError to be raised.

The cause of the bug is that the code in the `dispatch_to_series` function does not have appropriate checks or handling for when the right operand is `NaT`. This issue causes errors to arise when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `NaT` type.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `NaT` type in the `dispatch_to_series` function and handle it appropriately to avoid invoking arithmetic operations between incompatible types.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    if right is pd.NaT:
        raise ValueError("Right operand is NaT, cannot perform arithmetic operation")
    else:
        import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
            # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
            # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
        return new_data
```

With the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function, it now checks for the `NaT` type in the `right` operand, and raises a ValueError if `NaT` is detected. This would prevent the code from trying to perform arithmetic operations with the `NaT` type, avoiding the TypeError.
