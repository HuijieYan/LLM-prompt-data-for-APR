The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to inappropriate logic when handling certain conditions. It appears that when passing a Series as the `right` parameter and the `axis` is set to "columns", the function should have a specific implementation to operate row by row, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

To fix this bug, a new logic should be added to properly handle the scenario where a Series is passed as the `right` parameter, and the `axis` is set to "columns".

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    if axis == "columns" and isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        new_data = {}
        for i in range(len(left.columns)):
            new_data[left.columns[i]] = func(left.iloc[:, i], right)
    else:
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
            new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)
            new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, left, right)

```

In this corrected version, the condition to handle the scenario where a Series is passed as the `right` parameter and the `axis` is set to "columns" has been properly implemented. This should address the bug and return the expected output for the failing test cases.
