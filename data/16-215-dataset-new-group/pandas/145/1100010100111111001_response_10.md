The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. This error occurs because the operation is not being properly dispatched to the series implementation for handling.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        if right.index.equals(left.columns):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=0)
            return new_data

    # For other cases, proceed with the original implementation
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # ... (rest of the original implementation)

        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values by using the `apply` method to perform the operation column-by-column. This ensures that the operation is properly dispatched to the series implementation, resolving the TypeError.

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
