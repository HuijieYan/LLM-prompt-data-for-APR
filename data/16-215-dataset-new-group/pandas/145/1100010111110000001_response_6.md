The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of timedelta objects, specifically `Timedelta("NaT")`, when performing certain operations with the DataFrame. The failing test indicates that the function is treating the timedelta as datetime64, leading to a TypeError.

The cause of the bug seems to be the mishandling of the timedelta type within the `dispatch_to_series` function when it encounters a series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The error message suggests that the function is using an unsupported operation between numpy.ndarray and 'NaTType', which arises from the mishandling of timedelta objects.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the timedelta objects correctly within the `dispatch_to_series` function, especially when the right operand is a series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. We should make sure that proper checks and casting are implemented for timedelta objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    # If the right operand is timedelta, convert it to compatible types before evaluation
    if isinstance(right, ABCDatetimeIndex) or isinstance(right, ABCTimedeltaIndex) or isinstance(right, np.timedelta64):
        right = pd.to_timedelta(right, unit='ns')

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle timedelta objects and cast them to a compatible format for evaluation. This should address the bug and make the function compatible with the failing test case.
