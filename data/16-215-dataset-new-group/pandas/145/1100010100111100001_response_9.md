The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not handling the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values correctly, leading to a TypeError when a binary operation is attempted between 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the function to handle the specific case of operating on a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values more effectively.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        # If right is a Series of type timedelta64, we need to handle the operation differently
        if axis == "columns":
            # If the axis is "columns", operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
        else:
            # Otherwise, assume right.index matches left.index and operate column-by-column
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=1)
    else:
        # For other cases, simply apply the operation as before
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)

    return new_data
```
This corrected version of the function first checks if the right input is a Series of type 'timedelta64[ns]'. If it is, the function applies the operation between the DataFrame and the Series, either row-by-row or column-by-column, depending on the axis.

With this fix, the function should correctly handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series that contains NaT values, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
