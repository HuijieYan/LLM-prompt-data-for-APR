The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely caused by the handling of timedelta values in the `column_op` functions, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to perform the arithmetic operation.

The current implementation of the `column_op` function does not handle the case for NaT values correctly, leading to the `TypeError` when attempting the arithmetic operation.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the right operand is NaT. This can be achieved by checking for NaT values and skipping the operation in such cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import Timedelta, Timestamp, lib, ops as libops
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCDatetimeArray, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCExtensionArray, ABCIndexClass, ABCSeries, ABCTimedeltaArray, ABCTimedeltaIndex
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b is pd.NaT:
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `column_op` function now checks for the NaT value and avoids trying to perform the arithmetic operation in that case, resolving the `TypeError` issue.

Please note that additional testing and validation may be required to ensure the corrected function works as expected.
