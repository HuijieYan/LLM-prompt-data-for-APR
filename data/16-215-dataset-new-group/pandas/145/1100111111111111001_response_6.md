To fix the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function, we need to ensure that the column-wise operation is correctly applied based on the type of the `right` input. 

The issue arises when working with a scalar value or Series of timedelta (including NaT) data type. Therefore, we need to handle these cases separately within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    # Handle the case when the right input is a scalar
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    # Handle the case when the right input is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns)}

    # Handle the case when the right input is a Series and the axis is set to "columns"
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    # Handle the case when the right input is a Series
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, left, right)
```

The corrected function now handles each case based on the type and properties of the `right` input. This should resolve the issue of the failing test and ensure that the function correctly applies the column-wise operation to the DataFrame based on the type of the `right` input.
