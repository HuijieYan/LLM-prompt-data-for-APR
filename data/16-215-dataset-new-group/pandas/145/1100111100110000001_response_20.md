## Analysis
The error message indicates that there is a bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function. It is failing because it is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a NumPy array and a NaTType (Not a Time) value, which is not supported.

## Bug location
The bug is most likely located within the `column_op` function defined inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. This function is responsible for performing the actual operator computation in a column-wise manner. The error is occurring when trying to perform the operation in cases where the right operand is a scalar or a non-matching DataFrame or Series.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the inability of the `column_op` function to handle cases where the right operand is a NaTType or the operands do not match, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting the operation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `column_op` function to properly handle cases where the right operand is a scalar or a non-matching DataFrame or Series. This can be achieved by adding appropriate condition checks and handling the operations accordingly.

## Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `column_op` function and the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # .. existing code ..

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iat[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

def column_op(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # .. existing code ..
```
By making these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case should now pass.
