The main issue here is that our function `dispatch_to_series` doesn't handle the case of performing a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with missing values (NaT). The error message is showing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, which indicates that the function does not handle this specific case.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right operand is a `NaTType`. We can define a new case in `column_op` that specifically deals with the multiplication operation involving a `numpy.ndarray` and a `NaTType`.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert len(right) == len(left)  # Adding this assertion to handle Series of same length

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(b.dtype):
                # Handling the case of multiplication involving a DataFrame and a Series with missing values (NaT)
                result = {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
                return result
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
    # (omitting it for brevity)
```

The modified `column_op` function now includes specific handling for the case where `b` is a Series of type `timedelta64` and contains `NaT` values. The `if` condition checks if the right operand `b` is a Series of type `timedelta64`, and if so, applies the multiplication operation with special handling for `NaT` values.

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the specific case that led to the `TypeError` in the error message, and it should pass the failing test.
