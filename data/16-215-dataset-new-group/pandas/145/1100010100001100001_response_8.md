The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be related to the handling of the `right` input parameter, which can be either a scalar, DataFrame, or Series. The function is designed to dispatch the operation to the Series implementation and evaluate column-by-column.

The bug appears to be in the conditional branching logic for different types of the `right` parameter. In the given runtime values, the input `right` is a Series with index matching the column index of the `left` DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is that when `right` is a Series with matching indices, the function fails to handle the case properly and incorrectly tries to handle it as a non-matching index case.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the conditional branching logic to handle the case when `right` is a Series with matching indices correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis == "columns" or right.index.equals(left.columns)):
        # Handle the case when right is a Series with matching indices
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, a new condition is added to handle the case when `right` is a Series with matching indices. This condition ensures that the function correctly handles the specified case and returns the expected output.
