The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of `NaN` values when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64` data type.

The failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` passes a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` with `timedelta64[ns]` data type to the `*` operator. The expected behavior is that the result should be a DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding value in the Series.

The bug seems to occur during the handling of the `NaN` values in the Series when performing the arithmetic operation. It may be related to the way the `NaN` values are handled or casted during the operation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle `NaN` values when performing arithmetic operations with Series of `timedelta64[ns]` data type.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should properly handle the arithmetic operations between DataFrames and Series with `timedelta64[ns]` data type, including the handling of `NaN` values.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
