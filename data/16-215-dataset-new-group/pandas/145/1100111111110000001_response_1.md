The error message indicates that the TypeError "unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" is raised. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` calls `df * ser`, expecting the result to be a DataFrame of the same shape as `df`, where the values in `df` are multiplied element-wise by the corresponding value in `ser`. However, the test is currently failing because of the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function.


### Bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function:
The bug occurs when the argument `right` is of type `ABCDataFrame` or `ABCSeries` with `axis=None`. The dispatch_to_series function has specific cases handled based on the type of `right`. However, if `right` is of type `ABCDataFrame` or `ABCSeries` with `axis=None`, the expected code to handle the operation is missing, leading to the `NotImplementedError` for the given `right`.


Given this, the bug can be fixed as follows:
- Add an additional case to handle `ABCSeries` with `axis` as None.
- Implement the operation for that specific case.


Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # ...

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis is None:
        # Handle element-wise operation for right with axis None
        if len(right) == len(left):
            result = left.copy()
            for i in range(len(left.columns)):
                result.iloc[:, i] = func(left.iloc[:, i], right)
            new_data = result
        else:
            raise ValueError("Length mismatch: Expected axis has %d elements, new values have %d elements" % (len(left), len(right)))
    # ...

    return new_data
```

With the fix above, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the given test case correctly and the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass without any errors.
