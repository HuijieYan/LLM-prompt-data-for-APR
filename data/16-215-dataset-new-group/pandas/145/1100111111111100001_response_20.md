The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of timedelta and NaN values. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication between a numpy array and a NaTType.

The bug occurs when the function tries to perform the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`, which contains NaT values. The code is not handling the NaT values properly, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the cases where the right operand contains NaT values.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, np.datetime64):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            elif pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function has been modified to handle the case where the right operand `b` is a NaT value. If `b` is a NaT value, it will simply return a dictionary with the same NaT value for each column index.

This modification should fix the bug and make the failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` pass.
