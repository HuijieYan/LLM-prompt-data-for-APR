## The bug
The `dispatch_to_series` function fails to correctly handle the case when a scalar `right` is a Series with 'timedelta64' data type. It should dispatch each column of the DataFrame `left` to the Series `right` using the arithmetic operation indicated by `func`. However, in the case of a Series with 'timedelta64' data type, the function does not handle the columns correctly, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We should modify the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case when a scalar `right` is a Series with 'timedelta64' data type and perform the arithmetic operations on each column of the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right` individually.

## The corrected version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[col.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    return new_data
```

By using the `apply` method on the DataFrame `left`, we can apply the function `func` to each column of the DataFrame individually, ensuring that the arithmetic operations are performed correctly and the results are as expected.
