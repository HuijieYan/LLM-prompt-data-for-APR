The issue with the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the way it handles the different data types and operations. The function is designed to evaluate frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. It includes different conditions for handling scalars, DataFrames, and Series, but there are potential errors in the implementation of these conditions.

The potential error locations within the function are in the conditions where it checks the type of the `right` parameter and decides on the operation to perform based on its type.

The cause of the bug could be that the function doesn't handle all possible combinations of `left` and `right` input types correctly. For example, it may not handle cases where `right` is a scalar or a Series with a different index than the `left` DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the conditions for handling the different types of `right` input and ensure that the function can handle all possible scenarios correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
        The left DataFrame for the operation
    right : scalar or DataFrame
        The right scalar or DataFrame for the operation
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
        The function to apply to the operation
    str_rep : str or None, default None
        String representation
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}
        Axis to perform the operation on

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        The result of the operation
    """

    # Determine the type of `right` input and handle the operation accordingly
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Case: right is a scalar or 0-dimensional
        data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        # Case: right is a DataFrame
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[col.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        # Case: right is a Series
        if axis == "columns":
            # Operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[left.index]))

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported type for right input")

    return data
```

In the corrected version, the function directly checks the type of `right` and appropriately applies the operation based on the type. It accounts for scenarios where `right` is a scalar, a DataFrame, or a Series with the correct index matching the `left` DataFrame. The usage of lambda functions with `apply` ensures that the operation is correctly performed column-by-column or row-by-row based on the input types.

This should resolve the potential errors and provide a more robust implementation for the `dispatch_to_series` function.
