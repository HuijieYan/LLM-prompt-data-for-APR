The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function in the file `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by unsupported operand types for multiplication ('numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'). This error occurs when trying to perform the operation `op(a, b)` in the `_evaluate_standard` function within `pandas/core/computation/expressions.py`.

The failed test involves a DataFrame multiplication with a Series containing NaT (Not a Time) values. The expected behavior is to handle this case and return the result of the operation without raising a `TypeError`.

The bug is due to the fact that the function does not handle the case where the right operand of the operation is a Series containing NaT values. As a result, the function generates a `TypeError` when trying to perform the operation on the NaT values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle this specific case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.isna().any():
        # Handle the case where 'right' is a Series containing NaT values
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.apply(lambda x: x if not pd.isna(x) else 1)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a new condition to handle the case where 'right' is a Series containing NaT values. We use the `apply` method to replace the NaT values with 1, and then perform the operation on the DataFrame and the modified Series.

This corrected version should handle the case of multiplying a DataFrame with a Series containing NaT values without raising a `TypeError`.
