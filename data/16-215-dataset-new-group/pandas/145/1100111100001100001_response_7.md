The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be related to the handling of the `right` input parameter when it is a Series. Based on the given runtime values and types, it looks like the function is not properly handling the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`.

The function is trying to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame `left` and perform the specified operation with the corresponding values from the Series `right`. However, it seems that the iteration and operation are not being performed correctly based on the observed output.

To fix this bug, the implementation of the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'` should be reviewed and modified to correctly perform the operation with the corresponding values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {col: func(left[col], b) for col in left.columns}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'` has been updated to correctly perform the operation with the corresponding values. Specifically, the iteration over columns and the operation with the Series `right` within the `column_op` function has been modified to directly perform the operation using the column values.

This updated implementation should handle the specified case correctly and resolve the bug.
