The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of timedeltas in the DataFrame operations. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle operations involving timedeltas and may lead to unexpected results or errors.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to handle timedelta calculations correctly, ensuring that the computation is performed as expected and the result is consistent with the operations on DataFrames and Series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    # Handle timedelta operations
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype.type == np.timedelta64:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
        return new_data
    
    # Handle other cases
    # ... (code for other cases)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the `right` parameter is a Series of dtype `timedelta64`. If it is, we apply the `func` operation to each column of the `left` DataFrame and the `right` Series using DataFrame's `apply` method, which will handle the timedelta operations correctly. This should address the bug and ensure the correct behavior for timedelta operations.

By making this change, the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle timedelta operations correctly and pass the failing test.
