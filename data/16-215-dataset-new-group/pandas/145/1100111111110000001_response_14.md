The bug is caused by the `dispatch_to_series` function in the pandas library. The function is meant to evaluate the frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. However, there is an issue when the function tries to perform arithmetic operations on a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. This results in a `TypeError` stating that the operation is not supported for 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The main cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values correctly. The bug is specifically exposed in the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` from the `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` file. 

To fix the bug, the `dispatch_to_series` function should be modified to handle the arithmetic operation involving NaT values correctly.

The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.generic import NDFrame

# this is the corrected function
def dispatch_to_series(left: NDFrame, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None) -> NDFrame:
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]" and axis == "columns":
        results = {}
        for col in left.columns:
            results[col] = func(left[col], right)
        return pd.DataFrame(results)
    return func(left, right)
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function explicitly checks if the `right` operand is a Series containing timedelta values and the operation has to be performed along the columns. If this condition is met, the necessary operation is carried out, and the result is returned as a DataFrame. Otherwise, it falls back to the original operation handling.

This correction should resolve the bug and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
