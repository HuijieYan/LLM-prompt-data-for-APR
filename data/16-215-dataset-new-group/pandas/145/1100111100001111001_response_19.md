The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing the output to be incorrect. The bug appears to be related to the `column_op` function that is defined within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This function is used to perform element-wise operations on the columns of the DataFrame and the right input.

The bug is likely causing the function to return incorrect values, as the current implementation of `column_op` does not seem to handle the input values correctly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle the different types of inputs and perform the operation as expected based on the input types and values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = left.apply(column_op, b=right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is modified to accept two inputs and perform the operation based on the input types and values. The `apply` method is then used to apply the `column_op` function to the columns of the DataFrame, ensuring that the operation is performed correctly.
