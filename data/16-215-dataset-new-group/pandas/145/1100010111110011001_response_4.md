The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to handle operations between a DataFrame and a scalar or another DataFrame. However, it fails to correctly handle the case where the right operand is a Series with dtype "timedelta64[ns]". This is evident from the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, where the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by a Series `ser` with dtype "timedelta64[ns]".

The error message indicates that the problem occurs during the evaluation of the expression `df * ser`. The error specifically states that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication of 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

It seems that the `dispatch_to_series` function fails to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with dtype "timedelta64[ns]". This causes the error during the evaluation of the arithmetic operation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with dtype "timedelta64[ns]". We should add a new conditional block to handle this case specifically.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.series as series
    import pandas.core.frame as frame
    from pandas.core.arrays import TimedeltaArray

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, frame.DataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, series.Series):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        if isinstance(right.array, TimedeltaArray):
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported series dtype")

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected function, we added a conditional block for handling the case where `right` is a Series. We further check if the dtype of the Series is "timedelta64[ns]" and handle the operation accordingly. If the dtype is not "timedelta64[ns]", we raise a `NotImplementedError` indicating that the series dtype is not supported.

The corrected function should now handle the multiplication of the DataFrame with the timedelta Series without throwing any errors.
