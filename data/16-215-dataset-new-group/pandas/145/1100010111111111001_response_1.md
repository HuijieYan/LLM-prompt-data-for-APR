The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of type timedelta64[ns]. The error message indicates that the operation is not supported for 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of the right operand (Series) containing NaT values of type timedelta64[ns]. The current implementation of the function is not properly handling this specific case, leading to the TypeError during evaluation.

To fix this bug, the function `dispatch_to_series` needs to be modified to handle the case of operating on a DataFrame with a Series containing NaT values of type timedelta64[ns]. This may involve checking for NaT values and implementing specific handling for these cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compatibility with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            mask = b.isna()
            b[mask] = pd.Timedelta(0)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have added a specific handling for the case where the right operand is a Series of type timedelta64[ns]. We check for NaT values in the Series and replace them with a default value (e.g., `pd.Timedelta(0)`) before performing the operation.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `dispatch_to_series` function can handle DataFrame-Serie arithmetic operations involving timedelta values correctly.
