The issue with the function lies in the part of the code that handles various types of input for the 'right' parameter. There are multiple conditions to check the type of 'right', and the implementation to handle each type is different. However, for some types, the handling is not complete, leading to a NotImplementedError being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that for all possible types of 'right', the function is able to handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # For scalars, apply the function to each column
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=0)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # For DataFrames, apply the function to corresponding columns
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[idx]), args=(right.columns,), axis=0)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # For Series and axis="columns", apply the function to each row
        new_data = left.apply(lambda row: func(row, right), axis=1)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        # For Series, apply the function to each column
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=0)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have used the `apply` function to apply the `func` to each column or row based on the type of 'right' and the specified axis. This ensures that the function is able to handle different types of input for 'right' and return the expected output for each case.
