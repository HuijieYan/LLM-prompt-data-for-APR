The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function of the file `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py`. The issue is raised when the function tries to evaluate the expression `op(a, b)`, where `a` is a NumPy array and `b` is a NaT (Not a Time) type. The error message `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` indicates that the operation between a NumPy array and a NaT type is not supported.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where `b` is a NaT type. We should check the type of `b` before performing the operation and handle the NaT type separately.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif lib.is_scalar(b) and pd.isna(b):
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we added a new condition to check if `b` is a scalar and represents NaN or NaT using `pd.isna(b)`. If it does, we define the `column_op` function to handle this case and perform the operation between the DataFrame `a` and the NaN/NaT value `b`. This modification ensures that the operation between a NumPy array and a NaT type is properly handled.

With this corrected function, the failing test should now pass without raising a TypeError related to unsupported operand types between a NumPy array and a NaT type.
