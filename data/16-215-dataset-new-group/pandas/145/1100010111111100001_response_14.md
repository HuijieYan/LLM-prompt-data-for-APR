The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing an error when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta objects. The error is occurring because the function is not handling the calculation properly for timedelta objects in the Series.

The bug is likely in the `column_op` function, where the individual column-wise calculations are being performed. It seems that the function is not handling the timedelta objects correctly, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the timedelta objects in a Series correctly when performing the column-wise operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b.dt, Timedelta):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function now checks if the Series `b` contains timedelta objects, and if so, performs the operation with each element of the DataFrame's column. This change ensures that the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series of timedelta objects is handled properly.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass without raising the TypeError.
