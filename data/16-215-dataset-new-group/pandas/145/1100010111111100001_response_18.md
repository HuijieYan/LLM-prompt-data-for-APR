The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is failing to properly handle the operation when multiplying a DataFrame `left` with a Series `right` of dtype `timedelta64[ns]` containing NaT values. The expected behavior is to return a new DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding value in the Series, with NaT values carried through as NaT.

The implementation of the function is attempting to perform the operation using `expressions.evaluate`, and the failure occurs when trying to evaluate the operation due to unsupported operand types for multiplication.

The bug seems to stem from the handling of NaT values in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. It seems that the implementation is not handling NaT values appropriately leading to the failure.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should be updated to handle NaT values properly when performing the operations on the DataFrame columns and Series elements. Specifically, the handling of NA values along with NaT values needs to be taken into consideration to ensure the operations are carried out correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function now correctly handles the NaT values within the Series when performing the operations on the DataFrame columns.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
