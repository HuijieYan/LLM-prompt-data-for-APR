The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. The function takes in parameters `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (a scalar or DataFrame), `func` (an arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (a string or None), and `axis` (None, 0, 1, "index", "columns").

The function then checks the type of `right` and, based on its type and other conditions, determines the appropriate `column_op` function to use for evaluating the operation. The result is obtained by calling `expressions.evaluate` with the determined `column_op`.

The failing test is testing the behavior of the function when performing arithmetic operations with a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The test specifically checks that the function does not accidentally treat `timedelta64(NaT)` as `datetime64`.

Upon analysis, it seems that the function is not handling the special case of `timedelta64(NaT)` correctly, leading to an incorrect result in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the special case of `timedelta64(NaT)` appropriately and ensure that the function behaves as expected when dealing with timedelta values in DataFrame operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif (isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and
          isinstance(left, ABCDataFrame) and
          axis in [None, 0, 1, "index"] and
          right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]'):
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
    else:
        # Capture all other cases
        raise NotImplementedError(f"Operation not supported for ({left}, {right})")

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected function, we have added a condition to handle the special case where the `right` is a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. We also check if `left` is a DataFrame and the `axis` is within the allowable values. If these conditions are met, we use the `column_op` function to perform the operation.

With these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the case of timedelta values and produce the expected output in the failing test.
