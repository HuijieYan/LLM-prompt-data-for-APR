The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error when calling this function with a DataFrame and a series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in `test_arithmetic.py` attempts to use the multiplication (`*`) operation in the dataframe which eventually calls the `dispatch_to_series` function and causes the error.

The cause of the bug is that the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function does not handle the case when the right operand is a series with data type `timedelta64[ns]` properly. A conditional check for this specific case is required to handle the arithmetic operation correctly.

To fix the bug, modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to explicitly handle the case when the right operand is a series with data type `timedelta64[ns]` and the operation is multiplication. In this case, it should return a new dataframe where each column is the result of performing the multiplication of the corresponding column in the dataframe with the values in the series.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Custom handling for timedelta64[ns]
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and func is libops.mul:
                return {i: a.iloc[:, i] * b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, a specific conditional handling for `datetime64` series with the multiplication operation is added, and then the multiplication is done for each column of the dataframe with the corresponding value in the series. This will ensure that the arithmetic operations are performed correctly, and the failing test should pass without any error.
