The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be failing when called with the test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`. The issue is likely related to the handling of timedelta64(NaT) in the DataFrame arithmetic operation.

The potential errors in the buggy function include the conditional statements and the `column_op` functions being defined.

It seems that the bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `timedelta64[ns]` type in the `dispatch_to_series` function. When the function is called with a DataFrame and a timedelta64 series, it fails to perform the operation correctly.

To fix the bug, the conditional branches handling timedelta64 series should be revised to correctly handle the `timedelta64[ns]` type. Specifically, when a timedelta64 series is encountered, it should perform the operation in a way that respects the specific data type.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, a specific condition is added to handle timedelta64 series, which should allow the function to correctly dispatch the operation for timedelta64(NaT) as encountered in the failing test.
