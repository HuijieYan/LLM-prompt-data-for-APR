The bug in the given function `dispatch_to_series` is causing a TypeError when trying to perform an operation involving a DataFrame and a Series with NaT (Not a Time) values.

The issue arises from the `column_op` function used within `dispatch_to_series`. It tries to perform element-wise operations on the columns of the DataFrame and the Series, but it doesn't handle the case when the Series contains NaT values properly.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when the Series contains NaT values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    import pandas as pd

    right = pd.array(right)

    if pd.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if pd.notna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- I've added imports for `pandas.core.computation.expressions` and `pandas` to ensure the necessary functions and types are available.
- I'm using `pd.array(right)` to ensure the `right` parameter is converted to a pandas array type.
- I've modified the `column_op` function to handle the case when the Series contains NaT values by checking for `pd.notna(b)` before performing the operation.

With these changes, the function should now handle the case where the `right` parameter is a Series containing NaT values, avoiding the TypeError that occurred before.
