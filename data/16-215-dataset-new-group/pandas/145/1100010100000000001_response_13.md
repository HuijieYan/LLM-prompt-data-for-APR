The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate a frame operation by column, dispatching the operation to the Series implementation. The function takes in `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (a scalar or DataFrame), `func` (arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (a string or None), and `axis` (None, 0, 1, "index", "columns") as parameters and returns a DataFrame.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Inconsistent handling of different types of `right` (scalar, DataFrame, Series) and their alignment with the `left` DataFrame.
2. The conditional statements for different types of `right` objects may not cover all possible cases, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
3. The use of `iloc` and the column index may lead to incorrect or unexpected results.

The cause of the bug in the function is the inconsistent handling of different types of `right` objects and their alignment with the `left` DataFrame. This can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior when performing the frame operation.

To fix the bug, we should rewrite the function to have clear and consistent handling for different types of `right` objects and their alignment with the `left` DataFrame. Additionally, we should ensure that the column-wise operation is performed correctly and consistently for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we use the `apply` method on the `left` DataFrame to perform the column-wise operation with the `func` function and the `right` object. We ensure that the alignment of `right` with the `left` DataFrame is handled consistently for different types of `right` objects. We have also removed the unnecessary use of `iloc` and the column index to simplify the code and improve readability.
