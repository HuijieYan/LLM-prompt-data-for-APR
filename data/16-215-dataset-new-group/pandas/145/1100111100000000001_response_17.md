The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is attempting to operate on columns of a DataFrame by dispatching to the Series implementation. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, including the implementation of the `column_op` functions for different types of input.

The cause of the bug is that the `column_op` functions are not implemented correctly or are missing for different input types. Additionally, the error handling for the remaining cases is not implemented.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` functions need to be implemented correctly for the different input types (scalar, DataFrame, Series). Also, the error handling for the remaining cases should be properly implemented.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` functions are implemented to correctly handle different input types, and error handling for the remaining cases has been added.
