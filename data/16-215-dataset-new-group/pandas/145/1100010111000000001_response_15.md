The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate the frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. However, there are multiple potential error locations within the function that could be causing the failure.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case of timedelta64(NaT) correctly, which leads to incorrect casting. This could be the reason for the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle timedelta64(NaT) and correctly perform the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    from pandas import DataFrame

    def convert_to_timedelta(value):
        if value == "NaT":
            return np.datetime64('NaT')
        else:
            return value

    if isinstance(right, DataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if isinstance(right, str) and right == "NaT":
        right = right.astype('datetime64[ns]')

    left = left.applymap(convert_to_timedelta)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have added a `convert_to_timedelta` function to handle the conversion of "NaT" to `np.datetime64('NaT')`. We also applied this function to the `left` DataFrame using `applymap` to ensure that the correct timedelta casting is applied.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
