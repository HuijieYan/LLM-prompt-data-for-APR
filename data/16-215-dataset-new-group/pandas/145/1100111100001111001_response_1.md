The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of the `right` input parameter, which can be a scalar, a DataFrame, or a Series. The function uses different logic to handle each of these cases. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in how the `right` parameter is processed, leading to incorrect results.

The `elif` conditions seem to be incorrectly checking for the type of the `right` parameter, and the nested functions `column_op` are not being executed correctly based on these conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the appropriate logic is executed based on the type of the `right` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, left, right)
```

This corrected version uses a single `new_data` dictionary to hold the results of the operations based on the type of the `right` parameter, and then passes that dictionary to the `expressions.evaluate` function at the end. This should ensure that the correct logic is executed based on the type of the `right` parameter, resolving the bug.
