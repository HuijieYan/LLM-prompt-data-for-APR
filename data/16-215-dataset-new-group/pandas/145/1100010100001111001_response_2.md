The bug in the original code arises from the handling of the input parameter `right`, which is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` data type.

The bug seems to manifest when the code trie to execute the `column_op` function, which works with the input parameter `a` (a DataFrame) and `b` (A Series). The buggy function tries to apply the `func` to each element of `a.iloc[:, i]` and `b`, but it does not account for the fact that `0` and `1` in the Series `right` are actually representing the indices and not the actual values.

The correction includes changing the column_op function to specify the correct usage of the Series and DataFrame. It should be modified to handle the datetime calculation between Series and DataFrame values properly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}
    
    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[[left.index[i]]]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the case of `right` being a Series and `axis` being "columns" has been handled properly to reflect the correct row-by-row operation. Similarly, the remaining cases have been left unchanged because they were handling the data correctly.
