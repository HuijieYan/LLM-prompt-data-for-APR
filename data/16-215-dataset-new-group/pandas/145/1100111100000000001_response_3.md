The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate a frame operation `func(left, right)` column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The function relies on the `pandas.core.computation.expressions` module to evaluate the column operations.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The handling of the `right` variable and its different types (scalar, DataFrame, Series).
2. The definition of the `column_op` function and its behavior based on the type of `right`.

The cause of the bug in the function is related to the incorrect handling of different types of the `right` variable and the inconsistent behavior of the `column_op` function depending on the type of `right`.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to properly handle the different types of the `right` variable (scalar, DataFrame, Series)
2. Adjust the behavior of the `column_op` function to correctly handle the different types of `right` and perform the column-wise operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(f"Handling of type {type(right)} is not implemented.")

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the behavior of the `column_op` function is adjusted to correctly handle the different types of `right` variables and perform the column-wise operations accordingly. Additionally, the handling of the `right` variable's types is improved to cover all cases and raise an error for unimplemented types.
