The potential cause of the bug is that the function `dispatch_to_series` does not handle the case of a DataFrame being multiplied by a Series with `dtype="timedelta64[ns]"` correctly. This causes the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail, as it expects a certain result from the multiplication operation but receives a different result due to the bug in the function.

To fix this bug, we should add a specific case to handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `dtype="timedelta64[ns]"`. This case should operate column-by-column, ensuring that the dimensions are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and getattr(right, 'dtype', None) == "timedelta64[ns]":
        # Handle timedelta64[ns] dtype specifically
        # Ensure dimensions match
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Generic handling for remaining cases
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected version includes a specific case to handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `dtype="timedelta64[ns]"`. This ensures that the dimensions match and the operation is performed column-by-column as expected. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
