The `dispatch_to_series` function in the `pandas.core.ops` module is not handling the operation of a DataFrame with a Series of timedelta64 values correctly when using the multiply (`*`) operator, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This issue is affecting the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` test in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` file.

The cause of the bug is that the `column_op` dictionary comprehension is attempting an unsupported* operation `func` on a column series and a scalar `NaT`. The purpose of `dispatch_to_series` is to operate column-by-column and dispatch to the Series implementation. However, the current implementation is unable to handle the multiplication of a DataFrame with a Series of `timedelta64` containing `'NaT'` values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of `column_op` to avoid unsupported operations with `NaTType`. We can make changes to the dictionary comprehension to handle this specific case when the operation is being performed with a `NaT` scalar.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters:
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns: DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b is pd.NaT:  # Handle NaTType
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # Remaining code unchanged
```

This modified implementation of `column_op` includes a specific condition to handle the scalar `'NaT'` value to avoid the unsupported operation. By returning `b` directly as the result when `b` is `pd.NaT`, the unsupported operation error is resolved.

With this modification, the `dispatch_to_series` function should be able to handle the operation of a DataFrame with a Series of timedelta64 values correctly, and the failing test case should pass without any issues.
