The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to the handling of the `right` input parameter, which is a Series object. The function tries to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame `left` and apply the `func` to each column and the corresponding value from the Series `right`. However, the handling of the Series `right` is not implemented correctly, leading to the NotImplementedError being raised.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `right` is a Series with an axis value of "columns" correctly. The function is not able to find a valid implementation for this case, hence the NotImplementedError is raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where `right` is a Series with an axis value of "columns" correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle the case where right is a Series with axis "columns"
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected version, I added a specific handling for the case where `right` is a Series with axis "columns", to ensure that the function does not raise a NotImplementedError for this case. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle all relevant cases correctly.
