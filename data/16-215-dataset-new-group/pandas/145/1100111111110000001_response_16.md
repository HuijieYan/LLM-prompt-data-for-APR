The bug is caused by the fact that the `dispatch_to_series` function does not handle the case when the right operand is 'NaT' (Not-a-Time). This causes the error during the test because an unsupported operand type occurs when trying to perform the arithmetic operation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case when the right operand is 'NaT'. We can do this by adding a condition to check if the right operand is 'NaT' and return the same operand without performing the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif right == 'NaT':
        # if the right operand is 'NaT', return the same operand
        return right

    else:
        # handle other cases as before
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the condition to check for 'NaT' as the right operand and returning the same operand, we prevent the unsupported operand type error that was occurring in the failing test.

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the 'NaT' operand correctly and pass the failing test.
