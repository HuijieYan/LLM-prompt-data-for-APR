The buggy function "dispatch_to_series" is designed to evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The potential error locations within the function are the conditions and implementations of the "column_op" nested functions.

The cause of the bug is that the nested "column_op" functions are not correctly handling different types of input (scalar, DataFrame, Series) and the axis parameter. This leads to incorrect evaluation of the frame operation and potential errors when using the function.

To fix the bug, the "column_op" nested functions need to be updated to correctly handle different types of input and the axis parameter. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional statements within the "dispatch_to_series" function and updating the implementations of the "column_op" nested functions for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the "column_op" nested functions have been simplified to correctly handle different types of input, and the conditional statements have been updated to ensure the correct "column_op" function is used based on the input and axis parameter. This should fix the bug and improve the functionality of the "dispatch_to_series" function.
