The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. It handles different types of input for `right` and operates column-by-column based on the input type. However, the error message indicates that there is a TypeError when attempting to perform the operation on the input values.

The problem arises from the handling of a specific case where `right` is a Series with non-null elements. The implementation in the buggy function is not correctly handling this case, leading to the TypeError.

Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue is with handling the `NaT` (Not-a-Time) value in the input `right`, which is a timedelta Series. The code is attempting to perform a multiplication operation (`op = <built-in function mul>`) on the DataFrame `left` with this timedelta Series, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the implementation should handle the `NaT` values in a timedelta Series gracefully, ensuring that the multiplication operation is only performed on valid elements of the Series.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handling the case of right being a Series with non-null elements
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            processed_b = b.where(~b.isna(), 1)  # Replace NaT with 1
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], processed_b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, when `right` is a Series with non-null elements (and the `axis` is "columns"), the `NaT` values are replaced with 1 before performing the operation. This approach ensures that the multiplication operation is only performed on the valid elements of the Series, avoiding the TypeError encountered in the buggy version.
