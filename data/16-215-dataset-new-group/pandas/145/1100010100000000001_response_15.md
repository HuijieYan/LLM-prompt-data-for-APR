The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` is likely caused by the `column_op` function. Depending on the input `right`, the `column_op` function is defined differently, but it doesn't handle all the cases correctly.

To fix this bug, we can simplify the function by using the `apply` method to apply the `func` to each column of the DataFrame in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if axis == "index":
        right = right.reindex(left.index)
    elif axis == "columns":
        right = right.reindex(left.columns)
    
    new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we use the `apply` method to apply the `func` to each column of the DataFrame `left`, and we handle the cases of `axis` being "index" or "columns" to ensure the alignment of the `right` data with the `left` DataFrame. This should fix the bug and provide the expected behavior for the function.
