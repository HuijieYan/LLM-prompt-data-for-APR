The problem with the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be with the logic inside the `if` statements. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. The function is designed to handle different types of input:
   - Scalar
   - DataFrame
   - Series with matching indices and 'columns' axis
   - Series with matching indices

2. However, the implementation inside the `if` statements does not handle the cases properly. For example, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns", the function should operate row-by-row. But the current implementation only operates column-wise which creates problems.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `if` statements to handle each case correctly. 

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
