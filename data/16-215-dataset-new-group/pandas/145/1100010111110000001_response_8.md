The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError` when trying to carry out the operation of multiplying a DataFrame with a Series of timedelta64 objects by calling it using the `*` operator. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` provides a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing timedelta objects and then multiplies them together. The expected result of this operation is a DataFrame `expected` with the same number of columns as the input DataFrame `df`, where each column is the result of multiplying the corresponding column of `df` with the timedelta value from `ser`. However, the test fails with a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types for multiplication.

The cause of the bug can be found in the `dispatch_to_series` function in the case when a series `right` is encountered. Specifically, the problem occurs in the function `column_op`, where the available options are checked, but there is no handling for a Series of timedelta data type, which leads to a `NotImplementedError` being raised when trying to evaluate the operation.

To fix this bug, we need to include handling for `ABCDateTimeArray` and `ABCTimedeltaArray` in the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle different types of operations. 

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases with non-unique columns.

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    # New handling for timedelta data types
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        # Include handling for ABCDatetimeArray and ABCTimedeltaArray
        if isinstance(right.array, (ABCDatetimeArray, ABCTimedeltaArray)):
            right = right.array
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the updated function, the `elif` condition for checking whether `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries` handles the specific scenario where the series is of type `ABCDatetimeArray` or `ABCTimedeltaArray`. In this case, the function casts the series to an array and then performs the column-wise operation using that array.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should be able to handle the multiplication operation for the provided test case.
