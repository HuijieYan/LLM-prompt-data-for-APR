The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values, leading to a TypeError when attempting to perform the operation.

The issue is that when the right input is a Series and the axis is specified as "columns", the function should be performing the operation row-by-row, but the current implementation still attempts to perform the operation column-by-column.

This behavior causes a TypeError when the function tries to apply the operation between a column in the DataFrame and a NaT value from the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns" to handle the row-by-row operation correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `column_op` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":

        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return [func(a.iloc[i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a))]

    # ... (other conditions and the remaining code remain unchanged)
```
In this corrected version, we modify the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a Series and the `axis` is "columns" to perform the operation row-by-row by iterating over the rows of the DataFrame and the corresponding elements of the Series.

This change ensures that the operation is applied correctly and should resolve the TypeError when attempting to perform the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.
