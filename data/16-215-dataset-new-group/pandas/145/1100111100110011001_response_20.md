## The analysis of the buggy function and the failing test

The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` takes in a `left` DataFrame, a `right` scalar or DataFrame, a function `func`, a string representation `str_rep`, and an `axis` parameter. Within the function, based on the type of `right`, it dispatches the operation to a relevant sub-function `column_op`, and then evaluates the result using `expressions.evaluate`.

Looking at the failing test, we can see that it is trying to perform a multiplication operation (`op = <built-in function mul>`) between a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right`, where the Series `right` contains `NaT` (Not a Time) values. This test case is failing due to an unsupported operand type error when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a numpy array and `NaTType`.

The expected input values for the failing test are as follows:
- `left`: A DataFrame with values `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
- `right`: A Series with values `[NaT, NaT]` and dtype `timedelta64[ns]`
- `func`: Multiplication operation
- `str_rep`: '*'
- `axis`: 'columns'
- `right.index` is expected to be equal to `left.columns`
- `left.index` and `right.index` are expected to be different.

### Bug location
The bug seems to be occurring within the `column_op` functions, specifically when trying to perform the arithmetic operation on a numpy array and `NaTType`.

## The buggy function explanation
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is failing when trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series. It attempts to dispatch the operation to a relevant sub-function `column_op`, which is then expected to perform the operation based on the type of `right`. However, there seems to be a bug in how the operation is being handled for a Series with `NaT` values.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the `column_op` functions based on the type of `right`. Specifically, when `right` is a Series containing `NaT` values, the operation should be handled differently to avoid the unsupported operand type error.

## The corrected function

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    # with non-unique columns.

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and b.isna().any():

            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and b.isna().any():
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With the corrected function, the Series with `NaT` values is checked for its dtype to handle the arithmetic operation appropriately. If the Series contains `NaT` values, the operation will return `np.nan`, preventing the unsupported operand type error.
