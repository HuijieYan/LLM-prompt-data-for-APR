The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. However, there are multiple potential error locations within the function that need to be addressed.

### Issues with the Buggy Function
1. The function contains multiple instances of the `column_op` function, which is defined multiple times with the same name and would cause a conflict.

2. The conditional branches in the function may not be handling all the possible cases correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The way the `column_op` function is used within the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to be reviewed to ensure that it is being utilized correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Rename the multiple instances of the `column_op` function to avoid any conflicts and ensure that each instance has a unique name.

2. Review the conditional branches in the function to ensure that all possible cases are handled correctly, especially in cases where the input parameters are of type `ABCSeries`.

3. Verify that the `column_op` function is being used correctly within the `dispatch_to_series` function, especially in cases where it is called with different types of input parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op_scalar(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op_dataframe(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op_series_columns(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op_series(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Raise an error for unsupported types
        raise NotImplementedError(f"Unsupported type for 'right': {type(right)}")

    column_op_func = locals().get(f"column_op_{type(right).__name__}")
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op_func, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function has been renamed to be more specific based on the types of input parameters it handles. Each instance of the function now has a unique name that reflects the type of the input parameters it handles. The conditional branches have also been updated to handle various cases appropriately, and the `column_op` function is being used correctly within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Additionally, an error is raised for unsupported types.
