The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type` when attempting to perform the operation between a numpy array and `NaT` type.

The cause of this bug is that the function `dispatch_to_series` is unable to handle the case when the right operand is `NaT` type, which is not a valid operand for the given operation. This is causing a TypeError during evaluation.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the `NaT` type consistently in all the conditional branches of the `dispatch_to_series` function, ensuring that the operation can handle this type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                return {i: pd.NA for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                return {i: pd.NA for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- We used the `pd.isna()` function to check if the `right` operand is `NaT` type, and handle it accordingly in the conditional branches.
- When the operation involves `NaT`, we return a dictionary with value `pd.NA` for each column, which corresponds to a missing value in pandas.

This should ensure that the `TypeError` caused by the unsupported operand type is resolved and the function passes the test.
