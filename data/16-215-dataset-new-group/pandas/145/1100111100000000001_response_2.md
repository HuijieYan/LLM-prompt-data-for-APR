The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. The potential errors in this function may include:
1. Overwriting the `column_op` function multiple times without any significant difference in functionality.
2. The use of `iloc` for accessing columns, which may lead to issues with non-unique columns.

The buggy function seems to have a bug related to the multiple definitions of the `column_op` function. It is redefining the `column_op` function based on the type of the `right` argument, which could lead to confusion and potential errors.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to refactor the code to define `column_op` function separately for each type of `right` argument, rather than redefining it multiple times within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op_scalar(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        column_op = column_op_scalar

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op_dataframe(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        column_op = column_op_dataframe

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op_series_columns(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        column_op = column_op_series_columns

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op_series(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        column_op = column_op_series

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined separately for each type of `right` argument, and the appropriate `column_op` function is selected based on the type of `right`. This approach makes the code more readable and maintainable, reducing the potential for errors.
