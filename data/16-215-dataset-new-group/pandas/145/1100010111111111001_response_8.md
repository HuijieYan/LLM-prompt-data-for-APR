## The bug
The buggy `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error when attempting to perform a multiplication operation on a DataFrame and a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type.

The bug occurs because when dispatching to the Series implementation, the function fails to handle the case where the right operand is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type.

## The fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type. 

We can use the `np.where` function to check for `NaT` values and avoid performing operations on them, which would cause the `TypeError`. 

Additionally, we need to update the `column_op` function to account for both DataFrame and Series right operands and handle the axis appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        if isinstance(b, pd.Series) and b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], np.where(b == pd.NaT, pd.NaT, b.iloc[i])) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This fix checks if the right operand is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type and handles `NaT` values appropriately when performing operations.

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
