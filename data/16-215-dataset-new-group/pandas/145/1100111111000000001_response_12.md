The potential error in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be in the if-elif block where it checks the type of the `right` parameter (scalar, DataFrame, or Series) and defines the `column_op` function accordingly. The bug might be related to how the `column_op` function is defined for different types of `right` and how it is eventually used to evaluate the `func` operation.

The failing test suggests that when performing an arithmetic operation (`*` in this case) between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64 values, the result is not as expected. Specifically, the behavior of NaT values in the Series during the arithmetic operation seems to be incorrect.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully defining the `column_op` function for each type of `right` and ensuring that the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame and the Series with timedelta64 values handles NaT values correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Check if 'right' is of type timedelta64
            if isinstance(b, Timedelta):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError(b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function is modified to handle the case when 'right' is of type timedelta64. Additionally, the `NotImplementedError` for other cases is preserved to handle remaining cases.

This corrected version should pass the failing test mentioned.
