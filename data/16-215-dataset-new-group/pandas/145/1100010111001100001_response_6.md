The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of timedelta values in the input `right`. It appears the function is not correctly handling the timedelta values when performing the DataFrame arithmetic operation, which causes a failure in the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.

The bug appears to be in the section of the code that handles the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns". The function is not correctly accessing the elements of the Series and applying the arithmetic operation to the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the timedelta values in the input `right` when performing the DataFrame arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # handle the case when right is a Series and axis is "columns"
        a = left.copy()
        for i in right.index:
            a[i] = func(left[i], right[i])
        return a

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version specifically handles the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns" by iterating over the columns and applying the arithmetic operation to the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. This should address the bug and ensure that the failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` passes.
