The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64 values.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing NaT values. The expected result is a DataFrame where each column contains the corresponding NaT value from the Series.

The error message indicates that the bug is occurring when the `dispatch_to_series` function is trying to evaluate the multiplication operation using `expressions.evaluate`. The specific error message is `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, we can see that the problem arises when the function tries to perform the multiplication operation between the DataFrame `a` and the NaT values contained in the array `b`.

The array `b` contains NaT values in string format, which causes the error when trying to perform the multiplication operation with the DataFrame `a`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the right operand (in this case, the Series containing NaT values) is processed by the `dispatch_to_series` function.

The corrected version of the function should convert the NaT values to the appropriate timedelta type before performing the operation. Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        right = pd.to_timedelta(right)

    # the rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By converting the Series containing NaT values to timedelta format using `pd.to_timedelta`, the function will be able to perform the arithmetic operation correctly.

After making this change, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
