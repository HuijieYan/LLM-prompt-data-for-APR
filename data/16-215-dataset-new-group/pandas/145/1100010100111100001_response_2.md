The cause of the bug is that the `dispatch_to_series` function is not handling the case where the right operand is a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]` and the `func` is a multiplication operation. This leads to a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

To fix this bug:
- We need to add a condition to handle the case where the right operand is a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`.
- For this case, we would iterate over the columns of the left DataFrame and perform the operation with the corresponding column values from the right Series.
- We also need to ensure that the index of the right Series matches the index of the columns in the left DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # handle scalar right operand
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        # handle DataFrame right operand
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, other=right: func(col, other[col.name]), axis=0)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # handle Series right operand with axis="columns"
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        # handle Series right operand with dtype='timedelta64[ns]'
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[left.index]))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a new `elif` condition to handle the case where the right operand is a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. Inside this condition, we use the `apply` function to apply the `func` to each column of the left DataFrame and the corresponding values from the right Series based on the index.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
