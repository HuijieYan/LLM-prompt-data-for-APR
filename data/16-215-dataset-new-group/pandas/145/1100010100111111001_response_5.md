The bug in the provided code causes a TypeError when trying to multiply a DataFrame by a Series that contains NaT values. The error is related to the evaluation of the expression involving the NaT values.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case of NaT values when performing arithmetic operations in the DataFrame. We can replace the NaT values with NaN before performing the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # The original implementation of the function has been modified here
    from pandas.api.types import is_scalar, is_object_dtype
    right = right.where(pd.notna(right), np.nan)
    
    new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=1)
    
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case when `right` is a Series containing NaT values by replacing them with NaN using the `where` method. Then, we use the `apply` method to apply the arithmetic operation `func` to each column of the DataFrame `left` and the modified `right` Series.

This should resolve the issue with NaT values causing a TypeError in the original function.
