The error is caused when using the arithmetic operator on a NumPy array and NaT (Not a Time) type. This is the specific error message:
```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'
```
In the `dispatch_to_series` function, the error occurs in the `column_op` function when attempting to perform the arithmetic operation with a NumPy array and NaT. This error arises due to the logic for handling different types of operands, particularly when one operand is a scalar or a DataFrame, and when dealing with non-unique columns.

To fix this bug, we need to accommodate the handling of NaN (Not a Number) and NaT (Not a Time) types in the `column_op` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            try:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            except TypeError:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i])}        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if pd.notna(b)}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we've added `try-except` blocks in the `column_op` function to handle the TypeError that can occur due to the presence of NaN and NaT in the operands. Additionally, we've introduced a check using `pd.notna()` to filter out and avoid operations involving missing or NaT values.
