The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the attempt to perform the operation `op` using the `expressions.evaluate` function. The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, which means the function is trying to multiply a numpy array by a 'NaT' type. This operation is not supported, hence the error is raised.

To fix this bug, the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to be modified to handle the 'NaT' type appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Handle scalar right value
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # Handle DataFrame right value
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        # Handle Series right value with matching columns
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.isna().any():
        # Handle Series right value with NaN values
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the type of the right operand is checked within `dispatch_to_series` and operations are applied accordingly. The approach uses lambda functions to apply the provided `func` to the columns of the DataFrame `left` and the right operand. The check for `NaN` values in the right operand is also included to handle the 'NaT' type appropriately.
