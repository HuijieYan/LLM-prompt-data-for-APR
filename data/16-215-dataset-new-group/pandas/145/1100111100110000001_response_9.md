The error message indicates a "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" when attempting to compute the multiplication of a DataFrame and a Series.

Potential error locations within the `dispatch_to_series` function that could lead to this bug are:
1. The conditional check for a scalar or DataFrame use, as well as `ABCSeries` should be reviewed to ensure correct behavior for different data types.
2. The `column_op` function definition and its implementation for different scenarios should be reviewed to ensure that the correct operation is performed based on the input types.

The bug is caused by a mismatch in the types of the operands that lead to an unsupported operation. The error message is triggered when trying to perform a mathematical operation between a numpy array and 'NaTType' (not a time) type.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for different types should be reviewed and validated for the correct actions to take based on input. Additionally, the `column_op` function implementation should be modified to handle the different scenarios correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b.loc[x.name]))
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns" and right.index.equals(left.columns):
            def column_op(a, b):
                return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b[x.name]))
        elif right.index.equals(left.index):
            def column_op(a, b):
                return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported series alignment with DataFrame")

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
        
    new_data = left.apply(column_op, axis=1, right=right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the implementation of `column_op` is modified for different input scenarios, ensuring that the correct operation is performed based on the input types. Additionally, a ValueError is raised when an unsupported series alignment with DataFrame is encountered. This corrected version should address the issues identified in the original buggy function.
