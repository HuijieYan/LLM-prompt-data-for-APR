The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of `NaT` (Not a Time) values in the input. The `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error message indicates that there is an issue with multiplication operation involving an array and NaT.

The function `dispatch_to_series` is trying to perform operations column-wise on a DataFrame using the given function `func`. It checks the type of the `right` input and sets up a `column_op` function accordingly to perform the operation. However, the handling of `right` as a Series with `dtype('timedelta64[ns]')` containing `NaT` values seems to be causing the issue.

One potential strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the `column_op` functions to handle `NaT` values when performing the operation. This could involve checking for `NaT` values and handling them appropriately to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I've added checks for `NaT` values within the `column_op` functions to handle them appropriately during the operation. This should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when performing operations involving `NaT` values.
