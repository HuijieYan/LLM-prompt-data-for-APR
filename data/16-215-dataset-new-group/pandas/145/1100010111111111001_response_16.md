The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing an error when trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64(NaT) values. The error occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case when the right operand is a Series containing `NaT` values. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle this case, ensuring that the arithmetic operation is performed correctly even when the right operand is a Series containing `NaT` values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # If the right operand is a scalar or a zero-dimensional array
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        # If the right operand is a DataFrame
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # If the right operand is a Series and the desired axis is "columns"
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        # If the right operand is a Series
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles the case when the right operand is a Series containing `NaT` values by using a lambda function to perform the arithmetic operation `func` between the elements of the DataFrame and the Series.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
