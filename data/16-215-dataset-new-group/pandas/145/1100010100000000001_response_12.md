The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. However, there are potential error locations within this function that may be causing the bug.

The potential error locations in the `dispatch_to_series` function are:
1. The conditions and logic within the if-elif-else blocks might not be correctly handling all cases of `left` and `right`.
2. The `column_op` function may not be correctly implemented for all possible types of `right`.
3. There may be issues in how the `new_data` is being evaluated and returned.

The cause of the bug could be related to incorrect handling of different types of `left` and `right`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function:
1. Review the conditions and logic within the if-elif-else blocks to ensure that all cases of `left` and `right` are correctly handled.
2. Re-implement the `column_op` function to ensure it handles all possible types of `right`.
3. Check the evaluation and return of `new_data` to ensure it is done correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == 1:
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is re-implemented to handle different types of `right` and the conditions are adjusted to handle all possible cases. Additionally, the return of `new_data` is reviewed to ensure it is done correctly.
