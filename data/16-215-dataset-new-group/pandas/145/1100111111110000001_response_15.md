The bug in the code seems to be in the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, the issue arises from the usage of the `np.nan` values in the multiplication operation. It seems that "NaTType" is not handled correctly during the multiplication, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

To fix this bug, we can update the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the "NaTType" correctly when performing arithmetic operations. Specifically, when encountering a "NaTType", we should replace it with the correct value or handle it gracefully, ensuring that the operation proceeds without errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            try:
                masked_result = np.ma.masked_array(func(a, b), mask=np.isnan(a) | np.isnan(b))
            except TypeError:
                # Fallback to original operation if the masked operation fails
                masked_result = func(a, b)
            
            return masked_result

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I've added a try-except block to handle the cases where either `a` or `b` (or both) are "NaTType". It first tries to perform a masked operation using the `np.ma.masked_array` to handle the "NaTType", and if that fails, it falls back to the original operation.

By updating the `dispatch_to_series` function as shown above, it should now handle arithmetic operations involving "NaTType" correctly and pass the failing test.
