The issue is due to the misuse of the * (multiplication) mathematical operator in the DataFrame. The error is caused by the attempt to multiply a DataFrame with a Series containing "NaT" (Not a Time) values. 

The bug exists in the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function, particularly in the logic where the special case for handling operations with a `timedelta64[ns]` Series is incorrect. The bug is caused by the misinterpretation of the "NaT" values in the Series, which are of the `timedelta64` dtype.

The cause of the bug is a result of improper handling of the operations when a DataFrame is multiplied by a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The `timedelta64[ns]` dtype wraps Booleans, Integers, Strings and does not support the mathematical operation with DataFrame using the multiplication operator.

To fix the bug:
- We need to implement a better handling strategy for the `timedelta64[ns]` dtype in the `dispatch_to_series` function to avoid unsupported operand type errors when dealing with non-numeric values such as "NaT".

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Add a check for timedelta64 dtype, and handle "NaT" values as np.timedelta64('NaT')
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
                b = b.replace('NaT', np.timedelta64('NaT'))
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The changed part in the function is in the `column_op` where we introduced a check for the `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, and instead of trying to perform a direct operation, we properly handle the "NaT" values as `np.timedelta64('NaT')` before proceeding with the operation. This will prevent the TypeError when performing arithmetic operations.

With the above changes, the corrected version of the function should seamlessly handle the "NaT" values (Not a Time) in a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]` when used in arithmetic operations with a DataFrame.
