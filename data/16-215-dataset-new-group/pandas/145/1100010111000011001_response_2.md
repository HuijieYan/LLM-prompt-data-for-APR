## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        right = right.reindex(left.columns)

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

Explanation:
1. The issue is that the original implementation of the function did not handle the case where `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries` and `axis` is "columns" correctly. This was causing the test case to fail.
2. The corrected version of the function first checks if `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries` and `axis` is "columns" and then reindexes `right` using the columns of `left` before performing the column-wise operation.
3. This fixes the bug by properly handling the case where `right` is a series and the operation should be performed on columns.
4. The corrected version of the function now correctly handles the input parameters and satisfies the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
