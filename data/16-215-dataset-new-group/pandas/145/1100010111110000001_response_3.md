The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` in `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` is that the function fails when it tries to dispatch the arithmetic operation on `DataFrame` and a `Series` with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. This bug leads to a `TypeError` because it doesn't handle the case where the right operand is of `timedelta` type.

The failing test is `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py`. It tries to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. The expected behavior is that the operation should proceed as expected, but the bug in the code causes it to fail.

The error is caused by the fact that the function `dispatch_to_series` does not handle the case where the right operand is of type `timedelta`. It raises a `TypeError` where it attempts to execute the operation.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the specific case where the right operand is of type `timedelta`. Instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`, a new condition can be added to handle `timedelta64` type explicitly and perform the operation accordingly.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # Add a new condition here to handle timedelta64 explicitly
    elif isinstance(right, ABCTimedeltaArray):
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function will now be able to handle the specific case of timedelta64 data type, and the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass without raising the `TypeError` error.
