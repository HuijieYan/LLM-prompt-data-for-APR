The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the use of the `eval` function for operations involving a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values. The error occurs when trying to calculate the result of multiplying the DataFrame `df` with the Series `ser`, leading to a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the special case of operations involving a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values by implementing custom multiplication logic for this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and func.__name__ == 'mul':
            # Special logic for multiplication of DataFrame and Series of timedelta64
            new_data = left.copy()
            for i in range(len(left.columns)):
                new_data.iloc[:, i] = new_data.iloc[:, i] * right
            return new_data
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, a specific check is added to handle the multiplication of a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values. If the operation is a multiplication and the Series has a dtype of 'timedelta64[ns]', a custom multiplication logic is applied to perform the element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series. Otherwise, the remaining cases are handled as before.

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the multiplication operation involving a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values, thus passing the failing test case.
