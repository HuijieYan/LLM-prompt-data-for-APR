In the given error message, the TypeError is raised with the message "unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'". This error occurs during the evaluation of the operation (op) on the left and right operands. The given bug is located in the `dispatch_to_series` function in the `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` file. The bug causes an issue when performing a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT (Not a Time) values.

The cause of the bug is that the function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the case of a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values properly. The function is trying to perform the operation directly without considering the presence of NaT values in the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the NaT values in the given Series and perform the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCTimedeltaIndex):
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    # The other cases remain the same as in the original code.
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check in the `column_op` function for the case when the right operand is an instance of `ABCTimedeltaIndex`. Inside this check, we ensure that the operation is performed only for non-NaT values in the Series.

This fix ensures that the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values is handled correctly.
