The bug is likely within the `dispatch_to_series` function in the `ops/__init__.py` file. The issue seems to arise from the `column_op` function when the right operand is a scalar or a Series with a `'columns'` axis specified.

The error message indicates a problem with the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `'columns'` as the axis. The error occurs within the `masked_arith_op` function in the `array_ops.py` file, specifically when the right operand is a scalar.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is a scalar or a Series with `'columns'` as the axis.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Handle scalar right operand
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Handle other cases
        if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
            # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
            # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to handle the scalar right operand case and Series with `'columns'` axis, we address the issue with the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series. This should resolve the TypeError and unsupported operand issue identified in the error message, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
