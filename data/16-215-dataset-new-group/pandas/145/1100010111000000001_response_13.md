The potential error locations within the `dispatch_to_series` function are in the conditional branches where the behavior for different input types (scalar, DataFrame, Series) is defined. The error may also be related to the `ABCDataFrame`, `ABCSeries`, `left` or `right` not being handled correctly in those conditional branches.

The bug is likely causing the `dispatch_to_series` function to not correctly handle the timedelta64 data type, leading to incorrect results when performing arithmetic operations with it.

To fix the bug, the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the arithmetic operations with timedelta64 data type. This may involve updating the conditional branches to handle timedelta64 specifically, and ensuring that the correct operations are performed for timedelta64 inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas as pd
    
    if isinstance(right, str) and right == "NaT":
        right = pd.NaT
    right = pd.to_timedelta(right)

    if isinstance(right, pd.Timedelta):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        assert right.columns.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[col.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right.loc[left.columns]))
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we handle the `timedelta64[ns]` input by first converting the "NaT" to `pd.NaT` using `pd.to_timedelta` and then performing the necessary operations using the `apply` method on the DataFrame `left`. This approach ensures that the correct arithmetic operations are performed with timedelta64 data types.
