The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes parameters `left` (DataFrame), `right` (scalar or DataFrame), `func` (arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (str or None, default None), and `axis` ({None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}).

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the if-else conditions where it checks the type of the `right` parameter and selects the appropriate operation to perform based on the type. The errors could be related to the dispatch rules and operations for different data types.

The cause of the bug could be that the function `dispatch_to_series` may not be handling the case of timedelta64(NaT) correctly, which leads to incorrect casting when calling dispatch_to_series in DataFrame arithmetic.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the timedelta64(NaT) case correctly to ensure that it is not accidentally treated as datetime64 when calling dispatch_to_series in DataFrame arithmetic. This can be done by adding a specific condition to handle timedelta64(NaT) and perform the correct operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, an additional condition is added to handle the case where `right` is an ABCSeries with dtype 'timedelta64[ns]'. This condition ensures that timedelta64(NaT) is handled correctly without being accidentally treated as datetime64, resolving the bug.

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass.
