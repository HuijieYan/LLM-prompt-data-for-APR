The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of timedelta64 and NaN values in DataFrame arithmetic. The failing test involves multiplying a DataFrame by a Series with NaN values, and the expected result is a DataFrame with the same shape as the input DataFrame, filled with NaN values.

The bug in the function appears to be related to the handling of scalar inputs or Series inputs with matching indices. The bug is likely to be in the conditional branches for different types of input data - specifically, the handling of NA and NaN values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the special cases where the right input is a scalar or a Series, and performs the arithmetic operation on the DataFrame columns appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    a = left
    b = right

    if lib.is_scalar(right):
        b = pd.Series(right, index=left.columns)

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, a, b)
    return new_data

```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the multiplication of a DataFrame by a Series containing NaN values and produce the expected output.
