The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` seems to have an issue with the logic for dispatching to the Series implementation based on the type of `right` input. The function is intended to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching column-by-column to the Series implementation.

The potential error locations in the function include:
1. Conditional logic to determine the type of `right` input and the corresponding action to perform.
2. The definition of `column_op` functions based on the type of `right` input.

The cause of the bug appears to be the incorrect dispatch logic and the way `column_op` functions are defined based on the type of `right` input.

To fix the bug, we can implement a better conditional logic that correctly dispatches the operation based on the type of `right` input. Additionally, we can modify the `column_op` functions to handle the different cases of `right` input appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` functions are simplified to directly apply the `func` operation to the input `a` and `b` based on the type of `right` input. The conditional logic is also modified to handle the different cases of `right` input appropriately.
