The potential error in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be in the handling of the `lib.is_scalar(right)` condition, where a scalar or zero-dimensional array `right` is being checked. The bug might be causing unexpected behavior when performing operations on DataFrames and Series.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform an arithmetic operation (`*`) between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing timedelta64 values. The expected result is that the DataFrame should be multiplied by the Series, with the resulting DataFrame containing timedelta64 values.

To fix the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function, we need to ensure that the operation between the DataFrame and Series containing timedelta64 values is handled correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.isscalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `apply` method of the DataFrame to apply the arithmetic or comparison operator `func` column-wise, based on the type of `right`. This approach ensures that the correct operation is performed when dealing with timedelta64 values in the DataFrame and Series.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` by ensuring that the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame and Series containing timedelta64 values is handled correctly.
