The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be with the different types of `right` being processed incorrectly. The function first checks the type of `right` and then defines `column_op` functions based on the type of `right`. However, there is an issue with the logic and implementation of these `column_op` functions, leading to the bug.

The buggy function is not handling all the cases correctly when defining the `column_op` functions based on the type of `right`. It seems that the logic to define the `column_op` functions based on the type of `right` is not properly mapping the expected behavior for each type.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `column_op` functions are defined correctly for each type of `right` parameter. Additionally, we need to ensure that the conditions and handling within the `column_op` functions are aligned with the type of `right`.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op_scalar(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    def column_op_dataframe(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    def column_op_series(a, b, is_column_axis):
        if is_column_axis:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = column_op_scalar
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = column_op_dataframe 
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: column_op_series(a, b, True)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: column_op_series(a, b, False)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected function ensures that the `column_op` functions are defined and selected based on the type of `right`. It also properly handles the column and row operations when processing the `right` DataFrame or Series.
