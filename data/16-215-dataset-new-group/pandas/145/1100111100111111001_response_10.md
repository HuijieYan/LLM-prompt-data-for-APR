The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `NaT` values in the DataFrame multiplication. The error message indicates that the function is trying to perform multiplication between a numpy array and `NaT`, resulting in a TypeError.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is `NaT` and return a DataFrame with appropriate `NaT` values.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns" and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        return left.apply(lambda col: col * right)  # Perform element-wise multiplication with Series
    else:
        return expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)

```

In the corrected function:
- We directly check for the case where `right` is a `Series` with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and `axis` is "columns".
- If the condition is met, we use the `apply` method to perform element-wise multiplication of each column in the DataFrame with the Series containing `NaT` values.
- If the condition is not met, we call `expressions.evaluate` to handle the operation as before.

This corrected version of the function should handle the case where the right operand is `NaT` and return the expected output, passing the failing test.
