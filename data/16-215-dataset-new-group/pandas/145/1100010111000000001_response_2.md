## Analysis
The `dispatch_to_series` function is used for performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and another object (scalar or DataFrame) by iterating through the columns. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` involves a DataFrame (`df`) and a Series (`ser`) of dtype `timedelta64[ns]` and expects the result of the multiplication to be a DataFrame with the same shape as `df`, filled with the `ser` values.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue could be related to how the `dispatch_to_series` function handles the arithmetic operation involving a DataFrame and a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely causing it to mishandle the timedelta64 data type, resulting in unexpected behavior when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the logic and conditional statements in the `dispatch_to_series` function related to handling Series with `timedelta64[ns]` data type.
2. Ensure that the arithmetic operation involving the `timedelta64[ns]` data type is being handled correctly, and the result is a DataFrame with the expected shape and values.

## Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, rcol=right: func(col, rcol))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col, s=right: func(col, s))
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col, s=right: func(col, s))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `dispatch_to_series` function has been updated to utilize the `apply` method to efficiently perform the arithmetic operation with the appropriate Series, ensuring correct handling of timedelta64 data type as well as maintaining the expected shape and values of the resulting DataFrame.
