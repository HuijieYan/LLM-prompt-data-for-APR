The issue is likely related to the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. The error message indicates a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'. This suggests that there is an issue with performing the multiplication operation on a numpy array and NaT.

A potential cause of the bug is that the `column_op` function is not handling the case of a scalar value (NaT) and performing the multiplication operation incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the case of a scalar value (NaT) correctly. Specifically, it should check for the type of the right operand and perform the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function along with the modified `column_op` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data

# Modified column_op function
def column_op(a, b):
    if isinstance(b, pd.Series) and pd.isna(b.iloc[0]):
        return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
```

With the above modification, the `column_op` function checks if the right operand `b` is a Series and contains a NaN value. If it does, then it returns a dictionary with the index of the columns and `b`. Otherwise, it performs the operation as before.

This modification should address the issue of unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation involving a numpy array and NaTType.
