Looking at the error message, it seems that the bug is causing a TypeError due to unsupported operand types ('numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType') when trying to evaluate the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT (Not a Time) values.

The bug appears to be in the `dispatch_to_series` function, particularly in the `column_op` functions. It seems that the column_op is not correctly handling the case where the right operand is a scalar or a Series with NaT values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` functions to handle these cases properly. Specifically, we need to handle the case where the right operand is a scalar or a Series with NaT values and perform the operation appropriately for each case.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notnull(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if pd.notnull(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added conditions using `pd.notnull()` to handle the cases where the right operand is a scalar or a Series with NaT values. If the right operand is a scalar or a Series with NaT values, we replace the NaT values with NaN before performing the operation.

This should fix the bug and the function should now handle the cases where the right operand contains NaT values.
