The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation. The problem in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case of timedelta64(NaT) correctly, which leads to incorrect casting when calling `dispatch_to_series` in DataFrame arithmetic.

The buggy function performs various checks and dispatches to different implementations based on the type of `right` and `axis`. However, it does not have a specific handling for the case of `timedelta64` with NaT, causing the failure in the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.

To fix the bug, we should add a specific handling for the case of timedelta64 with NaT in the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly evaluate the frame operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and str(np.datetime64('NaT')) in right.values:
            b_nan = right == np.datetime64('NaT')
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: np.where(b_nan, np.datetime64('NaT'), func(a.iloc[:, i], b)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we add a specific handling for the case where `right` is an ABCSeries of type `timedelta64[ns]` and contains NaT values. If this condition is met, we treat the NaT values in the series appropriately and perform the operation with the DataFrame columns. Otherwise, we revert to the default behavior of performing the operation element-wise.

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
