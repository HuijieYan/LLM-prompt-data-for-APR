The cause of the bug is that the `dispatch_to_series` function is unable to handle the operation of a DataFrame with a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. This leads to a TypeError during evaluation of the expression.
The issue arises due to the mishandling of `Timedelta` types in the operation.

To resolve this issue, the function should check for the specific data types being operated upon and handle the operations involving `timedelta64` types correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and left.dtypes.apply(lambda x: np.issubdtype(x, np.datetime64)).all():
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.astype(a.dtypes[i])) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
This corrected version ensures that the appropriate handling is done for the `timedelta64` type, converting the `right` Series elements to the same type as the corresponding column in the `left` DataFrame, before applying the operation.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
