The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the right input is a `NaT` type (Not a Time) correctly. This type represents missing or undefined time data, and the function is not equipped to handle this type in the context of performing arithmetic operations with it.

To fix the bug, the function needs to identify the presence of `NaT` values and handle them appropriately. We can achieve this by adding a specific condition to check for `NaT` values and handle them separately from other scalar or DataFrame inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and (right == pd.NaT).any():
            # Handling NaT values in the Series separately
            def column_op(a, b):
                result = {}
                for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                    if b.iloc[i] == pd.NaT:
                        result[i] = pd.NaT
                    else:
                        result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])
                return result

        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we check if the `right` input is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and if it contains any `NaT` values. If so, we handle the `NaT` values separately in the `column_op` function by replacing them with `NaT` in the result. Otherwise, we proceed with the regular operation.

This correction should handle the `NaT` values in the Series properly and prevent the TypeError from occurring when performing operations with them.
