The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the case where the right operand is a series of timedelta64(NaT) values appropriately, leading to a TypeError when using the '*' operator.

The potential error location is in the `column_op` function that is defined based on the type of the right operand, where the handling for a series of timedelta64(NaT) values is incorrect.

The bug is caused by the improper handling of the right operand being a series of timedelta64(NaT) values. This leads to a TypeError when the multiplication operation is attempted.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific condition to handle the case where the right operand is a series of timedelta64(NaT) values and adjust the `column_op` function accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if isinstance(right.dtype, pd.TimedeltaDtype) and isna(right).all():
            # Handle a series of timedelta64(NaT) values
            new_data = left.copy()
            new_data[:] = np.nan
            return new_data

        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we added a specific condition for handling the case where the right operand is a series of timedelta64(NaT) values. If the right operand is a series of timedelta64(NaT) values, we create a new DataFrame with the same shape as the left DataFrame and fill it with NaN values. Then, we return this new DataFrame as the result.

This fix should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
