The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. The error is raised when attempting to apply the `*` operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing `NaT` values. The error is occurring at line 502 of `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` in the `column_op` function.

This issue is likely caused by the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function not handling the case where a `NaT` type is passed as one of the operands for the operation.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `column_op` function to explicitly handle the case where one of the operands is of type `NaT`. This could involve checking for the type of the operands and implementing a fallback logic to handle the `NaT` type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[:, i]) else b.iloc[:, i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected version, the `column_op` function has been updated to include explicit checks for `NaT` values before performing the arithmetic operations. If the value is `NaN`, the calculation is skipped and the `NaT` value is included in the result. This should resolve the `TypeError` that was occurring.
