The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the input values correctly, resulting in incorrect output. The main issue is that the `func` argument needs to be applied to each column of the `left` DataFrame and the `right` Series or DataFrame individually.

The buggy function seems to wrongly handle the `right` input, which is a Series with a dtype of `timedelta64[ns]`. This discrepancy could be causing the bug.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the different types of `right` and their relationships to `left`. It fails to dispatch to the appropriate operation for each data type of `right` and `left`.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the different cases of `right` types and properly dispatch to the relevant operation for each case. This includes handling scalar values, DataFrames, and Series with appropriate indexes.

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    # Ensure right is converted to item if it's a scalar
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    # Function for dispatching to different cases of right
    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # If right is a scalar, apply the column operation directly
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        # If right is a DataFrame, dispatch column-by-column and apply the column operation
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            # If called via left._combine_match_columns, operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
        else:
            # If right is a Series, apply the column operation directly
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)

    else:
        # Handle other cases
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

The above code handles the different cases of `right` by dispatching the relevant operation for each case, ensuring correct application of the `func` argument to the input data.
