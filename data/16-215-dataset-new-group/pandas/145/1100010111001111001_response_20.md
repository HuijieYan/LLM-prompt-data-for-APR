The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` is caused by a misinterpretation of the `right` input parameter in the case when it's a Series object of the same size as the columns in the DataFrame.

The bug occurs when the input contains a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser`, and the operation is a multiplication of these two. The expected behavior is to perform the multiplication column-wise, with each column of `df` being multiplied by the corresponding value in `ser` (which has only two elements). However, the buggy function is trying to access `ser.iloc[i]` instead of `ser.iloc[i]` in the case where `right` is a Series.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series object representing a column-wise operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDatetimeArray, ABCSeries)):

        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
This corrected version of the function handles the case where `right` is a Series and adjusts the `column_op` function to construct the result appropriately.

With this fix, the failing test should now pass, and the function should produce the expected output.
