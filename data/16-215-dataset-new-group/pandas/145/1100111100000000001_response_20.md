The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the dispatching to Series implementation correctly based on the input parameters. The potential error location is within the conditional blocks where the type of the `right` parameter is being checked and different operations are defined.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional blocks are not correctly handling the different types of the `right` parameter, which leads to incorrect dispatching and execution of the operations.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to refactor the conditional blocks to handle the different types of the `right` parameter correctly and define the `column_op` function accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the conditional blocks have been modified to correctly handle the different types of the `right` parameter and the `column_op` function is defined accordingly to perform the required operations based on the input types.
