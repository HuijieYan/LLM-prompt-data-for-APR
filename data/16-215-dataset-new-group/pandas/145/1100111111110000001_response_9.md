The issue arises at the `dispatch_to_series` function in the `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` file. The failing test case is due to the mismatched datatype of NaT (Not a Time) in the `right` variable. This causes it to be considered as a numpy array of datatype `NaTType`. Consequently, when the multiplication operation is attempted on `left` and `right` variables, it raises the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType' error message. 

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `right` is of datatype `NaTType`, and ensure it is correctly processed in the multiplication operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and issubclass(right.dtype.type, np.datetime_data):  
        # check if right is an instance of NaTType
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        # Handle right as a scalar of datatype NaTType
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: b if pd.isna(b) else func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In this corrected version, we added a check to identify the case where `right` is an instance of NaTType. If that's the case, instead of attempting the operation directly, we use the `pd.isna` method to check for NaN values and perform the operation accordingly.

This should resolve the issue and allow the function to correctly handle the case where `right` is of datatype `NaTType`.
