The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely causing errors in the conditional checks and dispatching cases for different types of `right` input. The function should be modified to handle the different input cases correctly and dispatch to the appropriate operations.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the conditional checks not handling the input cases properly, leading to an incorrect dispatching of operations.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the different types of inputs, such as scalar, DataFrame, and Series, and dispatch the operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected version, the function correctly handles different input cases and dispatches the operations relevant to those cases. Additionally, the result of the operations is stored in the `new_data` variable, ensuring that the correct result is returned at the end of the function.
