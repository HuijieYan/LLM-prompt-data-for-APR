The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the implementation of the `column_op` function, as well as the handling of different data types and shapes in the `if/elif` blocks.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the inconsistency in handling the `right` variable, which can be a scalar, DataFrame, or Series, and the implementation of `column_op` for each case. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function is appropriately defined and utilized for each type of `right` input. Additionally, we should verify that the input parameters and their attributes are being handled correctly within each block of the `if/elif/else` structure.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to define separate functions for each case of `right` inputs within the `dispatch_to_series` function, instead of redefining the `column_op` function inside each conditional block. This will improve code clarity and maintainability.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def apply_scalar_column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        column_op = apply_scalar_column_op
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def apply_dataframe_column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

        column_op = apply_dataframe_column_op
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def apply_series_column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        column_op = apply_series_column_op
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def apply_series_column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        column_op = apply_series_column_op
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we define separate functions for each case of the `right` input to improve code organization and maintainability. Additionally, we use appropriate variable names and follow best practices to enhance code readability.
