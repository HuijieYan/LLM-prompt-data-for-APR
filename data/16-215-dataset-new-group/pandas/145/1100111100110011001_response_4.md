The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is failing because it is unable to handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values (Not a Time). This is resulting in a TypeError with the message "unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'".

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case of operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values more gracefully. It should iterate through the columns of the DataFrame and perform the operation between each column and the corresponding elements of the Series, handling the NaT values appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function `dispatch_to_series`:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the function should now be able to handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values without encountering a TypeError.
