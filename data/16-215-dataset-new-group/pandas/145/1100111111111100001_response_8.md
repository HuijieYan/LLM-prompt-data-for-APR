The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error. This is due to the fact that the function is not properly handling the case when the right argument is a Series of timedelta values, resulting in the mismatched types during the multiplication operation.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case of right operand being a Series of timedelta values, and perform the arithmetic operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype.kind == 'm':  # Check if right is a Series of timedeltas
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=1)
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case when the right operand is a Series of timedeltas, and apply the arithmetic operation along the specified axis accordingly.

This correction should resolve the type mismatch issue and the function should now pass the failing test.
