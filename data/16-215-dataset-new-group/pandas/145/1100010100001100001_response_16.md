The bug in the provided function appears to be related to the handling of the input parameters and the types of variables used within the function. The function is intended to dispatch operations to the Series implementation based on the input parameters, but it seems to be encountering errors in some cases.

Upon analyzing the runtime input and output values provided, it seems that the bug may be related to the handling of the `right` parameter when it is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, it looks like the function is not correctly handling the `right` parameter when it is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. The expressions module is being used to evaluate the column-wise operation, but the interaction with the `right` parameter and its dtype seems to be causing the issue, leading to incorrect values at the function's return.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy could be to explicitly handle the case when the `right` parameter is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype in the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I added a specific check for the case when the `right` parameter is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. This should address the issue and ensure that the function handles this case correctly, leading to a successful evaluation of the column-wise operation.
