## Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is used to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation. It handles different cases based on the type of the `right` parameter and the `axis`. The buggy function uses a nested function `column_op` to perform the column-wise operation, but the logic inside `column_op` seems to be incorrect, causing the failure of the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` test.

## Bug:
The bug seems to be in the logic of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function.

## Bug location:
The bug is likely located in the `column_op` function where the column-wise operation is performed based on different conditions.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions inside the `column_op` function to ensure that the correct column-wise operation is performed based on the type of the `right` parameter and the `axis`.
2. Make sure that the operation aligns with the expectations for the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta64 dtype.

## The corrected version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
