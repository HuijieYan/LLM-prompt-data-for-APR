The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of timedelta objects in a DataFrame arithmetic operation. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` indicates that the function `dispatch_to_series` is not correctly handling the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta objects.

The bug seems to be related to the dispatch rules and the handling of timedelta objects within the function. The `dispatch_to_series` function should be able to handle dataframe arithmetic operations with timedelta data type. 

The possible root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the timedelta data type in the dispatch rules.

To fix the bug, the function should update the dispatch rules to handle timedelta objects properly.

The corrected version of the function can implement the appropriate dispatch rules for timedelta objects as follows:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i].total_seconds()) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and is_timedelta64_dtype(b):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch 
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function updates the dispatch rules to properly handle the timedelta objects within the DataFrame arithmetic operation.

This should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
