The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the conditional blocks where the type of the 'right' parameter is checked using 'isinstance'. There might be issues with the type checking logic and the conditions being checked for each case.


The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling all possible types of the 'right' parameter correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called with certain input types.


To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle all possible types of the 'right' parameter and ensure that the appropriate column-wise operations are performed based on the input types.


Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the conditional blocks have been simplified to handle each possible type of the 'right' parameter correctly. The 'column_op' function now directly applies the 'func' operation to the columns based on the type of 'right', ensuring that the correct column-wise operations are performed in each case.
