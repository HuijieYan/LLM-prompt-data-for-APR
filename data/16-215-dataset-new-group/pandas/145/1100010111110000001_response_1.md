The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` has a bug in the implementation of the `elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):` block. This block assumes that the `right` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame` and then proceeds to assert that `right._indexed_same(left)` which is not necessarily true in the case of timedelta operations, causing the `NotImplementedError` to be raised.

To fix this, we need to check for the type of `right` being timedelta and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif (isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis != "columns") or isinstance(right, (ABCTimedeltaArray, ABCDatetimeArray)):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The changes made in the corrected function include explicitly checking for timedelta or datetime arrays and then handling those cases accordingly, ensuring that the appropriate column operations are performed. This should fix the bug and the corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
