The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the `column_op` function definition and how it handles different types of input. The function is intended to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect assignment of the `column_op` function depending on the type of `right` input. The function definition for `column_op` is not handling the cases correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the assignment of the `column_op` function based on the type of `right` input.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined to accept two arguments, `a` and `b`, and simply applies the `func` to them. This properly handles different types of `right` inputs and ensures that the `func` is correctly applied to the DataFrame columns.
