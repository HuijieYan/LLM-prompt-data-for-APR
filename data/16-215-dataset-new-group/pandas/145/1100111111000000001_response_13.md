The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is a method that evaluates the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating column-by-column and dispatches to the Series implementation.

The potential error location is in the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":` block of the function, where it should handle the case where the right input is an ABCSeries and the axis is "columns". There seems to be a mistake in the implementation within this block.

The cause of the bug is that the logic within the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":` block is not correctly handling the column-wise operation when the right input is an ABCSeries. This results in incorrect output, failing the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic within the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":` block to correctly handle the column-wise operation when the right input is an ABCSeries.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)  
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should now pass.
