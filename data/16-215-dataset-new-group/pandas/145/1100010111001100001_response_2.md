The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of the `timedelta64[ns]` dtype in the `right` parameter and its interaction with the `func` and `left` parameters.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case of performing arithmetic operations with a DataFrame and a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. This causes the test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the arithmetic operations involving `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should now pass.
