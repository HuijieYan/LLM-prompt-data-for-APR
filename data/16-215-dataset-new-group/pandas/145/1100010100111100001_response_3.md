The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType' when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT (Not a Time) values.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values correctly, resulting in a TypeError in the evaluation process.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        # Handle case where right is a Series with NaT values
        def masked_op(a, b):
            result = func(a, b)
            result[a.isna() | b.isna()] = np.nan
            return result

        if any(b.isna()):
            func = masked_op

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a new `masked_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values. The `masked_op` function replaces the NaN values in the result of the operation with NaN.

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the case of performing arithmetic operations with a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values, and the failing test should pass.
