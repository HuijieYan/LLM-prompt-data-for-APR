To fix the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function, we need to address the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType' error that is being raised. This error occurs when the function attempts to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. NaT (Not a Time) is a missing value for datetime-like data in pandas.

The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values. It's likely that the function is not properly handling this edge case, leading to the error.

To handle this situation, we can modify the function to check for the presence of NaT values in the right (Series) parameter and handle them appropriately before performing the operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Handle scalar right value
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # Apply the function element-wise across columns
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, right=right: func(col, right[col.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.isna().any():
            # Handle NaN values in the Series
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: col if pd.isna(right[col.name]) else func(col, right[col.name]))
        else:
            # Apply the function element-wise across columns
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col, right=right: func(col, right[col.name]))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added a check to see if the Series `right` contains any NaN values before performing the operation. If there are NaN values, we apply the function in a way that handles NaN values properly.

This should resolve the TypeError issue related to NaT values and ensure that the function handles the edge case correctly when a DataFrame is operated with a Series containing NaT values.

After applying these changes, the failing test case should pass without raising any errors.
