Based on the input and expected values provided, it seems that the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with dtype="timedelta64[ns]" correctly. This causes an unsupported operand type error when calling `expressions.evaluate` with the operation `<built-in function mul>` and the DataFrame and Series as input.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the dtype of the right parameter and handle the operation accordingly. Specifically, when the right parameter is a Series with dtype="timedelta64[ns]", the function should perform the operation between the DataFrame and the Series along the columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]":
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    else:
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
            new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)
            new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, None, None)
```

This corrected version handles the case when the right parameter is a Series with dtype="timedelta64[ns]" correctly, and it should now pass the failing test.
