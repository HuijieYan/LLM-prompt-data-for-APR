The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for dispatching frame operations by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation using a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the right operand is a Series containing NaT values correctly. It is trying to perform column-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values, which leads to a TypeError because NaT is not supported in arithmetic operations with numpy arrays.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case of a Series containing NaT values and perform the operation accordingly. We can use the `numpy.nan_to_num` function to replace any NaT values with a numeric value (e.g., 0) before performing the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            b = np.nan_to_num(b)  # replace NaT with numeric value
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function now handles the case of a Series containing NaT values and replaces them with numeric values using `numpy.nan_to_num` before performing the arithmetic operation. This should resolve the TypeError issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected for the failing test case.
