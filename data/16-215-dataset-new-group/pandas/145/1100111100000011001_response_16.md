The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `column_op` function calls based on the conditions. The function is not appropriately handling the different types of inputs and is not correctly dispatching the operations to the Series implementation.

To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the conditions and the accompanying `column_op` functions calls to handle the different cases properly and dispatch the operations to the Series implementation as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return libops.scalar_op(a, b, op=func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return libops.dispatch_to_series_op(a, b, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return libops.column_op(a, b, op=func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return libops.column_op(a, b, op=func)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` functions are adjusted to correctly dispatch the operations based on the conditions, ensuring that the correct operations are performed based on the input types. The functions from `libops` are used for dispatching the operations to the Series implementation as necessary.

With this corrected version, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle different input types and dispatch the operations to the Series implementation as expected.

Please note that the actual implementation of the `column_op` functions may vary based on the specific requirements and implementation details of the `libops` module and related functions. These should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.
