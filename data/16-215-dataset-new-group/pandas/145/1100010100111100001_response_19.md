The error message indicates a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'. This error occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation on a numpy array and NaTType.

Looking at the code, the issue seems to be with how the function handles the right input when it is a Series with a 'columns' axis. It tries to perform the column-wise operation, but encounters an error when it tries to apply the operation to the NaT values.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the case when the right input is a Series with the 'columns' axis differently. It should iterate over the columns and apply the operation to each column individually, while handling the NaT values appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Iterate over columns and apply the operation to each column
        result = {}
        for i in range(len(left.columns)):
            result[i] = func(left.iloc[:, i], right)
        return pd.DataFrame(result)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function will iterate over the columns and apply the operation to each column when the right input is a Series with the 'columns' axis. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
