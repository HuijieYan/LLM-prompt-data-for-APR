The potential error in the `dispatch_to_series` function has to do with how it is handling the input data types and the operation being performed. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is specifically testing the behavior when performing arithmetic operations on a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64` datatype.

The `dispatch_to_series` function needs to handle the case where the right input is a Series with `timedelta64` datatype correctly in order to pass the failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of the right input and ensure that the function handles the `timedelta64` datatype correctly for the arithmetic operation.
2. In the case of `timedelta64` datatype, the function should perform the operation element-wise on the DataFrame columns and the Series, taking care of any index or shape mismatches.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    # convert right to a numpy array if it's a Series
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        right = right.to_numpy()

    # handle timedelta64 datatype correctly
    if isinstance(right, np.ndarray) and np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.timedelta64):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=0)
    else:
        # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
        #       with non-unique columns.
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        # remaining code for handling DataFrame and other Series cases...

        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)

    return new_data
```

The current solution should handle the `timedelta64` datatype correctly, perform the arithmetic operation, and return a DataFrame that passes the failing test.
