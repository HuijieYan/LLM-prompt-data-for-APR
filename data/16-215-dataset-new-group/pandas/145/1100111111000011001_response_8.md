The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of inputs for the `right` parameter. When `right` is a scalar or a DataFrame, the `column_op` function is used to apply the `func` on each column of `left` and `right`. However, it seems that the handling of `right` as a Series is not correctly implemented.

The failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to multiply a DataFrame `df` by a Series `ser` containing timedelta values. The expected result is a DataFrame where each column is the result of the multiplication of the corresponding column in `df` by the Series `ser`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of a Series as `right` is correctly implemented in the `dispatch_to_series` function.

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame or Series
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)

        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function includes a modification to the handling of a Series as `right`. It now checks whether `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries` and handles it accordingly, considering the `axis` parameter for column-by-column or row-by-row operations.

This corrected version should now properly handle the multiplication of a DataFrame by a Series in the failing test case and pass the test.
