The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of the `right` input parameter, which is of type Series. 

The function checks if `right` is a scalar or a DataFrame, but it does not handle the case where `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'`. This is evident from the elif block:
```python
elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
    # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
    # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
    assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
```
This block only deals with row-by-row operations, meanwhile, for column-wise operations, there is no explicit handling.

To fix the bug, a new conditional branch needs to be added to handle the case where `right` is a Series and the `axis` is set to "columns". This branch should operate column-by-column and utilize the `left.columns` as the index for the `right` Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)  # Ensure index equality

        # Operate column-by-column using left.columns as index for right Series
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this update, the function should now correctly handle the case where the input `right` is a Series and the `axis` is set to "columns", allowing column-wise operations to be performed as intended.
