The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` is likely due to the operations performed within the `column_op` function not handling the specific input values correctly, resulting in incorrect output. The relevant input parameters and variables used within the function have been outlined along with their corresponding runtime values and types.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the implementation of the `column_op` function to properly handle the input values. This could involve adjusting the logic for handling different types of inputs such as scalars, DataFrames, and Series, and ensuring that the operations being performed are appropriate for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the function `dispatch_to_series`:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the different types of inputs and applies the `func` operation accordingly. It uses the `apply` method to apply the function to each column or row, depending on the input, and constructs the new DataFrame based on the results of the operations.

By implementing these changes, the bug in the original `dispatch_to_series` function should be fixed.
