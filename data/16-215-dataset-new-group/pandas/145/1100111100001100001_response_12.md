The bug in the function 'dispatch_to_series' seems to be related to the handling of the input parameter 'right', especially when 'right' is a Series with a datetime index and the 'axis' parameter is set to 'columns'.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the column operations in the 'column_op' function. The function 'column_op' is designed to perform operations on the DataFrame columns based on the type of 'right' parameter. However, it seems that the implementation of 'column_op' is not correctly handling the case where 'right' is a Series with a datetime index and 'axis' is set to 'columns'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the 'column_op' function to correctly handle the case where 'right' is a Series with a datetime index and 'axis' is set to 'columns'.

Here's the corrected version of the 'dispatch_to_series' function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle the case where right is a Series with datetime index and axis is set to 'columns'
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {col: func(left[col], b) for col in left}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, the 'column_op' function is updated to correctly handle the case when 'right' is a Series with a datetime index and 'axis' is set to 'columns'. The correction includes iterating through the columns of the 'left' DataFrame and applying the operation to each column using the corresponding value from the 'right' Series.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles the different cases for the 'right' parameter and the 'axis' parameter.
