The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be caused by the method's inability to properly handle the operation of multiplying a DataFrame by a Series with a value of NaT (Not-a-Time) type. This causes a TypeError to be raised when trying to evaluate the operation using the `_evaluate_standard` method from the `pandas.core.computation.expressions` module.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `column_op` function to handle the specific case where the `right` input is a Series with a NaT value, and adjust the evaluation flow to properly handle this scenario.

We need to add a special case in the `column_op` function to handle the scenario when the `right` input is a Series with a NaT value and no axis is specified. In this case, we should perform the operation row-by-row.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Case to operate row-by-row when called via left._combine_match_columns
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.isna().any() and axis is None:
        # Case to operate row-by-row when the right input is a Series with NaT values and no axis is specified
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the specific case for handling Series with NaT values when no axis is specified, we can now handle the edge case that was causing the TypeError to be raised. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
