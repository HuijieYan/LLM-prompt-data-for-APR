The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing the tests to fail. The bug is likely to be in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

The output shows that the `right` variable is of type Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, while the `left` variable is of type DataFrame. It also shows that the `right.index` and `left.columns` are both of type RangeIndex.

The `column_op` function defined within the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to have multiple if-elif blocks, each handling different types of input for the `right` variable. However, in the given code, the processing for the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and `axis` is 'columns' is not clearly defined, which might be causing the bug.

To fix this bug, a clear logic needs to be defined for the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and `axis` is 'columns'. This logic should correctly handle the input of a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta dtype. 

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handling the case where right is a Series with timedelta dtype and axis is 'columns'
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis != "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handling other cases where axis is not 'columns'

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

In the corrected version, the handling of the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and `axis` is 'columns' is explicitly defined to correctly process the input DataFrame and Series with timedelta dtype.
