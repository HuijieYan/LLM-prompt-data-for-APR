The cause of the bug is that the function `dispatch_to_series` is attempting to perform arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a scalar or a DataFrame. This is causing a TypeError to be raised because it can't perform the operation directly between a numpy array and a NaT (Not a Time) type.

To fix the bug, the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `left` is a DataFrame and `right` is a scalar or another DataFrame, by handling the individual columns and applying the operation separately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    def column_op(a, b):
        return libops.scalar_binop(a, b, func)

    if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        out = left.apply(lambda x: libops.scalar_binop(x, right, func))
    else:
        out = left.apply(lambda x: column_op(x, right))

    return out
```

In this corrected version:
- The `column_op` function is used to perform element-wise arithmetic operations between a column and either a scalar or another DataFrame.
- We check if `right` is a DataFrame, and if so, we apply the `scalar_binop` operation directly between `left` and `right`, using the `apply` method.
- If `right` is not a DataFrame, we apply `column_op` to each column of `left` separately using the `apply` method, effectively performing the element-wise operation.

With this change, the function should be able to handle the arithmetic operation and avoid the TypeError caused by trying to perform a direct operation between a numpy array and a NaT type.
