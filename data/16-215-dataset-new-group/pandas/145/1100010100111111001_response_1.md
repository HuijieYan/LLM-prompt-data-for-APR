The bug is caused by the function not handling the operation of a DataFrame with a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The error message shows that the bug occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation with a `NaT` value in the Series. The error message also indicates that the bug is located in the internal method `na_arithmetic_op` and the subsequent method calls.

To fix the bug, the function `dispatch_to_series` should be modified to handle the operation of a DataFrame with a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. Specifically, the `column_op` function should be adjusted to handle the `NaT` value and perform the element-wise operation correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_ns_dtype(b.dtype):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if pd.notnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function checks if the right operand is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, and if so, it handles the `NaT` value to avoid the TypeError encountered. If not, it performs the operation as before.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the operation of a DataFrame with a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`, thereby passing the failing test.
