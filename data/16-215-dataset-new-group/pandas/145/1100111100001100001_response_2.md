Based on the input and output values and types provided, it seems that the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'` correctly. This results in an incorrect output and causes the tests to fail.

The cause of the bug is that when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, the function is still treating it as if it should operate column by column, when it should actually be operating row by row.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional branch for `isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns"` to correctly handle the row-wise operation.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":  # handle this case separately
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'` correctly, and produce the expected output.
