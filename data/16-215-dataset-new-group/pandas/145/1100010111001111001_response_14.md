The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of timedelta data type and the multiplication operation between DataFrame and Series, specifically when the Series contains NaT (Not a Time) values. 

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is attempting to use the function to perform multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series that contains NaT values. The expected behavior is to treat the NaT values appropriately during the multiplication operation and produce the expected DataFrame result. 

Analyze the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case of the Series containing NaT values correctly, leading to an incorrect result in the `column_op` function. 

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by explicitly handling the case where the right operand is a Series containing NaT values, and ensuring that the multiplication operation works as expected in this scenario. 

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        # Handle the case where right is a series with NaT values
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and (right == pd.NaT).any():
            # Fill NaT values with 0 for correct multiplication
            right = right.fillna(pd.Timedelta(0))

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have added a conditional check to handle the case where the right operand is a Series containing NaT values. In this case, we fill the NaT values with 0 before performing the multiplication operation to ensure correct results.
