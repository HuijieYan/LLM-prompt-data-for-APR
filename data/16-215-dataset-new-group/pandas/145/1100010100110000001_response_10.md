The error message shows that the DataFrame arithmetic operation fails when trying to multiply a DataFrame with a Series containing NaT (Not a Time) values. This error is due to unsupported operand types for multiplication: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The cause of the bug is that the function `dispatch_to_series` is unable to handle the case when the right operand is a Series containing NaT values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case when the right operand is a Series containing NaT values. Specifically, we need to update the `column_op` function to handle this case as well.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle right operand as Series on "columns" axis
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With these changes, the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function should be able to handle the multiplication of a DataFrame with a Series containing NaT values without raising the unsupported operand type error.

This fix will resolve the bug and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
