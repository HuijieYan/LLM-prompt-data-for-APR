The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to how it handles timedelta64 objects when performing arithmetic operations with DataFrames.

Based on the failing test case provided, the input parameters of the buggy function are as follows:

- `right`: Series containing timedelta64[ns] values
- `func`: multiplication function
- `left`: DataFrame
- `axis`: 'columns'
- `right.index`: RangeIndex
- `left.columns`: RangeIndex
- `right.dtype`: timedelta64[ns]
- `left.index`: RangeIndex

The buggy function seems to be trying to perform arithmetic operations on the DataFrame `left` using the Series `right` based on different conditions and dispatch rules. The issue might be related to how it handles the timedelta64[ns] values in the Series `right` when multiplying with the DataFrame `left`.

When analyzing the runtime values and types of variables before the buggy function's return, it looks like the variables `a` and `b` represent the DataFrame `left` and the timedelta64 values from the Series `right`, respectively. The function then tries to evaluate the `column_op` operation using these variables and the `expressions` module.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to correctly handle the timedelta64[ns] values when performing arithmetic operations with DataFrames. This might involve checking and handling specific cases related to timedelta64[ns] objects when dispatching to the Series implementation.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

It's important to note that the correct implementation of the `column_op` function is crucial in handling the arithmetic operations involving timedelta64[ns] objects when performing operations on DataFrames. This corrected implementation should address the issues identified in the failing test and ensure that the arithmetic operations with timedelta64[ns] objects are handled correctly.
