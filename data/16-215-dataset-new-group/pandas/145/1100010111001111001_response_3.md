The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the way it handles the operation of a DataFrame with a Series of timedelta64 data type. The function should apply the operation across the columns, respecting the index of the DataFrame and the Series.

The issue arises when trying to perform an element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series with `NaT` values. The buggy code does not handle this case correctly, as the `right` variable, which is the Series, is cast to an array of `NaT` values, losing the Series data type.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle the case when the `right` input is a Series with `NaT` values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and 'NaT' in right.values:
            right = right.where(right != 'NaT', pd.NaT)  # replace 'NaT' strings with pd.NaT

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # ... (other cases remain the same)
```

The correction involves adding a check for `NaT` values in the Series and replacing them with `pd.NaT`. This will ensure that the Series retains its data type when it contains `NaT` values, and the operation with the DataFrame should proceed correctly.

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the case of element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series with `NaT` values correctly.
