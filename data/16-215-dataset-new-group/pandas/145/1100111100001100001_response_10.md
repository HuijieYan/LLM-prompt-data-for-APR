The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the variable `right` not being handled correctly, leading to an error when evaluating the new data.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the function is not correctly handling the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns". It should be operating row-by-row, but the current implementation is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns". This can be done by checking the type of `right` and the value of `axis` to determine the correct operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            # operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in right.index}

        else:
            # operate column-by-column
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have added a conditional block to handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns" separately. This block operates row-by-row, as required. All other cases have been handled as before. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases.
