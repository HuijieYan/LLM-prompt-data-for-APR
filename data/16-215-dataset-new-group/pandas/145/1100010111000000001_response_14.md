The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to handling the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 dtype. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is checking whether the operation `df * ser` returns the expected result. However, the current implementation of `dispatch_to_series` is not handling this case correctly, resulting in the failing test.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the handling of timedelta64 dtype when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series. The `column_op` function within the different `if` conditions needs to be updated to correctly handle the timedelta64 dtype.

The bug is caused by the failure to correctly handle the timedelta64 dtype in the `dispatch_to_series` function. This leads to incorrect results when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 dtype, causing the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function within each `if` condition needs to be updated to handle the timedelta64 dtype correctly. This may involve checking the dtype of the columns and the values in the Series to ensure the correct operation is performed.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if a.dtypes == 'timedelta64[ns]' and isinstance(b, Timedelta):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if a.dtypes == 'timedelta64[ns]' and isinstance(b, Timedelta):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With the corrected version, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the arithmetic operations involving timedelta64 dtype correctly, and the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass.
