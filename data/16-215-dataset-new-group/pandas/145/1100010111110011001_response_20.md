The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the processing of timedelta data types when performing arithmetic operations. 

The failing test, `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, attempts to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values. The expected result is a DataFrame where each column is the result of multiplying the corresponding column of the DataFrame with the timedelta Series.

The error message indicates a "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'", which suggests that the function is encountering an unsupported data type when attempting to perform the multiplication operation.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the NaT (Not a Time) values within the timedelta Series correctly when performing the arithmetic operation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the NaT values correctly. This can be achieved by checking for NaT values and performing the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    def column_op(a, b):
        if isinstance(b, pd.Timedelta):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}
        else:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    # ... (existing code)
```

By adding the check `pd.isna(b)` within the `column_op` function, we ensure that when the operation involves a timedelta value, we skip the operation if it is NaT. This should prevent the TypeError caused by unsupported operand types.

With this correction, the function should handle timedelta operations correctly and pass the failing test.
