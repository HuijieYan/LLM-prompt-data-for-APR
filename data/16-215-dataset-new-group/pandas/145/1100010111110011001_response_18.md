The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of scalar values and the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `dtype='timedelta64[ns]'`.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` tries to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` with the same shape. However, the operation fails with a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The buggy function `column_op` seems to be where the bug is occurring. It defines a dictionary comprehension to perform the operation on each column, but the handling of timedelta types is not done correctly.

The strategy to fix the bug is to handle the timedelta type separately in the `column_op` function and ensure that the operation is correctly applied to the DataFrame and Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        ...

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        ...

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        ...

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
            return new_data
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected function, we added a specific check for the `timedelta64[ns]` type in the `right` input. If the `right` Series has this dtype, we directly evaluate the operation and return the result. Otherwise, we continue with the previous logic for handling other cases.

This correction should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` passes as expected.
