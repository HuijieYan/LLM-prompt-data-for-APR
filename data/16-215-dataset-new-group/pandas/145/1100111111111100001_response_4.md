The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values.

The cause of the bug is that when the `right` parameter is a Series of timedelta values and the `axis` parameter is set to `'columns'`, the function should operate row-by-row rather than column-by-column. However, the current implementation is still attempting to perform the operation column-by-column, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the case when `right` is a Series of timedelta values and the `axis` parameter is set to `'columns'`. We should change the `column_op` function to operate row-by-row in this specific case.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    row-by-row, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # The original implementation of column_op still works for scalar right
        def row_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # The original implementation of column_op still works for DataFrame right
        def row_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def row_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        # The original implementation of column_op still works for Series right
        def row_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    # Apply the row operation and return the new DataFrame
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(row_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the case of performing operations with a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values when the `axis` parameter is set to `'columns', and it should pass the failing test.
