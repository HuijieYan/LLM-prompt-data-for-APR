The buggy function is `dispatch_to_series`. It takes in parameters `left`, `right`, `func`, `str_rep`, and `axis` and evaluates the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the conditional blocks where different types of right inputs are handled. These conditional blocks determine the behavior of the `column_op` function based on the type of `right`.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the conditional blocks not properly handling the different types of `right` inputs. There might be a case where the type of `right` is not being handled correctly, leading to a `NotImplementedError`.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve ensuring that all possible types of `right` inputs are properly handled within the conditional blocks. This might involve adding a conditional block for the unhandled type of `right` or modifying the existing conditional blocks to cover all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(f"Right type: {type(right)}")

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I added an `else` block to handle the case where the type of `right` is not covered by the existing conditional blocks. The `NotImplementedError` has been replaced with a more informative message that includes the type of `right`. This should ensure that all types of `right` inputs are properly handled.
