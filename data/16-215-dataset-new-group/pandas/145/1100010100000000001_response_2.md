The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation.

#### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function attempts to handle different types of inputs, such as scalars, DataFrames, and Series, but the logic for handling them might be incorrect or incomplete.
2. There are multiple if-else conditions for different types of inputs, and each condition has its own column_op function. There might be a possibility of a logical error in handling these conditions.

#### Cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug might be caused due to incorrect handling of different types of inputs (scalar, DataFrame, Series) and the corresponding axis and index matching logic.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling different types of inputs and ensure that each condition is handled correctly and thoroughly.
2. Verify the handling of axes and index matching for different types of inputs to ensure that the operation is performed correctly.

#### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)
        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling different types of inputs has been simplified and made more explicit. The handling of axes and index matching has also been reviewed to ensure accuracy. Additionally, the lambda functions have been used to define the column_op functions for better readability.
