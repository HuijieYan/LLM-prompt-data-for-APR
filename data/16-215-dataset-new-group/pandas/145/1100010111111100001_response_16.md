The bug seems to be related to the handling of timedelta values in the `dispatch_to_series` function. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing NaT (Not a Time) values. This leads to a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType', indicating that the function is unable to handle the NaT values in the Series.

The issue may be occurring because the function is not properly handling the special case of NaT values when performing operations between DataFrames and Series.

To fix the bug, the function should have a special case to handle operations involving timedelta data (including NaT values) properly.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        if isinstance(right, Timedelta) or isinstance(right, Timedelta):
            right = lib.Timestamp(0) + right

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # ... (other cases remain unchanged)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we handle the special case of timedelta (including NaT) values in the `right` parameter. We convert the timedelta values to a Timestamp before performing the operation, which should resolve the unsupported operand type error. This will allow the function to properly handle timedelta data and NaT values in Series when performing arithmetic operations with DataFrames.
