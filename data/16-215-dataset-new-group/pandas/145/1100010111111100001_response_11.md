Based on the error message and the runtime values, it appears that the bug is related to the handling of timedelta objects in the `dispatch_to_series` function. The error message indicates a "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'", which suggests that the function is trying to perform a multiplication operation involving a numpy array and a 'NaTType' object.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of performing an operation between a DataFrame and a Series with 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle the case of performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series with 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype.


Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda row: func(row, right), axis=1)
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)

    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the `right` parameter is an instance of Series with a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype. If so, we apply the function `func` directly to the DataFrame `left` by either column or row, depending on the `axis` parameter. Otherwise, we fall back to the original `expressions.evaluate` behavior.

This should address the bug and make the failing test to pass.
