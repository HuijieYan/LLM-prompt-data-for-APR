The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of input for the `right` parameter. 

Currently, the function only handles cases where `right` is a scalar, a DataFrame, or a Series. However, in the provided test case, `right` is a Series with a timedelta dtype and a RangeIndex. Therefore, the function raises a `NotImplementedError`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case where `right` is a Series with a timedelta dtype explicitly, given that the index and dtype of the `right` Series are valid for the operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        # Handle scalar operation
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        # Handle DataFrame operation
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        # Handle Series operation on the columns
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype.kind == 'm' and right.index.equals(left.index):
        # Handle Series operation with timedelta dtype
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I added a new `elif` block to handle the case where `right` is a Series with a timedelta dtype. This block uses the same column-wise operation as the default case for handling Series inputs.

With this fix, the function should now properly handle the provided test case.
