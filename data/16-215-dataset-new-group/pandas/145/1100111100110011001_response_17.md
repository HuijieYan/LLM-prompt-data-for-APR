The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be due to the case where the `right` parameter is a Series with a `dtype` of `timedelta64[ns]`, and the `axis` parameter is "columns". This leads to the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType' during the execution of the function.

The cause of the bug is that the handling of the `right` parameter when it is a Series with a timedelta dtype and the `axis` is "columns" is incorrect. The column-wise operation on the DataFrame is not being performed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case where the `right` parameter is a Series with a timedelta dtype and the `axis` is "columns". This involves modifying the `column_op` functions to handle this specific case properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle the case where right is a Series with timedelta dtype and axis is "columns"
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Convert the Series to a DataFrame for column-wise operation
            b_df = b.to_frame().transpose()
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b_df.iloc[0, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we have added a specific handling for the case where the `right` parameter is a Series with a timedelta dtype and the `axis` is "columns". We convert the Series into a DataFrame for the column-wise operation and perform the operation accordingly.

This revised implementation should now correctly handle the specific case that was causing the TypeError, and it should satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test.
