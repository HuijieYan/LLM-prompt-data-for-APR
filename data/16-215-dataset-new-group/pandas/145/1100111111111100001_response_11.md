The error message and the runtime values of the input parameters and variables suggest that the issue is occurring when the function tries to perform the operation between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. Specifically, the error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type(s) for multiplication ('numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType').

The problem seems to be with the implementation of the `column_op` function, which is used to perform the operation column-by-column. It fails when trying to perform the operation between an ndarray and NaT.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the operation is between a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. We can modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle this case by checking for the type of the right operand and implementing the appropriate behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            # Handle the case of multiplication with a timedelta Series
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to handle the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series of type `timedelta64[ns]` without encountering the unsupported operand type error.
