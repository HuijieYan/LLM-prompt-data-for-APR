The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of scalar right operands of timedelta type in DataFrame arithmetic. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is designed to check whether the function accidentally treats timedelta64(NaT) as datetime64.

The bug appears to be in the part of the code that handles the case when `right` is a Series and the `axis` is specified as "columns". In this case, the function should operate row-by-row, but the current implementation does not handle this properly.

To fix the bug, the handling of the case for `isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` with `axis` being "columns" needs to be adjusted to properly operate row-by-row.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the case of timedelta64(NaT) appropriately when called in DataFrame arithmetic, and the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass.
