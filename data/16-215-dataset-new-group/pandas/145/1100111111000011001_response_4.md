The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior, particularly in handling the different types of input for the `right` parameter. When `right` is a scalar or DataFrame, it should be considered as a zero-dimensional item and looped through column-wise for the DataFrame. When `right` is a Series, it should be compared either row-wise or column-wise based on the axis.

The current code seems to be applying operations column-wise regardless of the type of `right`, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different types of `right` and apply the operation accordingly. We can use conditionals to distinguish between the different types of `right` and apply the appropriate operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    if isinstance(right, (int, float)):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[col.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == 1 or axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
        elif axis == 0 or axis == "index":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[left.columns]))
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for 'right'")

    return new_data
```

This corrected function includes conditionals to handle the different types of `right`. It applies the operation based on the type and axis specified, ensuring the correct results for each case.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
