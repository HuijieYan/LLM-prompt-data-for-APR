The bug is caused by the function `dispatch_to_series` failing to handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame (`left`) and a Series of timedeltas (`right`). The error message indicates that the function is attempting to perform the multiplication operation between a numpy array and a NaT (Not-a-Time) value. This is unsupported and causes the TypeError to be raised.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` so that it correctly handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series. Specifically, in the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is not explicitly set to "columns", the logic should be updated to correctly perform the operation for each column in `left`.

The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function is provided below:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Perform the operation for each column in left
        return left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not explicitly set to "columns", the operation is applied to each column in the `left` DataFrame using the `apply` method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
