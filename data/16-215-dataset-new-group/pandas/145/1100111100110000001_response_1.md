In the provided code, the `dispatch_to_series` function is supposed to evaluate the frame operation by iterating over each column and dispatching to the Series implementation. However, there are errors in the code leading to the TypeError seen in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that when the right operand is NaT (Not a Time), the code tries to execute the arithmetic operation, which is not supported. It's trying to perform an arithmetic operation with a scalar value and an instance of the `NaN` (Not a Number) type, which is causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the right operand is NaT, the operation should be handled correctly to avoid the TypeError. One way to handle this is by performing a check to see if the right operand is NaT and then handle it using appropriate logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        if np.isnat(right):
            new_data = {c: np.nan for c in left.columns}
        else:
            new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we introduced a check to see if the right operand is NaN using `np.isnat()`. If it's NaN, we set the result to NaN for the respective columns. If the right operand is not NaN, we let the `evaluate` function handle the operation.

With this fix, the function should now handle the case of NaN correctly and avoid the TypeError seen in the failing test.
