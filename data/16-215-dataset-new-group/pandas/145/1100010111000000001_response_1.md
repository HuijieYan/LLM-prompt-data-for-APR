The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is failing to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with dtype="timedelta64[ns]". This is causing an issue when calling the function in the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, as it expects the result of the operation to be a DataFrame with the same dtype as the Series.

The bug in the function can be fixed by adding a specific case to handle the timedelta64 dtype when the right operand is a Series. The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if the dtype of the right operand Series is "timedelta64[ns]", and then perform the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas as pd

    right = pd.api.types.to_object(right)
    if pd.api.types.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function includes a specific case to handle the timedelta64 dtype when the right operand is a Series. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
