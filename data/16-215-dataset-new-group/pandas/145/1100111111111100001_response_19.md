The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of `NaT` values in timedelta expressions.

The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, which suggests that there is an issue with the multiplication operation when the DataFrame is multiplied by a Series containing `NaT` values.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the issue is with the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The `column_op` function is returning an `ndarray` containing `NaT` values, which is causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to handle the `NaT` values properly when performing the operation for each column. Specifically, the `NaT` values should be handled as a special case to avoid the TypeError.

Additionally, it seems that the bug is also related to the representation of `NaT` values as strings in the `ser` Series. This representation could be causing issues when the expressions are being evaluated.

Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            new_col = {}
            for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                if b[i] != pd.NaT:
                    new_col[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i])
                else:
                    new_col[i] = b[i]
            return new_col

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, I added a specific handling for `NaT` values in the `column_op` function when the `right` input is an ABCSeries. The `NaT` values are checked before applying the operation to avoid the TypeError. This should ensure that the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing `NaT` values does not throw an error.
