The error is occurring when trying to perform the multiplication operation ("*") between the DataFrame "left" and the Series "right". The error message indicates that the operation is taking place between a numpy array and a NaTType, which is not supported.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the "column_op" function to handle the case where "right" is a Series. Specifically, we need to ensure that the operation is carried out between the elements of the DataFrame and the corresponding elements of the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    # Modify the column_op function to handle different cases
    def column_op(a, b):
        if isinstance(b, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
            assert b.index.equals(a.index)
            result = {}
            for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if isinstance(b, ABCSeries) else func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i])
            return result
        else:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the modified version, we check if the "right" input is a DataFrame or a Series, and then perform the operation accordingly. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the operation is carried out correctly.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
