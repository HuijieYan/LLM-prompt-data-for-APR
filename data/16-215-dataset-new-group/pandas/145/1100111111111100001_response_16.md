The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError` when attempting to perform the multiplication operation on the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser` in the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of `NaT` (Not a Time) values in the timedelta64 Series during the evaluation of the operation. The bug is likely caused by the way the `column_op` function is being defined and used within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Based on the analysis of the failing test and the error message, it appears that the bug lies in the `column_op` function, specifically in the nested dictionary comprehension that processes the columns of the DataFrame and the Series values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function correctly handles the case of applying the operation to a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

Additionally, the code can be simplified and made more robust by utilizing the built-in functionality provided by pandas for handling operations between DataFrames and Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=1)
    else:
        # For scalar or DataFrame inputs
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we utilize the `apply` method of DataFrames to apply the `func` operation to each column of the DataFrame based on the type of `right` input (scalar, DataFrame, or Series). This approach ensures that the operation is correctly handled for different input types and handles NaN/NaT values appropriately.

With these changes, the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
