The buggy function is `dispatch_to_series` in the pandas.core.ops module. The function is intended to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. However, the function encounters issues when handling certain cases, such as the one described in the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting()`.

The failing test involves performing arithmetic operations on a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64(NaT) values. The expected result is a DataFrame with the same shape as the original DataFrame, where each column contains the same timedelta64(NaT) values as the original Series. However, due to the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function, the result is incorrect, and the test fails.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the block handling the case of a scalar or DataFrame `right`, where the `column_op` function is defined to perform the operation on each column.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the case of a scalar or DataFrame `right` properly, as well as ensuring that the other cases are handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compatibility with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda col: func(col, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda col, b_col: func(col, b_col), b=b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda col, b_row: func(col, b_row), b=b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda col: func(col, b))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined using `apply` to apply the `func` to each column or row, depending on the type of `right` and the axis. This ensures that the operation is performed correctly for each case, including the one that caused the failing test.
