The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `NaT` (Not a Time) value in the input data. The error message indicates that the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` is being raised.

The issue here is that the function is attempting to perform an arithmetic operation (in this case, multiplication) on a numpy array and a `NaT` value, which is not supported.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where `right` is a `NaT` value. We need to skip the operation if the `right` value is `NaT` and return the original DataFrame as the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, pd.Timedelta) and pd.isna(b):
                return a  # Return the original DataFrame if 'right' is NaT
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

```

By checking if the `right` value is a `NaT` using `pd.isna(b)` and returning the original DataFrame in that case, we prevent the TypeError from occurring. This ensures that the function handles the case of a `NaT` value properly and returns the expected result.
