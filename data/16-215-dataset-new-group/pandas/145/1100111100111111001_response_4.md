The bug seems to be occurring because the `NaT` value from the series is causing an issue with the multiplication operation within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Given the input and expected output values, we can fix the bug by handling the case where the right operand is a Series containing `NaT`. We can modify the logic to skip the operation for the `NaT` values and return a DataFrame with the same shape as the left operand.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    # Handle the case where the right operand is a Series containing NaT
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.isna().any():
        new_data = left.copy()
        for i in range(len(left.columns)):
            if right.iloc[i] is not pd.NaT:
                new_data.iloc[:, i] = func(left.iloc[:, i], right)
        return new_data
    else:
        # Perform the operation normally
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
        return new_data
```

With this fix, we specifically check for the presence of `NaT` values in the right operand, and only perform the operation on those columns where the right operand does not contain `NaT`. This avoids the unsupported operand type error caused by the `NaTType` when performing the multiplication operation.
