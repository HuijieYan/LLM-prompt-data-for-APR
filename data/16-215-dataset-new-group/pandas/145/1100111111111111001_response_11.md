## The buggy function
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The function contains conditional statements to handle different types of input and dispatches to the appropriate implementation based on the input type and axis.

## Bug
The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when it attempts to evaluate the expression using `expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)` in cases where the function `func` is applied to a DataFrame and a Series of dtype "timedelta64[ns]". The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for `*`: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

## Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to how the function `column_op` is used to dispatch the operation on a DataFrame and a Series. It appears that the issue is related to how the Series is handled in the `column_op` function, resulting in the TypeError. To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the specific case of applying the function to a DataFrame and a Series of dtype "timedelta64[ns]".

The `column_op` function should be designed to handle the case when the right operand is a Series of dtype "timedelta64[ns]". Then, the expressions.evaluate method will be able to compute the result without raising a TypeError.

## The corrected function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError(right)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In this corrected version, the `column_op` function has been modified to handle the case where the right operand is a Series of dtype "timedelta64[ns]". This modification should allow the `expressions.evaluate` method to compute the result without raising a TypeError.
