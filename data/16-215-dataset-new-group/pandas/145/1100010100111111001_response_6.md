## Analysis
The error message shows that the `TypeError` is caused by trying to perform the operation '*' between an array and NaTType. This occurs in the function `na_arithmetic_op`, specifically in the `masked_arith_op` sub-function. In particular, the line `result[mask] = op(xrav[mask], y)`. The input `y` is a NaTType, which causes the `TypeError`.

The problem seems to stem from the function `dispatch_to_series` not handling the case of multiplication with NaT properly when the right input is a Series or DataFrame.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the behavior of `dispatch_to_series` when the right input is a Series or DataFrame. It should fall back to a different operation or handle the NaTType more gracefully.

## The corrected function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    def handle_both_naT(a, b):
        return np.where(a.isna() | b.isna(), np.nan, func(a, b))

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = handle_both_naT
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = handle_both_naT
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = handle_both_naT
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = handle_both_naT
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
This correction modifies the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case of multiplication with NaTType more gracefully. It creates a new function `handle_both_naT` that replaces NaTType with NaN when present, and applies the operator `op` to the corresponding elements. Additionally, we can fall back to this function for all cases when the right input is a Series or DataFrame.

This should prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring when the operation '*' was applied to an array and NaTType, and could also resolve similar issues with other operations.
