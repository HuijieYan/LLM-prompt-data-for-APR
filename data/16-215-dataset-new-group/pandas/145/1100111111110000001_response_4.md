In the given buggy function, we are experiencing a `TypeError` related to unsupported operand types while attempting to perform a multiplication operation involving a DataFrame and a Series containing NaTType values. This error is stemming from the 'dispatch_to_series' function within the file `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py`.

The cause of the bug lies in the implementation of the 'dispatch_to_series' function. Specifically, the 'dispatch_to_series' function attempts to evaluate the column-wise operation between two dataframes, but it's unable to handle the case where one of the series contains NaTType values.

To fix this bug, we should enhance the 'dispatch_to_series' function to handle the case of multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaTType values more gracefully. One way to achieve this is by explicitly checking for NaTType values and appropriately handling the multiplication operation in such cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function 'dispatch_to_series':

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Add check for NaTType and return appropriately
            if isinstance(b.iloc[0], pd._libs.tslibs.nattype.NaTType):
                return {i: pd.Series([b.iloc[i]] * len(a), index=a.index) for i in range(len(b))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the correction, we have added a new conditional block for handling the specific case where the 'right' series contains NaTType values. In this case, the function should be multiplied by scalar number of units and then return a Series with the same index as 'left' DataFrame.

With this corrected version of the function, the failing test case should be successfully passed without any errors.
