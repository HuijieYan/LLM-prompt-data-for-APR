The issue stems from the `dispatch_to_series` function, where there is an unhandled case for the `right` parameter, which is of type `NaT` (Not a Time). The error indicates that the code tries to perform an unsupported operation involving a NumPy array and `NaTType`.

To fix this bug, we should add a specific handling case for `right` being of type `NaT` within the `dispatch_to_series` function. We can address this by adding a check for `right` being `NaT` and returning the left array as the result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # ... (unchanged)
    elif right is pd.NaT:
        return left  # Return the left array, as no operation is possible with NaT
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        # ... (unchanged)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # ... (unchanged)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        # ... (unchanged)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now properly handle the case where `right` is `NaT`, and return the `left` array as the result, bypassing the unsupported operation error.
