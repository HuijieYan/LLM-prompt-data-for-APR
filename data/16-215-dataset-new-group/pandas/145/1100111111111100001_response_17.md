The bug seems to be caused by the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This suggests that the multiplication operation is being performed between a NumPy array and a 'NaT' (Not-a-Time) type, which is not supported.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is a series with a 'NaT' type. We can modify the logic to check for this special case and handle it appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases with non-unique columns.
    new_data = None

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns" and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        new_data = pd.DataFrame({i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))})
    else:
        # Handle other cases as before
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
            new_data = pd.DataFrame({i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns)})
        else:
            # Handle other cases as before
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the right operand is a series with a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype. If it is, we perform the operation between each column of the DataFrame `left` and the series `right`. Otherwise, we handle other cases as before.

This should fix the issue and make the failing test pass.
