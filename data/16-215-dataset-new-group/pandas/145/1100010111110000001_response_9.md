The `dispatch_to_series` function is experiencing an issue due to the `timedelta64` data type involved in the arithmetic operation with a DataFrame. The error message indicates a problem with the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series of `timedelta64` (NaT). The issue occurs in the `_evaluate_standard` function and the subsequent `na_arithmetic_op` function due to an unsupported operand types error.

The bug seems to be related to how the `column_op` is handling the operation with `NaT`, especially for the timedelta data type. It is returning a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the way `column_op` functions are defined to handle operations involving `NaT` values and the timedelta data type more effectively. The implementation should ensure that the operations with `NaT` are handled appropriately for the timedelta data type and resolve the unsupported operand type error.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the `column_op` to handle operations with `NaT` and timedelta64 data type appropriately for the Series when combined with DataFrames. This ensures that the unsupported operand types error is resolved and the function can handle timedelta type operations effectively.
