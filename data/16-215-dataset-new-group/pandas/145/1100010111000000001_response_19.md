The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail. The issue seems to be related to the handling of timedelta64(NaT) as datetime64 when calling `dispatch_to_series` in DataFrame arithmetic.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the conditional blocks that check the type of `right` and the corresponding operations. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of timedelta64(NaT) in the conditional blocks.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional blocks to correctly handle timedelta64(NaT) as a special case and perform the arithmetic operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if (lib.infer_dtype(right) == "timedelta64" and right.isna().all()):
            # Handle timedelta64(NaT) as a special case
            new_data = left * pd.NA
            return new_data
        elif axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the `right` is a timedelta64 series with all NaT values, and if so, handle it as a special case by performing the arithmetic operation with pd.NA (missing value) and returning the result immediately. This modification should fix the bug and make the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` pass.
