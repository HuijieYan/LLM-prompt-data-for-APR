The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the input parameters and the dispatch rules for different types of input. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `right` input and is not appropriately handling the dispatch rules for the different types.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly identify the type of the `right` input and handle the dispatch rules accordingly.

Additionally, the `right` parameter is being modified in the function, which may not be ideal. The function should avoid modifying input parameters if not necessary.

Here is a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right_orig = right  # Store the original value of right

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right_orig)  # Use original right value
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the original value of the `right` parameter is stored in `right_orig`, and the `right` parameter is not modified within the function. The dispatch rules are also adjusted to handle different types of input.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
