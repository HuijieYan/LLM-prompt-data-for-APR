The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is due to how the `column_op` function is constructed and used. The function is designed to perform element-wise operations between a DataFrame `a` and another input `b`, and return the result as a dictionary. However, the input `b` is being assumed to be an ndarray, which is not always the case. This assumption causes the function to fail when dealing with Series inputs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle different types of `b` inputs appropriately. We can achieve this by checking the type of `b` and branching the function behavior accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, (int, float)):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:  # Handle Series inputs here
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.values) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check within the `column_op` function to handle Series inputs appropriately. When `b` is a Series, we convert it to an ndarray using the `values` attribute before performing the element-wise operation with `a.iloc[:, i]`.

This fix ensures that the function can handle different types of inputs for `b` correctly, preventing the original bug from occurring.
