The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing an error when trying to perform arithmetic operations on a DataFrame and a timedelta series. The function is not handling the case where the right input is a timedelta series properly.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't have a specific case for handling a timedelta series as the `right` input parameter. As a result, the function raises a `NotImplementedError` when it encounters this case.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific case to handle the timedelta series input parameter. We can modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle this case by checking if `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries` with a datetime index and then perform the required operation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas as pd

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and isinstance(right.dtype, pd.TimedeltaDtype):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the `dispatch_to_series` function will properly handle the case where the `right` input parameter is a timedelta series, and it should pass the failing test provided.
