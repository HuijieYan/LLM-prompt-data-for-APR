The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be encountering an issue when performing DataFrame arithmetic with timedelta64 dtype. This is evidenced by the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the file `test_arithmetic.py` which triggers a bug when calling `dispatch_to_series` with a DataFrame and Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The bug causes the function to treat timedelta64(NaT) as datetime64, leading to unexpected results.

The cause of the bug lies in how the function does not handle timedelta64 dtype properly when dispatching to the Series implementation for DataFrame arithmetic.

To fix the bug, the function `dispatch_to_series` should be modified to handle timedelta64 dtype specifically by checking for this dtype and performing the necessary operations accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and isinstance(right.dtype, (ABCTimedeltaIndex, ABCTimedeltaArray)):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, a new condition is added to handle the case when `right` is an ABCSeries and has a dtype of either ABCTimedeltaIndex or ABCTimedeltaArray. This ensures that timedelta64 dtype is handled correctly when dispatching to the Series implementation for DataFrame arithmetic.
