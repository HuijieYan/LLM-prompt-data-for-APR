The key error message suggests that there's a problem with the multiplication operation (`*`) involving a numpy array and `NaT`, which is used to represent missing values in pandas. The source of the bug is most likely within the `dispatch_to_series` function. It seems that the function references the `column_op` function which is defined earlier in the file but then gets redeclared multiple times.

To fix this bug, we can redefine the `dispatch_to_series` function in a way that utilizes the correct `column_op` based on the given input types. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the right operand is `NaT` appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op_scalar(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        column_op = column_op_scalar

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op_frame(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        column_op = column_op_frame

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op_series_columns(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        column_op = column_op_series_columns

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op_series(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        column_op = column_op_series

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined based on the type of the `right` operand. We create separate functions for scalar, DataFrame, and Series inputs. Each of these functions applies the given operation to the columns of the left operand and the corresponding elements of the right operand. This should resolve the issue with the multiplication operation between a numpy array and `NaT` that was causing the error.
