## The analysis of the buggy function

The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate a frame operation by column using the series implementation. The buggy function seems to handle multiple cases based on the type of the `right` parameter and its relationship with the left DataFrame.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` checks that the function does not accidentally treat `timedelta64(NaT)` as `datetime64` when called via dispatch_to_series.

The error message indicates that the failure occurs within the `evaluate` function that is called within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The specific error is a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, relating to unsupported operations between a numpy array and a NaT type.

## Identifying the bug

The bug is likely occurring due to the `dispatch_to_series` function not handling the specific case of the `right` parameter being a `Series` with `NaT` values correctly.

The error message also points to the `evaluate` function where the unsupported operand type error is raised.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `dispatch_to_series` function handles the case of a `Series` with `NaT` values correctly. This may involve checking for the specific type of `right` and adjusting the column operation based on this.

We also need to ensure that the `evaluate` function is able to handle the specific operations on the input values, especially when dealing with `NaT` values.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if axis == "columns":
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a.index))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the various cases of the `right` parameter correctly, including the specific case of `Series` with `NaT` values. Additionally, the adjustments made to `column_op` should ensure that the operations are performed appropriately based on the input types.
