The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is that it's not correctly handling the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The buggy function is failing to produce the expected output when tested using the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` test function. The issue arises from the interaction between the different types of input, specifically between the DataFrame and the Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version uses the `apply` function to correctly handle the operation between the DataFrame and the Series of type `timedelta64[ns]` when `axis` is set to "columns". Now, the `dispatch_to_series` function should produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
