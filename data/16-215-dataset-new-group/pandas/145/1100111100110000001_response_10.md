The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The main problem here is that the function `column_op` is not called with the correct type of parameters.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the type of the operands passed to the `mul` operation (multiplication). Specifically, the error message states that there is an unsupported operand type for the operation `*` involving a 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType' (Not a Time). This indicates that there is an issue with handling the 'NaTType' in the calculation, which is likely due to incorrect handling of the operands in the `column_op` function.

To fix this bug, we can address the cases where the right operand is a scalar or a Series with special consideration for non-numeric datatype like 'NaTType'.

We'll correct that by updating the `column_op` function to handle `NaTType` in the case where the right operand is a scalar or a Series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if np.issubdtype(a.dtypes[0], np.datetime64) and pd.isna(b):
                # Skip operation when b is NaT and a is datetime
                return {i: pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if np.issubdtype(a.dtypes[0], np.datetime64) and pd.isna(b):
                # Skip operation when b is NaT and a is datetime
                return {i: pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we've added checks for `NaT` values when `a` is a datetime column to avoid performing the arithmetic operation, returning `NaT` directly as the result.

With this corrected version, the error message should not appear and the function should work as expected.
