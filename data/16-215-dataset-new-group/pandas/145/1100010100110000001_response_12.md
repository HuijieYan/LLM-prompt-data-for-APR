The error message indicates that the * (multiplication) operation is being performed on a numpy array and a NaTType, causing a TypeError. Upon examining the buggy function, the error appears to be occurring on the line `result = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)`, which is calling the `evaluate` function from `expressions`, passing `column_op` as one of the arguments. The `column_op` function is responsible for performing the element-wise arithmetic operation between the left and right operands. 

The bug in the `column_op` function is that it is not handling the case where the right operand is NaTType properly, leading to the TypeError. Therefore, the strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is a scalar or NaTType.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function has been updated to check if the right operand is NaN using `pd.isna()`. If it is NaN, the function returns a dictionary containing NaN values for each index, effectively handling the case where the right operand is a scalar or NaTType. This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the `evaluate` function is able to perform the operation without raising a TypeError.
