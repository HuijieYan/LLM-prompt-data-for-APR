## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate a frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation, column by column.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0` might not be handling the cases correctly.
2. The implementation for the different types of `right` (DataFrame, Series) might be incorrect.
3. The use of `expressions.evaluate` at the end might be causing issues.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the different types of `right` (scalar, DataFrame, Series) leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditional checks for `right` and ensure they cover all possible input types.
2. Modify the column_op functions based on the type of `right` to handle the operations correctly.
3. Check if `expressions.evaluate` is being used correctly.

###  Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    # Convert scalar 'right' to an equivalent zerodim object
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Handle scalar 'right'
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        # Handle DataFrame 'right'
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle Series 'right' with axis='columns'
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        # Handle Series 'right'
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Handle other cases
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    # Evaluate column_op using expressions.evaluate
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been modified to handle the different types of `right` appropriately, and the column_op functions have been updated accordingly. Additionally, the use of `expressions.evaluate` has been retained as it appears to be used correctly.
