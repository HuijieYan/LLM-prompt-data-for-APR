Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The code block that handles the case when `right` is a `Series` and `axis` is "columns" may not be correctly implementing the intended logic.

Cause of the bug:
The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is expected to result in a DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding value in the `ser` Series. However, the current implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function does not correctly handle this case, causing the failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the logic in the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case when `right` is a `Series` and `axis` is "columns", ensuring that each column is multiplied by the corresponding value in the Series.

Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.loc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Modify to correctly handle the case where axis is "columns"

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

Explanation of the correction:
- We have modified the logic within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case when `right` is a `Series` and `axis` is "columns" by correctly accessing the values from the Series using `b.loc[i]` inside the `column_op` function.

By applying this change, the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
