The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError` when the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is executed. The error is occurring in the `evaluate` function from `expressions.py` due to unsupported operand types for multiplication with a NaN (Not a Time) value.

The bug is likely caused by how the function is handling the `NaT` values during the operation.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the `NaT` values properly when performing the arithmetic operation. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function is able to handle `timedelta` types properly when used in DataFrame arithmetic.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    # Convert NaT to a timedelta object for proper arithmetic operation
    if isinstance(right, (ABCSeries, ABCDataFrame)):
        right = right.where(~right.isna(), pd.Timedelta('NaT'))

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we handle the `NaT` values properly by converting them to a `timedelta` object using `pd.Timedelta('NaT')` before performing the arithmetic operation. This ensures that the operation is handled correctly. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass with the expected input/output values.
