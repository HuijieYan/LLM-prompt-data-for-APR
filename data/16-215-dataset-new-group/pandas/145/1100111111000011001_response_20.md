The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is meant to evaluate an arithmetic or comparison operation on a DataFrame by operating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. However, there are issues with the implementation, particularly in the way the function handles different types of input.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` utilizes the `dispatch_to_series` function to perform arithmetic operations on a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values. The expected output of the test involves creating a new DataFrame where each column is the result of multiplying the corresponding column in the original DataFrame by the Series of timedelta64 values. 

The buggy function fails to correctly handle the different types of input, resulting in incorrect output in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `dispatch_to_series` function should accurately identify the type of the `right` input and handle each case accordingly, ensuring that the appropriate operations are performed based on the type of the input.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    if isinstance(right, (int, float, np.number)):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if right.index.equals(left.columns):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right))
        elif right.index.equals(left.index):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        if right.index.equals(left.index) and right.columns.equals(left.columns):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the different types of input and perform the arithmetic or comparison operations as expected.
