The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when performing arithmetic operations on DataFrames and Series.

From the provided failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, it can be observed that the input parameters include a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing NaT values. The test aims to check that when performing element-wise multiplication (`*`) between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`, the resulting DataFrame `result` should have elements corresponding to the NaT values in the Series `ser`.

However, the error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by unsupported operand types for multiplication: 'numpy.ndarray' (representing the DataFrame's values) and 'NaTType' (representing the NaT values in the Series).

Based on the runtime values and types of variables at different stages, it is apparent that the bug occurs during the execution of the function. Specifically, the `column_op` function, which is responsible for performing the element-wise operation, encounters issues when processing the NaT values.

To fix this bug, a strategy involving the proper handling of NaT values in the `column_op` function should be employed. This can be achieved by explicitly checking for NaT values and performing the operation accordingly, or by using Pandas' built-in handling for missing values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b == 'NaT':
                return {i: np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            na_values = b.isna() | (b == 'NaT')
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not na_values[i] else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, specific handling for NaT values has been added to the `column_op` function. Additionally, the implementation considers missing values and ensures that the arithmetic operation behaves as expected when dealing with NaT values.

By implementing these changes, the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test and appropriately handle operations involving NaT values.
