The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be with the handling of the `NaT` (Not a Time) values. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type(s) for multiplication between a numpy array and `NaTType`.

It seems that the function is attempting to perform element-wise operations on a DataFrame and a Series where the Series contains `NaT` values, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the `NaT` values properly. Specifically, when the function encounters a Series containing `NaT` values, it should skip those values while performing the element-wise operations.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.NaN for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.NaN for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we modified the `column_op` functions to handle `NaT` in the Series by checking if the value is not `pd.isna(b)` before performing the operation. If the value is `NaT`, the result is set to `np.NaN` rather than attempting an unsupported operation.

With this modification, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
