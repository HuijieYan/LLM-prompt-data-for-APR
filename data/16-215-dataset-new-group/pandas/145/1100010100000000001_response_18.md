The potential error in the buggy function is in the column_op function where the logic for handling different types of input (DataFrame, Series, scalar) is not correctly implemented. This can cause the function to return incorrect results or raise errors when trying to perform the operation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the column_op function to correctly handle the different input types (DataFrame, Series, scalar) and perform the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the column_op function is replaced with the use of the apply method to handle different input types (DataFrame, Series, scalar) and perform the operation accordingly. This ensures that the function correctly handles the different input types and returns the expected results.
