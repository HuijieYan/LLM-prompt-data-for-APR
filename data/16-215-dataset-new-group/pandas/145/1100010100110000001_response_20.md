The error message is indicating that there is an unsupported operand type error when trying to perform an arithmetic operation on a numpy array and NaT (Not-a-Time) type.

The cause of the bug is the `dispatch_to_series` function in the `pandas.core.ops.__init__.py` file, specifically the `column_op` function inside it, which attempts to perform an operation that is not supported for the given input types.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand is NaT and ensure that the operation is supported for the given input types.

Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if isinstance(right, pd.Series) and right.isna().any():
        # Handle the case where right operand has NaT
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: col.map(lambda x: func(x, right) if not pd.isna(right) else np.nan))
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
        
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the handling of the case where the right operand is a series with NaN values (including NaT) has been added. This will check if the right operand has a NaN value and apply the operation only if it's not NaN.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
