The `dispatch_to_series` function has an issue with handling the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 data type. The issue is identified in the `dispatch_to_series` function at the `column_op` definition where it attempts to perform the operation with a timedelta64 Series.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to handle the multiplication operation correctly when one of the operands is a Series of timedelta64 data type.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the multiplication operation involving timedelta64 data type correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and left._is_timedelta and right._is_timedelta:
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, a new condition is added to handle the multiplication operation involving timedelta64 data type. The condition checks if both the left and right operands are instances of ABCSeries and have timedelta data type. If the condition is met, the `column_op` function is defined to handle the multiplication correctly.

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the multiplication operation involving timedelta64 data type correctly and pass the failing test.
