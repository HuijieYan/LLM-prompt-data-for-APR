The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function appears to be related to the handling of timedelta64 operations in conjunction with DataFrame arithmetic. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is designed to ensure that `timedelta64(NaT)` is not treated as `datetime64` when calling `dispatch_to_series` in DataFrame arithmetic.

Upon analysis, it seems that the issue arises from the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The current implementation does not handle the `timedelta64` operations correctly, resulting in failing tests.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle `timedelta64` operations appropriately. Specifically, the function should differentiate between `timedelta64` and `datetime64` operations and perform the computations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # handle scalar operations
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # handle DataFrame operations
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=axis)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype.type == np.datetime64:
            # handle datetime64 operations
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=axis)
        elif right.dtype.type == np.timedelta64:
            # handle timedelta64 operations
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=axis)
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(right)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)  # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
    
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function has been removed and the operations are handled directly based on the type of `right`. Additionally, the `apply` method is used to apply the function `func` to the DataFrame `left` based on the type of `right`.

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
