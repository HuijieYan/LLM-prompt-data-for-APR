The bug is likely caused by the way the `column_op` function is being defined and executed within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The function is not properly handling the case of the right input being a Series with non-matching index to the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case of a Series with non-matching index to the DataFrame, and also to properly pass the index when calling the `func` operation within the `column_op` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
      
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right[left.index]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass, and the bug should be fixed.
