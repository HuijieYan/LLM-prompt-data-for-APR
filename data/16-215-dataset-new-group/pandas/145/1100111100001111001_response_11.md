There is a bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function which causes it to not return the expected value. The issue seems to be related to the variable assignment and the usage of the `column_op` function.

The bug arises when handling the case where `right` is a scalar or a DataFrame. In the given buggy function, the assignment to `column_op` is conditional and depends on the type of `right`. For the case where `right` is a scalar or a DataFrame, the assignment inside the condition overwrites the previous assignment, leading to incorrect behavior when `column_op` is used for evaluation.

To fix this bug, we need to define a separate `column_op` function for each condition and call the appropriate `column_op` based on the type of `right`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op_scalar(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
        column_op = column_op_scalar

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op_dataframe(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}
            
        column_op = column_op_dataframe

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op_series_columns(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        column_op = column_op_series_columns

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op_series(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        column_op = column_op_series

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In this corrected version, separate `column_op` functions are defined for each condition, and the correct one is called based on the type of `right`. This ensures that the correct operation is performed for each condition, and the function returns the expected result.
