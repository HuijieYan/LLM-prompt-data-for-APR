The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of the `NaT` values when performing the operation. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to perform the multiplication operation on an array and `NaTType`.

The bug may be occurring in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function, as it seems to be responsible for the element-wise operation on the DataFrame's columns and the `right` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the operation being performed in the `column_op` function can handle `NaT` values appropriately. We can modify the `column_op` function to handle this case specifically.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function has been modified to check for `pd.isna(b)` before applying the operation. If `b` is `NaT`, it will be returned as is without applying the operation. This should resolve the `TypeError` occurring due to the unsupported operand types for `NaT` and `numpy.ndarray`.
