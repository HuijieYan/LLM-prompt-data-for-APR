The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how it handles the input parameters and the specific cases for dispatching to the Series implementation.

The input values and types are as follows:
- `right`: Series of timedelta64[ns]
- `func`: Built-in function for multiplication
- `left`: DataFrame
- `axis`: 'columns'
- `right.index`: RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)
- `left.columns`: RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)
- `right.dtype`: timedelta64[ns]
- `left.index`: RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)

The buggy function attempts to handle different cases depending on the type of `right`. In this specific case, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the input where `right` is a Series of timedelta type and the `axis` is specified as 'columns'. The function seems to be trying to perform an operation between the DataFrame and the Series, but it fails to handle the timedelta type correctly, resulting in the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to specifically handle the case where `right` is a Series of timedelta type and the `axis` is specified as 'columns'. We need to ensure that the operation between the DataFrame and the Series of timedelta values is handled accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # (previous code...)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle the case where right is a Series and axis is specified as 'columns'
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Perform the operation between DataFrame columns and the Series
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # (remaining code...)
```

It's important to include specific handling for the case where `right` is a Series and the `axis` is specified as 'columns', to ensure that the operation is performed correctly. This is done by validating the index equality and performing the operation between the DataFrame columns and the Series.

The corrected function should now accurately handle the case described and return the expected result.
