The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameters. The function is not dispatching correctly to the Series implementation for the given inputs, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dispatching logic correctly handles the different types of input parameters, such as DataFrame, Series, and scalar values, and applies the function to each column or row as appropriate.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    a = left
    b = right
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        b = pd.Series([right] * len(left.columns))

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, a, b)
    return new_data
```

By making sure that the input parameters are correctly handled and the function is applied to each column or row as appropriate, the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test.
