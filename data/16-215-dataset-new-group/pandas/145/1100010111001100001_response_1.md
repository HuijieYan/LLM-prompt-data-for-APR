The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` is causing the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to not pass. The failing test is specifically checking if timedelta64(NaT) is being treated as datetime64, and the function is failing to produce the expected result.

The bug is likely occurring in the logic for handling the case when `right` is a series and `axis` is "columns". The function is not correctly handling the case where the `right` series index equals the `left` dataframe columns.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic for handling the case when `right` is a series and `axis` is "columns". This modification should ensure that the function operates row-by-row to match the index of the right series with the columns of the left dataframe.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)  # Ensure index matches columns

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i].values, b.values) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass.
