The buggy function has an error in the logic for handling the different data types and shapes of the 'right' input parameter. This causes the function to return unexpected results.

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect handling of different data types and shapes of the 'right' input parameter, leading to incorrect column-wise operations.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling different data types and shapes of the 'right' input parameter, and ensure that the operations are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compatibility with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = left.apply(lambda col: column_op(col, right))
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles the different scenarios for the 'right' input parameter and ensures that the operations are performed correctly based on the input types and shapes.
