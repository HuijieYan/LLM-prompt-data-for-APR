The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` has several potential error locations. 

1. The conditional statements are not mutually exclusive. Specifically, the conditional statements `if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0` and `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns"` both can be True for the same input causing ambiguity.
2. The usage of the `column_op` function is not clear and it's producing a dictionary which might not be the expected return type.

The cause of the bug in the current implementation is that the conditional statements are not mutually exclusive, which can lead to ambiguity in function dispatch. Also, the `column_op` function is returning a dictionary instead of the expected DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements should be rewritten to be mutually exclusive and clearly defined, and the `column_op` function should be modified to return a DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    data = [column_op(left[col], right) for col in left.columns]
    new_data = pd.concat(data, axis=1)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements are rewritten to be mutually exclusive and clearly defined. The `column_op` function now takes a column `a` and a value `b` as input and applies the function `func` to them. Then, a list comprehension is used to apply `column_op` to each column of the DataFrame and finally, the results are concatenated into a new DataFrame.
