The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how it handles the input `right` when it's a Series and the `axis` is set to "columns". The code is trying to iterate over columns while accessing the index of the `right` Series, but it seems to be handling the index incorrectly.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug could be to modify the code block that handles the case where `right` is an instance of ABCSeries and `axis` is set to "columns". Specifically, the code related to `assert right.index.equals(left.columns)` and the subsequent definition of `column_op` may need adjustments.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Ensure both indices are the same

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the code block handling the case where `right` is an instance of ABCSeries and `axis` is set to "columns" has been modified to ensure that both indices (of `right` and `left`) are the same before defining `column_op`.

This should address the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for the given input scenarios.
