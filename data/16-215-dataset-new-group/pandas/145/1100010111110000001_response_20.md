The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is causing the test to fail due to an issue with handling the operation between the DataFrame and the Series with `NaT` values. 

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values properly. The error message suggests that there is an "unsupported operand type" error when applying the multiplication operation between a numpy array and 'NaTType' (Not a Time) value.

To fix the bug, the `dispatch_to_series` function should be modified to handle the operation with `NaT` values correctly. Specifically, we need to handle the case where the right operand contains `NaT` values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(b.dtype):  # Check if the Series is of type timedelta
                b = b.astype(left.dtypes)
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for the `right` operand to see if it's a Series of type timedelta (timedelta64[ns]) and cast it to the dtype of the DataFrame before performing the operation.

This modified version properly handles the operation with `NaT` values, ensuring that the correct data type compatibility is maintained during the operation.
