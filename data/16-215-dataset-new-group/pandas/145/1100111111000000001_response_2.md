## Identify the potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `column_op` function is defined multiple times with the same signature, which can cause ambiguity and potential errors.
2. The logic for handling different types of inputs (scalar, DataFrame, Series) within the `dispatch_to_series` function might not be correctly implemented.
3. The use of the `expressions.evaluate` method within the `dispatch_to_series` function might not be handling the input correctly.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the failing test:
The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` aims to check the behavior of the DataFrame arithmetic operation when multiplying a DataFrame with a Series containing timedelta64(NaT) values. The expected result is to have a DataFrame with the same shape as the original DataFrame, where each value is replaced by `NaT` if the corresponding value in the Series is `NaT`. However, the current implementation of `dispatch_to_series` does not handle this case correctly, leading to incorrect results.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle different input types (scalar, DataFrame, Series) appropriately and perform the operation correctly.
2. Ensure that the `expressions.evaluate` method is used accurately to evaluate the column-wise operation in the DataFrame.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=0):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == 1:
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle different input types and perform the column-wise operation accurately, which will fix the bug and ensure that it passes the failing test.
