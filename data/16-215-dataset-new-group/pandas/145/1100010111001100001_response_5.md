The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64` dtype and the `axis` is "columns". The function is only handling the case where `right` is a scalar, a DataFrame, or a Series with the same index as the left DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't have a specific implementation for the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64` dtype and the `axis` is "columns". This causes the test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail, as it is specifically testing this case and expecting a specific output from the function.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific implementation for the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64` dtype and the `axis` is "columns". We can achieve this by modifying the function to check for this specific case and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function includes a specific implementation for the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64` dtype and the `axis` is "columns". Now, the function should pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
