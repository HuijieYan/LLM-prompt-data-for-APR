The cause of the bug in the buggy function is that it does not correctly dispatch the operation based on the input types. It attempts to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching column-by-column, but the implementation of the `column_op` functions seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dispatch_to_series function correctly handles different input types and dispatches the operation according to the types of the input.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    if isinstance(right, (int, float)):
        # Right is a scalar
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        # Right is a DataFrame
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == 1:
        # Right is a Series and axis is "columns"
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == 0:
        # Right is a Series and axis is "index"
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
        
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles different input types for `right` and dispatches the operation based on the types. It uses the `apply` method to apply the function `func` to each column of the DataFrame `left` based on the conditions specified.
