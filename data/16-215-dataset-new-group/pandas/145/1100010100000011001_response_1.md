## Analysis
The buggy function seems to be using the input parameters `left` and `right` to perform some arithmetic or comparison operation. It is then iterating through the columns of the `left` DataFrame and applying the operation to each column. It has different conditions based on the type of `right` and the `axis`. The buggy function uses `column_op` as a function to apply to the columns of the `left` DataFrame.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are within the conditional blocks for different types of `right` and the use of `column_op` to operate on the columns of the `left` DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect conditional checks for the type of `right` and the axis. Additionally, the `column_op` function might not be correctly implemented for all cases.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully analyze the conditional blocks, check the type of `right` and `axis` correctly, and ensure that the `column_op` function is implemented correctly for each case.

## Bug Fix
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version should handle different types of `right` and `axis` correctly, and the `column_op` function is implemented to apply the operation correctly to the columns of the `left` DataFrame for each case.
