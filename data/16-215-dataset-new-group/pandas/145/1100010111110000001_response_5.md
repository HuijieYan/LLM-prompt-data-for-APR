Potential issues in the `dispatch_to_series` function:
1. The function uses `iloc` which isn't the correct way to access columns or elements in a DataFrame.
2. There's also a complex set of conditions for the four different types of `right` input, which may not be necessary.

The problem occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function tries to evaluate the operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing `NaT` values. The error message suggests that there is an unsupported operand type for '*' between `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the conditions around how different types of `right` input are handled.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    return new_data
```
