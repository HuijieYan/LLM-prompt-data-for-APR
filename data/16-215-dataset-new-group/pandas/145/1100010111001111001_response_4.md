The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` is likely due to the incorrect assignment of the `right` variable within the function, causing issues with the column-wise operation in the case where `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries` and the `axis` is not "columns". 

The strategy to fix this bug is to update the column_op function to handle the case where `right` is an instance of ABCSeries and the `axis` is not "columns" as this is the condition that is failing. The fix involves adding an additional else statement to the function that handles this specific case.

The corrected function is presented below:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis != "columns":
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected function, the failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass.
