The buggy function dispatch_to_series is raising a TypeError when evaluating the expression using expressions.evaluate. The specific error is occurring due to the unsupported operand type(s) for the numpy array and 'NaTType' when attempting the multiplication operation within the evaluate method.

The cause of the bug is that the multiplication operation is being performed between the dataframe and a series containing 'NaT'. The operation is not supported, and it leads to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the column_op function inside the dispatch_to_series function to handle the case when NaN or NaT is encountered. 

The corrected version of the dispatch_to_series function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle NaN or NaT
            result = np.empty(len(a.columns))
            for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                if b.iloc[i] is pd.NaT or np.isnan(b.iloc[i]):
                    result[i] = np.nan
                else:
                    result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])
            return {i: result[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the modified column_op for the right operand being an ABCSeries, we added a check for both pd.NaT and np.isnan, treating them as NaN when encountered. This way, the multiplication operation will result in NaN when the right operand is 'NaT'.

With these changes, the corrected version of the dispatch_to_series should pass the failing test provided.
