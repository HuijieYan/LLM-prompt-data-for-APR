The bug is caused by the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values in the `dispatch_to_series` function when performing the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The current implementation of the `column_op` function fails to handle this case, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `right` parameter is a Series with NaT values.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the `column_op` function now directly applies the `func` operation to the entire DataFrame and Series, handling the case where the Series contains NaT values.

By making this change, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values correctly.

This should resolve the TypeError that was occurring in the failing test.
