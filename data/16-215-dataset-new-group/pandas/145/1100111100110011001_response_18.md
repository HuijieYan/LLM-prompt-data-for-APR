The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation by iterating through the columns of the input DataFrame. The error occurs due to an unsupported operation type for the combination of a numpy array and NaTType.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional statements that determine the type of the right input parameter, and the subsequent creation of the `column_op` function to operate on the columns of the DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is that the implementation of the `column_op` function to handle the case when `right` is a scalar is incorrect. This leads to the unsupported operation type error when attempting to use the `func` operation on the columns of the DataFrame and the scalar NaT value.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to correctly handle the case when `right` is a scalar, ensuring that the `column_op` function properly handles the scalar value and applies the `func` operation to the columns of the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, lambda functions are used to define the `column_op` based on the type of the `right` input. This ensures that the `column_op` function is correctly defined for each case, allowing the `func` operation to be applied to the columns of the DataFrame and the `right` input without error.
