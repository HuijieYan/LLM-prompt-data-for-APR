The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` in the file `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` is causing an issue with the test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py`.

The potential error location in the buggy function is within the if-elif-else block that checks the type of the `right` input. The error could be related to how the function is dispatching to the Series implementation based on the type of the `right` input.

The cause of the bug is that the `dispatch_to_series` function is not handling the case of timedelta64(NaT) properly when called in DataFrame arithmetic, which leads to incorrect results in the failing test.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to explicitly handle the case of "timedelta64[ns]" in the `dispatch_to_series` function and ensure that it is properly dispatched to the Series implementation.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and isinstance(right.array, ABCTimedeltaArray) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now properly handle the case of "timedelta64[ns]" and pass the failing test.
