## Analysis
The error message suggests that the bug is within the `dispatch_to_series` function in the `pandas.core.ops.__init__.py` file. The error specifically indicates that an unsupported operand type for multiplication is being used. This means that the bug is most likely related to the handling of the multiplication operation in `dispatch_to_series` when the right operand is a `NaT` value.

## Bug
The bug occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` is called to evaluate the multiplication of a DataFrame with a Series that contains a `NaT` value. Consequently, the function fails to handle this case, resulting in an unsupported operand type error.

## Strategy
The strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle the case where the `right` operand is a `NaT` value within the `dispatch_to_series` function and provide a valid operation for this case.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif right is pd.NaT:
        if func is np.multiply:
            new_data = expressions.evaluate(lambda a, b: a, str_rep, left, right)
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(func)
        return new_data

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected version, a check is implemented to handle the case where the right operand is a `NaT` value. If the function used for the operation is a multiply, then it returns the `left` DataFrame as it is for each column. For any other function, a `NotImplementedError` is raised.
