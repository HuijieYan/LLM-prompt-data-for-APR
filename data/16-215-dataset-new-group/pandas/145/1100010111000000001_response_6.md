## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. It handles different cases based on the type of `right` and the `axis` parameter.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is checking whether calling `dispatch_to_series` in DataFrame arithmetic will accidentally treat `timedelta64(NaT)` as `datetime64`. The test provides a specific scenario where a DataFrame is multiplied by a Series containing `NaT` values of type `timedelta64[ns]`.

## Bug:
The bug is likely to be in the `dispatch_to_series` function when dealing with the `timedelta64` type. The function may be incorrectly treating `timedelta64(NaT)` as `datetime64` in certain cases, leading to incorrect evaluation and failing the test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions and the flow of the `dispatch_to_series` function, focusing on how it handles `timedelta64` types.
2. Ensure that the function appropriately recognizes `timedelta64` and processes it correctly without treating it as `datetime64`.
3. Debug and test the modified function with the failing test to verify the fix.

## Corrected version of the function:

```

In the corrected version of the function, I've added a condition to handle the case when `right` is an instance of `ABCTimedeltaArray`. Within this condition, I've checked if `right` is a `timedelta64` type with `NaT` values. If it is, the function correctly processes the `NaT` values as `Timedelta('NaT')` in the column-wise operation. If it's not a timedelta64 type or has other characteristics, it raises a `NotImplementedError`.
