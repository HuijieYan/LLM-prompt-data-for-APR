The cause of the bug is that the function `dispatch_to_series` is not correctly handling the case where `right` is a series and `axis` is `'columns'`. 

The buggy function is not properly handling the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is 'columns'. It is not correctly applying the function to each column of the DataFrame `a` and the corresponding values of the Series `b`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to handle this case correctly and return the result as a DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        data = {}
        for i, column in left.items():
            data[i] = func(column, right)
        new_data = pd.DataFrame(data)
        return new_data

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    # rest of the function implementation ...
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns". We iterate through the columns of the `left` DataFrame and apply the function to each column with the corresponding values from the Series `right`. The results are then combined into a new DataFrame `new_data` and returned.
