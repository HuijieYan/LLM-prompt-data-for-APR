The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of timedelta and datetime operations in the `column_op` function.

The function `column_op` is called with parameters a and b, where a is a DataFrame and b is a Series. When a DataFrame is multiplied by a Series, it should perform the operation element-wise. However, the current implementation of `column_op` does not handle this correctly, leading to unexpected results in the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when a DataFrame is combined with a Series in the `dispatch_to_series` function, ensuring that the operation is performed correctly between the elements of the DataFrame and the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[col.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we use the `apply` method on the DataFrame `left` to apply the function `func` to each column of the DataFrame with the corresponding element(s) from the Series `right`.

With this corrected version, the `dispatch_to_series` function should handle the timedelta and datetime operations correctly, and the failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass.
