The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate a frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes in parameters `left`, `right`, `func`, `str_rep`, and `axis`, and returns a DataFrame.

After analyzing the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables before the function's return, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the case of a Series as the `right` input with `axis='columns'`.

The specific issue arises when `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'`. In this case, the function should operate row-by-row, but it seems to be attempting to operate column-by-column, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the case of a Series as `right` with `axis='columns'`. This can be done by adjusting the logic for the `column_op` function to correctly operate row-by-row in this specific case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Operate row-by-row for case of Series with axis='columns'
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the logic for the `column_op` function has been adjusted to correctly operate row-by-row when `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'`. This should address the bug and ensure that the function handles this case as expected.
