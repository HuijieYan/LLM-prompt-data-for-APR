The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the if-elif-else chain where different types of `right` are being handled. The bug occurs because the `column_op` function is being redefined for each conditional block, which can cause unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the `column_op` function is being redefined based on the type of `right` in each conditional block. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the code.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to define the `column_op` function outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function and then use it consistently within the conditional blocks to avoid redefining it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/ops/__init__.py

import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def column_op(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op_func = column_op

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op_func = column_op

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op_func = column_op

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        column_op_func = column_op

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op_func, str_rep, left, right, func)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function and then the `column_op_func` variable is used within each conditional block to consistently apply the same function. This ensures that the `column_op` function is not redefined based on the type of `right`, fixing the bug.
