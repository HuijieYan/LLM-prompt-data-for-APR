The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values.

The issue seems to be in the `column_op` function, specifically in the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not "columns". This situation raises an assertion error that leads to the implementation of a dictionary comprehension that uses the `func` with `a.iloc[:, i]` and `b.iloc[i]`. However, this causes a TypeError due to the unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation.

To fix the bug, we should handle the operations differently for different types of input. Specifically, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not "columns", we should perform the operations row-by-row, using `a.iloc[i]` and `b` instead of `a.iloc[:, i]` and `b.iloc[i]`.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the various cases for `right` and perform the operations accordingly without raising a TypeError.
