The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how the `column_op` function is being defined and used based on the different types of input. The bug occurs when the input `right` is a Series and the `axis` is set to "columns". In this case, the function isn't handling the operation correctly.

Also, in the failing test case, the input `ser` is a Series containing timedelta64 values, and the input `df` is a DataFrame. The test then checks if the result of multiplying `df` by `ser` matches the expected DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function correctly handles the operations for different input types and axes. We can use a conditional statement to switch between different behaviors based on the input types and values.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version properly handles the different types of input and the `axis` parameter to determine the behavior of the `column_op` function. This should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
