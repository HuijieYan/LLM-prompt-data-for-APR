The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when performing an operation on a DataFrame and a Series where the Series contains timedeltas. The bug causes the resulting DataFrame to contain incorrect values.

The bug is caused by the incorrect construction of the `column_op` function and the subsequent evaluation by the `expressions.evaluate` function.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should be modified to handle the operation correctly between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedeltas. Additionally, the evaluation by `expressions.evaluate` should be adjusted to ensure the correct operation is performed.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `apply` method to apply the specified function `func` to each column of the DataFrame `left` along with the Series `right`. This ensures that the operation is performed correctly, and the resulting DataFrame will contain the expected values.
