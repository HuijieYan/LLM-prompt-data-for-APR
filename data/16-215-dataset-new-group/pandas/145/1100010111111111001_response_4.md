The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to stem from the operation `df * ser` where `df` is a DataFrame and `ser` is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. The `dispatch_to_series` function is trying to handle the multiplication operation without properly accounting for the special case of timedelta operations.

The bug seems to occur in the code block that checks for the type of `right` and sets the `column_op` function accordingly. When `right` is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and `axis` is not specified, it should have a special case for handling timedelta operations instead of just using the generic `func`. This missing handling of the special case for timedelta operations causes the TypeError when trying to perform the operation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the special case of timedelta operations, specifically when the `right` input is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and no `axis` is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and axis is None:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.add(b, axis='columns')
    else:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we added a special case for handling timedelta operations when `right` is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and no `axis` is specified. We use the `add` method of Series for this specific case to handle timedelta operations.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
