The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the `column_op` functions that are defined based on the type of the `right` input parameter. The final expressions are evaluated using these `column_op` functions, and since the column_op functions are using `iloc` to access columns, there is a mismatch in the expected values and actual values of `a` and `b` before the buggy function's return.

The cause of the bug is due to the mismatch in how the `column_op` functions process the input columns based on the type of `right`. This leads to incorrect evaluation of the expressions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` functions to handle the input properly based on the type of `right`.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` functions are modified to directly apply `func` to `a` and `b`, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the type of `right`. This ensures that the expressions are evaluated correctly.
