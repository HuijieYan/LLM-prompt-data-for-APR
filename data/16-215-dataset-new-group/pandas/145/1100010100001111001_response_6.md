The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of the `right` input parameter, particularly when it is a Series. The function tries to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame `left`, perform an operation with the `right` Series, and then return the result as a new DataFrame.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the `right` Series when `axis` is set to "columns". This leads to incorrect data processing and unexpected results.

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the conditional branches related to handling the `right` Series and specifying the axis as "columns" to properly handle the column-wise operations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # handle scalar or 0-dim input
        new_data = left.apply(func, axis=axis, broadcast=False)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        # handle DataFrame input
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        # Apply func column-wise to each pair of columns
        new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right[column.name]), axis="columns")

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        # handle Series input
        # If axis is "columns", perform operation row-by-row
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda row: func(row, right), axis="columns")
        else:
            # Otherwise, perform operation column-wise
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right), axis=axis)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, I've updated the conditional branches to handle different types of input for the `right` parameter, considering the specified axis. This should ensure that the function handles the input correctly and produces the expected results for all cases.
