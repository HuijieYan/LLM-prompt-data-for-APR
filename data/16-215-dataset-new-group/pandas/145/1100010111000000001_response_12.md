The buggy function dispatch_to_series() appears to be improperly handling the multiplication operation involving a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta data type.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional branches that handle different types of right operands (scalar, DataFrame, Series) in relation to the left operand (DataFrame). Specifically, the handling of timedelta data type (ABCDataFrame and ABCSeries) may not be implemented correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta data type, leading to incorrect results or incompatibility issues.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to identify the specific conditional branch that should handle the multiplication operation involving a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta data type, and ensure that the operation is implemented correctly for this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas as pd
    
    right = pd.core.computation.ops.lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if pd.core.computation.ops.lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        return left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, pd.core.dtypes.generic.ABCDataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) and right.columns.equals(left.columns)
        return left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, pd.core.dtypes.generic.ABCSeries):
        if isinstance(right.dtype, pd.TimedeltaDtype):
            return left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = pd.core.computation.expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles the multiplication operation involving a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta data type appropriately, using the apply() method to apply the function element-wise and return the expected DataFrame result.
