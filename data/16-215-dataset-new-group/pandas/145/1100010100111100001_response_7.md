The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

The issue seems to be with how the function is handling the operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values. The function is not correctly handling the presence of NaT values in the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle the operation with NaT values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added conditionals to check for the presence of NaT values in the Series and handle them appropriately when performing the operation.

With these changes, the corrected function should now handle the operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values without raising a TypeError.
