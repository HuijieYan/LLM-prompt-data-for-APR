The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError` when it tries to perform an arithmetic operation on a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64, which contains "NaT" values. The bug seems to be occurring in the `column_op` function when it tries to perform the operation between columns of a DataFrame and the Series.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle timedelta64(NaT) properly. When `column_op` tries to perform the arithmetic operation using `func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])` where `b` is a Series with 'NaT' values, the TypeError is raised since it is not handling this case properly.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the 'NaT' values in the Series while performing the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)  # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules

    masked_arith_op = column_op  # save the original implementation

    # Modify the column_op to handle 'NaT' values
    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: masked_arith_op(a, b.iloc[i]) if not isinstance(b.iloc[i], pd.NaT) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This fix involves implementing a wrapper for `column_op` and handling 'NaT' values during the operation. With this fix, the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should pass the failing test.
