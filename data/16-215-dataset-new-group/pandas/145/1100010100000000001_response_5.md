The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the conditional statements that check the type of the 'right' argument and in the 'column_op' functions defined within each conditional block.

The cause of the bug is in the conditional checks and in the implementation of the 'column_op' functions. There are inconsistencies in the logic and behavior of the conditional checks and the 'column_op' functions, which may lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to refactor the conditional checks and the 'column_op' functions to ensure consistency in behavior and logical flow. This may involve revisiting the conditions and their corresponding implementations, as well as ensuring that the correct operations are applied to the input arguments based on their types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.common as com

    right = com.apply_if_callable(right)

    if com.is_scalar(right):

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b.loc[x.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b[x.name]))

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = left.apply(column_op)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the conditional checks have been revised to handle different types of 'right' arguments consistently, and the 'column_op' functions have been updated to reflect the correct behavior based on the input types. The use of the 'apply' method ensures that the function 'func' is applied correctly to the DataFrame columns and Series values. The code also has improved readability and maintainability.
