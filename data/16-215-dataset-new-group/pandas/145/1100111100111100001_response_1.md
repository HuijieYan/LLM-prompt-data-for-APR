The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of NaN values (represented as NaT in the timedelta dtype) in the Series or DataFrame. The error message indicates that the function is trying to perform an arithmetic operation involving a numpy array and a NaTType, which is not supported.

The bug is likely within the `column_op` function, which is used to perform the column-wise operation of the DataFrame. In particular, the handling of NaN values in the timedelta dtype is causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the NaN values correctly when performing arithmetic operations. We can use the `np.where` function to mask the NaN values and only perform the operation on non-NaN elements of the arrays.

Here is the corrected version of the `column_op` function:

```python
def column_op(a, b):
    mask = pd.notna(a) & pd.notna(b)
    result = np.empty(len(a), dtype=a.dtype)
    with np.errstate(all="ignore"):
        result[mask] = func(a[mask], b[mask])
    return result
```

By using the `pd.notna` function to create a mask for non-NaN values and applying the operation only to non-NaN elements, we can avoid the TypeError caused by the NaN values.

I made the following changes to fix the bug:
1. Used `pd.notna` to create a mask for non-NaN values in the arrays.
2. Applied the operation only to the non-NaN elements using the mask.

With these changes, the `column_op` function should now correctly handle NaN values when performing arithmetic operations.

Now, the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should be:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            mask = pd.notna(a) & pd.notna(b)
            result = np.empty(len(a), dtype=a.dtype)
            with np.errstate(all="ignore"):
                result[mask] = func(a[mask], b)
            return result
    # other cases remain the same
```

By incorporating the corrected `column_op` function, we can ensure that the `dispatch_to_series` function handles NaN values properly when performing arithmetic operations.

This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
