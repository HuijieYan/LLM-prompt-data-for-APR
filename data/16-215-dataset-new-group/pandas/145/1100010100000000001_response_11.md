The potential error in the code is due to the alternate paths taken by the if-elif-else block. The functions `column_op` are defined with different arguments but in the end, they are all passed to `expressions.evaluate` which might not handle different types of `column_op` properly and may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to create a more uniform interface for the `column_op` function so that it can handle different cases consistently. This can be achieved by passing both `a` and `b` to `column_op` and handling the operations inside the function based on the type of `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        b = right
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        b = right
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        b = right.iloc  # Convert Series to DataFrame for consistency
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        b = pd.DataFrame(right)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    def column_op(a, b):
        if isinstance(b, pd.DataFrame):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        elif isinstance(b, (int, float)):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:  # Handle other cases here
            raise NotImplementedError(b)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, b)
    return new_data

```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function handles different types of `b` inside the function and the uniform interface helps in consistent processing of the operation.
