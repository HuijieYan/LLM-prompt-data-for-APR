## Analysis
The `dispatch_to_series` function is responsible for evaluating the frame operation `func(left, right)` column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The problem might be related to how the function handles different types of input for the `right` parameter.

## Identifying potential error locations
The issue might be related to the conditional statements that check the type of the `right` parameter and select the appropriate method for column operation.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `right` parameter when it's a timedelta series (`ABCSeries`) in the `dispatch_to_series` function. The conditional statement that checks for this case might not be appropriately handling the operation when the `right` parameter is a timedelta series.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
We need to review the conditional statements that handle different types of the `right` parameter and ensure that the appropriate method for column operation is selected based on the input type. Additionally, we should ensure that the operation with timedelta series is handled correctly.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc.to_numpy()) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function, I modified the handling of timedelta series when it's the `right` parameter. Specifically, for the case where `right` is a timedelta series and the `axis` is "columns", I made sure to convert the series to a numpy array before performing the operation, ensuring that the operation is handled correctly.
