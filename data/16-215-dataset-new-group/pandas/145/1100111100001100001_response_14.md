The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function appears to be related to how the `func` argument is being used to operate on the DataFrame and the `right` input. It seems that the code is incorrectly constructing a dictionary of the result of applying the function `func` to individual columns of the DataFrame `a` and the `right` input.

The buggy function is trying to apply the function `func` to each element of the DataFrame `a` and the `right` input, in a way that is not consistent with the input types and shapes.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to correctly handle the different cases for `right` (scalar, DataFrame, Series) and apply the function `func` appropriately to the inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In this corrected version:
- For scalar `right`, the `func` is applied to each column of the DataFrame using the `apply` method.
- For DataFrame `right`, the `func` is applied to each column of the DataFrame based on their name.
- For Series `right` when `axis="columns"`, the `func` is applied to each column of the DataFrame using the `apply` method.
- For Series `right` when `axis` is not "columns", the `func` is applied to each column of the DataFrame using the `apply` method.

This corrected version should handle the different cases for the `right` input and apply the function `func` appropriately.
