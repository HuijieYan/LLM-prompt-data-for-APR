The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be designed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by evaluating column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes in a `left` DataFrame, a `right` scalar or DataFrame, the `func` operator, a string representation, and an axis. The bug seems to be causing issues when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called during DataFrame arithmetic.

The potential error locations within the function could be the conditional statements where the type of the `right` input is checked and different `column_op` functions are defined based on the type of `right`. The bug might be causing the incorrect behavior when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame and a timedelta series.

The cause of the bug is that the `dispatch_to_series` function does not seem to handle the case of a DataFrame with a timedelta series correctly. This is evident from the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` where the function is called with a DataFrame and a timedelta series, and it is not producing the expected output.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the conditional statements that handle the different types of the `right` input and ensuring that the appropriate `column_op` function is defined and used for the case of a DataFrame and a timedelta series.

Below is a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in (None, "columns"):
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCSeries, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCDatetimeArray, ABCTimedeltaIndex, ABCTimedeltaArray)):
        assert right.shape[0] == left.shape[0]

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following modifications:
- Combined the conditions for handling ABCSeries and added additional conditions to handle various types of series and index types.
- Checked for the shape of the `right` input to ensure compatibility with the left DataFrame.
- Updated the conditions to handle timedelta series and ensured the correct `column_op` is defined and used for this case.

By making these changes, the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the case of a DataFrame with a timedelta series, addressing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
