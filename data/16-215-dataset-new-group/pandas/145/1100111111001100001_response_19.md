The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely causing the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail. It seems that when the function is called with a DataFrame and a Series of dtype="timedelta64[ns]", it doesn't handle the operation correctly.

The bug appears to be related to how the function is handling the input series `right` of dtype "timedelta64[ns]". The function should be performing the operation correctly, but it seems to be returning incorrect values.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the function properly handles the case where the input `right` is a Series of dtype "timedelta64[ns]". This may involve modifying the `column_op` functions to handle this specific case correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we add a check for `right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]"` and handle it as a separate case, ensuring that the operations are performed correctly for this data type. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
