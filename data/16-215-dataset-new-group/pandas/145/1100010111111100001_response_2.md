The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError when trying to perform the operation `df * ser`. The error message indicates that the operation is unsupported due to the combination of an ndarray and NaTType.

The issue seems to be with the handling of the NaT values in the `dispatch_to_series` function. The function is not properly handling the operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values and perform the operation accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis == "columns" or right.dtype.kind == 'm' and right.dtype == 'm8[ns]'):
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
        return new_data
    else:
        # For all other cases, use the default behavior
        raise NotImplementedError
```

With this corrected function, the operation `df * ser` should now be handled properly without causing a TypeError.
