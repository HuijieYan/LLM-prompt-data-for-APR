The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to stem from the way it handles different types of input for the `right` parameter. This results in unexpected behavior when the function is called with a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 type.

The potential error locations are in the conditional statements where the function checks the type of the `right` input parameter and then defines the `column_op` function accordingly. There could be issues with the conditions and the resulting definitions of `column_op` for different types of `right`.

In the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, the expected result `expected` is a DataFrame created from the Series `ser` and the DataFrame `df` using the multiplication operator. This means that the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 type.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `column_op` function is correctly defined for the case where `right` is a Series of timedelta64 type.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we simplify the handling of the different types of `right` by defining `column_op` function unconditionally. The `column_op` function is defined to handle the case where `right` is a Series of any type, including timedelta64. This change simplifies the code and makes it easier to handle different input types in a consistent manner.
