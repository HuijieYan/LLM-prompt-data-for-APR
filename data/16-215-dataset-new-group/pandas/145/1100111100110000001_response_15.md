The `TypeError` is occurring in the function `dispatch_to_series` when it tries to apply an arithmetic operation. The issue seems to be related to the handling of scalar `right` values and the `NaT` type from the NumPy module.

The error arises from the fact that the function `column_op` does not handle the `NaT` type properly in some cases. The main issue occurs when `right` is a scalar and represents `NaT`, which leads to the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case of scalar `right` values when operating with `NaT` properly. Additionally, we should handle the case when the `right` type is not one of the expected types specified in the function. Lastly, we should ensure that the correct output is generated in all cases, including when `right` is a scalar or a non-matching data type.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if hasattr(b, 'dtype') and np.issubdtype(b.dtype, np.datetime64):
                # Handle scalar NaT
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], pd.NaT) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, when `right` is a scalar and represents `NaT`, it is handled explicitly by checking for the dtype of `b` and comparing with `np.datetime64`. If `right` is a scalar `NaT`, the output is generated accordingly.

This corrected version should address the `TypeError` and handle the `NaT` type properly for the given arithmetic operation.
