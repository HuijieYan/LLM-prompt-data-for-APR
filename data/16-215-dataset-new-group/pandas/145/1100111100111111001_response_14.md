The bug seems to be caused by the `column_op` function being incorrectly defined. The function attempts to apply a binary operation between a DataFrame and a Series, resulting in a TypeError due to an unsupported operand type(s) for the operation.

To fix this bug, the `column_op` function should be modified to handle the different cases appropriately and correctly apply the operation between the DataFrame and the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right))
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `apply` method of the DataFrame is used to apply the `func` to each column of the DataFrame, with the `right` parameter passed as the second argument. This ensures that the operation is correctly applied to the DataFrame, handling both scalar and DataFrame `right` inputs.
