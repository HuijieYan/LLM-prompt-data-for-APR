The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is caused by an error when handling the multiplication operation with a DataFrame and a Series containing "NaT". The error message indicates a "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'".

The issue arises because the function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the "NaT" value correctly when performing the arithmetic operation with a DataFrame. The error occurs specifically when the function encounters a Series with "NaT" values and attempts to perform the operation with the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the function `dispatch_to_series` needs to be updated to handle the special case of "NaT" when it occurs in a Series that is being operated on by a DataFrame.

The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function is provided below.

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle the "NaT" case for Series
            b = b.where(~b.isnull(), np.nan)  # Replaces "NaT" with NaN
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
