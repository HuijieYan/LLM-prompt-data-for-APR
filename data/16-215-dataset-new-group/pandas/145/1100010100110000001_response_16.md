Based on the error message, the bug arises from the fact that the function `dispatch_to_series` does not handle the case where the 'right' operand passed to the function is a NaT (Not a Time) object properly. This results in a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle this NaT case appropriately. We can achieve this by adding an extra condition that explicitly checks for NaT and returns an appropriately handled result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, pd.NaT):
        # Handle the case of right being NaT
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the condition `elif isinstance(right, pd.NaT)`, we can handle the case in which the 'right' operand is a NaT object. In this case, the new `column_op` function returns a dictionary with NaN values for each column index, as this is how Pandas handles operations involving NaN values.

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle operations involving a DataFrame and a NaT object as the 'right' operand. It should pass the failing test that was mentioned earlier.
