The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` is causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform the operation between the DataFrame and the Series. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to multiply the DataFrame `left` by the Series `right`, both of which contain NaT values.

The issue lies in the `column_op` functions being called based on the type of the `right` input. The bug leads to the `NotImplementedError` being raised because the handling of certain cases, such as when `right` is a Series and `axis != "columns"`, is incomplete.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the different cases of `right` needs to be updated in the `dispatch_to_series` function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the operation between the elements of `left` and `right` is properly handled when either of them contains NaT values.

Here's a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    # Helper function to handle operations between DataFrame and Series
    def apply_func_to_columns(a, b, func):
        result = {}
        for i in range(len(a.columns)):
            # Handle NaN and NaT values
            result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i]
        return result

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = apply_func_to_columns(left, right, func)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = apply_func_to_columns(left, right, func)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis is None or axis == "columns"):
        # Handle row-by-row operation
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        result = {}
        for i in range(len(left.columns)):
            result[i] = func(left.iloc[:, i], right)
        new_data = result
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        # Handle other cases
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = apply_func_to_columns(left, right, func)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, left, right)

```

In the fixed version, we use the `apply_func_to_columns` function to handle the operation between the DataFrame and Series, ensuring that NaN and NaT values are properly handled. We also update the logic for handling different cases of `right` in the if-elif-else block.

This corrected version of the function should now handle operations between DataFrames and Series, including when they contain NaN and NaT values.
