The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the way it handles the multiplication operation (`*`) between a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the multiplication of the DataFrame and the Series, resulting in incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case of multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]` properly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle the case of multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. Specifically, you need to add a new condition to check for this specific case and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            # Handle the case of multiplication between DataFrame and Series of timedelta64[ns]
            result = left.copy()
            for i in range(len(left.columns)):
                result.iloc[:, i] = func(left.iloc[:, i], right)
            return result

        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function is now able to correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`, fixing the bug.
