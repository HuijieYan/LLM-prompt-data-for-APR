The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely related to the handling of timedelta data types when performing arithmetic operations on DataFrames. It appears that the function does not correctly handle the multiplication operation when one of the operands is a timedelta variable.

The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the timedelta data type when performing the multiplication operation. The function should be modified to handle timedelta data types appropriately when performing arithmetic operations on DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0: 
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right)) if isinstance(right, (int, float)) else expressions.evaluate( 
            column_op, str_rep, left, right, left._col_op, 'axis', 1, ifilter=is_predicate
        )
    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries, ABCSeries)): 
        new_data = left._combine_frame(right, func)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```
The correction involves using the `left.apply` function to handle scalar operations, and `_combine_frame` method to handle DataFrame and Series operations appropriately. Additionally, I replaced the ternary operator with the lambda function for better readability and performance. This should now correctly handle timedelta data types when performing arithmetic operations on DataFrames.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
