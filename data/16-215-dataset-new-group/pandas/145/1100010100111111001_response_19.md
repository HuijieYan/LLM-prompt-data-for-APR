The bug in the function seems to be due to the handling of the operation on a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values, leading to a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The cause of the bug is that the function `column_op` is not handling the operation properly for DataFrame and Series with NaT values, as it is attempting to broadcast the operation and failing due to the presence of NaT values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `column_op` function to handle the operation with appropriate checks for NaT values.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right.iloc[:, idx]), args=(right.columns,))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right.iloc[idx]), args=(range(len(right)),))
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

This corrected version modifies the function to use the `apply` method to handle the operation properly for DataFrames and Series with NaT values. We apply the operation directly to each column of the DataFrame, or each element of the Series, as appropriate.

By modifying the logic to handle the operation with NaT values properly, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
