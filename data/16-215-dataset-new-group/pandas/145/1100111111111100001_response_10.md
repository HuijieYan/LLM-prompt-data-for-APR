The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError when trying to perform the multiplication operation between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser` in the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`. The error message indicates that the function is attempting to perform an unsupported operand type(s) operation between a numpy array and 'NaTType'.

The issue lies within the `column_op` function, as it is the one being called to perform the operation between the DataFrame and the Series. Specifically, the `column_op` function is not handling the case where the right operand is a scalar or a DataFrame correctly, leading to the incorrect operation.

To fix this bug, the `column_op` function needs to be updated to handle the case where the right operand is a scalar or a DataFrame properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame or Series
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if axis == "columns":
        if not isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame) and not isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            right = pd.DataFrame({i: right for i in left.columns}, index=left.index)

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the right operand is a scalar by creating a DataFrame where each column contains the scalar value, and we handle the case where the right operand is a Series by performing the operation column-wise while ensuring that the indices match.

With this correction, the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should now pass without any TypeErrors.
