## Issue Analysis
The error message indicates a failed DataFrame arithmetic test due to an unsupported operand type ("numpy.ndarray" and "NaTType") for multiplication. The failing test is a timedelta64 operation on a DataFrame calling the `dispatch_to_series` function. The error occurs during the operation evaluation and the subsequent use of the `op` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the presence of unsupported operand types in the DataFrame arithmetic operation. Specifically, there's an unsupported operand type issue for the Mul operation due to the presence of `NaTType`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to be adjusted to handle the case where the right operand contains "NaTType". The adjustment should include checking for the presence of `NaTType` in the right operand and handling the operation accordingly.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if np.any(pd.isna(right)):
        # Handle NaT in the right operand
        new_data = {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
The corrected `dispatch_to_series` function includes a conditional check for the presence of `NaT` in the right operand. If `NaT` is found, it directly processes the operation on the DataFrame without invoking the `expressions.evaluate` function. This allows bypassing the error caused by the presence of `NaT` in the right operand.
