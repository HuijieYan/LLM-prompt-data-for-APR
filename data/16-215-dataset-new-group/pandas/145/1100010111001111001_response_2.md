The bug in the function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be related to the handling of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The expected result is a DataFrame with the same shape as the original DataFrame, containing the original Series values in each column.

The buggy function fails to handle the `timedelta64[ns]` dtype correctly, producing an unexpected result.

To fix the bug, the handling of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype needs to be corrected in the function `dispatch_to_series`.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = pd.concat([func(left[col], right) for col in left.columns], axis=1)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

With this fixed version of the function, the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass, and the expected result should be obtained.
