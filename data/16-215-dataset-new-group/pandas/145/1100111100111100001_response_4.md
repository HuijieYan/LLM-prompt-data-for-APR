The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is taking in a DataFrame `left`, a scalar or DataFrame `right`, a function `func`, and optionally a string `str_rep` and axis `axis`. It then evaluates the frame operation `func(left, right)` by iterating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation.

The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the multiplication operation (`<built-in function mul>`) between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`.

The problematic part of the code is the nested `if-elif-else` structure where different behaviors depending on the type of `right` and the `axis`. The type of `right` is being checked using `isinstance` and `assert` statements, and based on these conditions, different `column_op` functions are defined to handle the operations.

From the error message, it can be seen that the problem arises when the function tries to evaluate the multiplication operation on non-null elements of the input arrays. It is attempting the operation again only on the non-null elements, but running into issues with unsupported operand types (`numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`).

To fix the bug, we should assure that the operations are handled correctly based on the types of the input arrays. This can be achieved by revisiting the logic for different types of `right` and updating the operation handling accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is updated to directly apply the operation `func` on the input arrays based on their types, without iterating column-by-column. This ensures that the operation is handled correctly for different types of input arrays.

This correction should address the issue with unsupported operand types and allow the function to perform the frame operation `func(left, right)` correctly, passing the failing test.
