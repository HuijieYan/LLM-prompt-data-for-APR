The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing the test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail. The problem arises from the incorrect handling of the `timedelta64` data type in the DataFrame arithmetic operation.

The buggy function fails to appropriately handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64` dtype, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to specifically handle the `timedelta64` data type and perform the arithmetic operation correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype.kind == 'm':
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=0)
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right), axis=1)
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case when the `right` input is a Series with a `timedelta64` dtype. We use the `apply` method to perform the arithmetic operation correctly, whether it's column-wise or row-wise, based on the `axis` parameter.

With this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64` dtype correctly. This fix should help pass the failing test.
