The bug seems to be in the way the function handles the input parameters and the calculations within the function. 
The function should handle different types of input parameters such as DataFrames and Series differently but does not currently do so effectively.

I will suggest fixing the bug by updating the `column_op` function to handle different input parameter types more efficiently and to ensure that the calculations are performed correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if axis == "columns":
        if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = {col: func(left[col], right) for col in left.columns}
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported combination of right and axis")
    else:
        if isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
            new_data = {col: func(left[col], right) for col in left.columns}
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported combination of right and axis")

    return expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, left, right)
```

In this corrected version, the code is restructured to handle different types of input parameters based on the value of the `axis` parameter. The loop structure is used to apply the `func` function to each column of the `left` DataFrame and the `right` Series or DataFrame, depending on the type and value of the `axis` parameter. This approach helps ensure that the calculations are performed correctly and efficiently for different combinations of input parameters.
