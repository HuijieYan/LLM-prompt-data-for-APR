The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a TypeError because it is attempting to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of 'timedelta64[ns]' type, resulting in an unsupported operand error. 

The buggy function is trying to perform the operation `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` where `a` is a DataFrame and `b` is a Series of 'timedelta64[ns]' type. This operation is not supported for the 'timedelta64' type, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the special case where the right operand is a Series of 'timedelta64[ns]' type.

Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        # Handling special case where right is a Series of 'timedelta64[ns]' type
        result = left.copy()
        for col in left.columns:
            result[col] = func(left[col], b)
        new_data = result
        return new_data

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we handle the special case where the right operand is a Series of 'timedelta64[ns]' type by directly applying the operation to each column of the DataFrame and the Series.

With this fix, the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass.
