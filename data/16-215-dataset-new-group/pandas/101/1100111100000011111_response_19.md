## Analysis and Bug Explanation

The bug occurs when trying to cast a categorical series back into an integer column, as it converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value. The issue was raised on GitHub with the detailed code sample, problem description, expected output, and the library versions installed.

The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The bug occurs when trying to handle the dtype with NaN values, such as converting from categorical to int, ignoring NaNs. The function should properly handle NaNs when casting to an integer type.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are at the conditional checks for handling categorical NaN values and at the return statement for converting to integer values.


## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of categorical NaN values when casting to an integer type. This will involve refining the conditional checks and return statements to ensure that NaNs are properly handled during the casting process.

## The Corrected Function

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    if isinstance(dtype, (pd.CategoricalDtype, pd.CategoricalDtypeType)):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            if isna(arr).any():
                return pd.array([dtype.na_value], dtype=dtype)
            else:
                return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)
        
        elif pd.api.types.is_float_dtype(dtype):
            return lib.astype_floatsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected function handles the categorical NaN values appropriately when casting to an integer type. It uses the `pd.api.types` functions to check for the dtype and whether it is an integer or a float type. If it is an integer type, it checks for NaN values and returns the appropriate array with NaN handling. If it is a float type, it returns the float-safe casted array without modification. This ensures that the bug raised on GitHub is properly addressed and the function now handles categorical NaN values when casting to an integer type.
