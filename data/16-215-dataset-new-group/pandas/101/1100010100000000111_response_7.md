The issue here lies in the `astype_nansafe` function within the pandas library. The issue describes how converting a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype results in unexpected behavior, where NaN is converted to a large negative integer.

The cause of the bug is in the `astype_nansafe` function's handling of converting categorical series back into integer columns, which leads to NaN being incorrectly converted to a large negative value, instead of being treated as NaN or converted to an appropriate integer type.

To fix this bug, we should update the `astype_nansafe` function to handle the conversion of categorical types containing NaNs more accurately, ensuring that NaN is appropriately handled and converted to the correct integer or float representation.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # (existing code...)

    # Check for categorical dtype
    if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if is_nullable_dtype(arr.dtype) and pd.isna(arr).any():
            return pd.array(arr, dtype=dtype)
        elif pd.isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert DataFrame or Series with NaNs to an integer dtype")

    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    # (existing code...)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for categorical dtype using the `is_categorical_dtype` function. If the array contains NaN and is a categorical dtype, we convert it to the specified dtype using `pd.array(arr, dtype=dtype)`. Additionally, we've added a check for nullable dtype using `is_nullable_dtype` and `pd.isna` to handle NaNs appropriately.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread by ensuring that NaNs in categorical types are handled correctly when converting to integer or other types, preventing the unexpected behavior of converting NaN to large negative integers.
