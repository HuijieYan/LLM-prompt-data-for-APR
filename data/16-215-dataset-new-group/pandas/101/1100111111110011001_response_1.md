The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of NaN values when converting datetimes or timedeltas to integers.

The bug is likely caused by a failure to properly handle the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integers. The error message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer" in the failing test suggests that the function is not handling this conversion correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle NaN values when casting to integer types.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime_data) or np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta_data):
        # Handling conversion of NaT values to integer
        if (not skipna) and isna(arr):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

This corrected version includes a check to handle the conversion of NaT values to integers, if `skipna` is not set to True. This should address the issue raised in the failing test cases.
