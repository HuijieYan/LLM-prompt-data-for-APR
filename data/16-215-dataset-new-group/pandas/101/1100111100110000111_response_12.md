## Analysis
The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is intended to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The function handles data type casting for various scenarios, including handling datetime64, timedelta64, floating point, and object data types. The failing test indicates that the function is failing to handle NaN values when casting to integer types.

The related GitHub issue provides additional context about the bug, stating that when converting a categorical series containing NaN values back into an integer column, the NaN values are incorrectly converted to negative integers. This aligns with the failing test case, where attempting to cast NaN values to `np.int64` using the `astype_nansafe` function fails to raise a `ValueError` as expected.

## Potential Error Locations
The cause of the bug may stem from the conditional checks within the `astype_nansafe` function that handle the conversion of NaN values for different data types. Specifically, the bug might be related to the handling of NaN values when casting to integer types.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug can be attributed to the conditional checks in the `astype_nansafe` function that handle the conversion of NaN values to integer types. When a categorical series containing NaN values is cast to an integer dtype, the function is not properly handling the NaN values, resulting in incorrect integer representations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional checks within the `astype_nansafe` function need to be modified to correctly handle NaN values when casting to integer types. Additionally, the function should be tested with categorical series containing NaN values to ensure that the conversion to integer types behaves as expected.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # other code remains the same...

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.floating) and np.isnan(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, a new conditional check is added to handle the case where the input array has an integer dtype and the target dtype is a floating-point type, and NaN values are present in the array. This check raises a `ValueError` if NaN values are present and prevents them from being incorrectly converted to integers.

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now correctly handle the conversion of NaN values when casting to integer types, addressing the issue reported in the failing test and on GitHub.
