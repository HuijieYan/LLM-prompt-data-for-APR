The buggy function `astype_nansafe` has multiple potential error locations. The one that leads to the failing test is in the line:
```python
if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
    raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
```
This condition is raising a `ValueError` when the input array `arr` contains non-finite values, which is the case when `arr` has a `NaN` value. The failing test specifically checks for this condition and expects an error to be raised.

The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" also indicates the problem with converting NaNs to an incorrect integer negative value when converting a categorical series to an integer column.

To fix the bug, an alternative approach should be used to handle non-finite values such as `NaN` when converting to an integer data type. Instead of raising a `ValueError`, the function should appropriately handle these non-finite values to prevent the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Change the handling of non-finite values to prevent raising a ValueError
    if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
        arr[np.isnan(arr)] = np.nan  # Set NaN values to NaN
        warnings.warn("Non-finite values (NA or inf) in the input array were replaced with NaN.",
                      category=RuntimeWarning)  # Emit a warning instead of raising an error

    if is_object_dtype(arr):

        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

```

In the corrected version, the handling of non-finite values has been modified. Instead of raising a `ValueError`, the function now sets non-finite values (including `NaN`) to `NaN` in the input array and emits a `RuntimeWarning` to notify the user about this replacement.

This change should address the issue with converting NaNs to an incorrect integer negative value when converting categorical data to an integer data type, as reported in the GitHub issue.
