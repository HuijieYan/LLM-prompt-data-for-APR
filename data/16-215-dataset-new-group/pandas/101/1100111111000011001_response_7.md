The bug appears to be in the logic for checking if the `dtype` is a datetime or timedelta type and whether the given value to be cast is NaT ('Not a Time' - a pandas representation of missing datetime/timedelta values). Specifically, the bug seems to be in the case of handling NaT values when casting to an integer type.

The buggy function is currently not handling the case where the input array contains NaT values (e.g., `np.datetime64("NaT")`, `np.timedelta64("NaT")`) and is being cast to an integer, leading to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to add a conditional check to handle the case of NaT values when casting to an integer type. We need to ensure that NaT values are not converted to integer and raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # If the dtype is integer and the array contains NaT values, raise an error
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(arr) and isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

This fix checks if the `dtype` is an integer and the `arr` contains NaT values when it is a datetime or timedelta type. If so, it raises the appropriate ValueError.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
