The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, there seems to be an issue with how it handles the conversion of categorical data.

The GitHub issue points out that when converting categorical series back into an integer column, it converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value. This behavior is unexpected, and the expected output should be that NaN in category converts to NaN in IntX(nullable integer) or float.

Based on the analysis of the issue and the buggy function, it appears that the function does not handle the conversion of categorical data containing NaN values appropriately.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the conditional checks and conversion logic to account for categorical data with NaN values. Specifically, when encountering categorical data with NaN values, the function should return NaN instead of an incorrect integer negative value.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # code for handling extension array dtype
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # additional code for handling categorical dtype
    if dtype.name == "categorical":
        if not skipna:
            return arr
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot cast categorical data containing NaN values when skipna is True")

    # remaining code for handling other data types
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we've added a conditional check to specifically handle the categorical data type. If the dtype is categorical and skipna is False, the function returns the input array `arr` as it is. However, if skipna is True and the categorical data contains NaN values, the function raises a ValueError to indicate that it cannot cast categorical data containing NaN values.

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of categorical data with NaN values, addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
