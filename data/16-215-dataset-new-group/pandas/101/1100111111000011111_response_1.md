To fix the bug in the `astype_nansafe` function, we need to focus on the `is_timedelta64_dtype` and `is_datetime64_dtype` blocks. It appears that there is a missing check for `np.datetime64("NaT")` and `np.timedelta64("NaT")`, which is causing the failure of the test case.

Here's the correction for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (pre-existing code)

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(dtype):
        if dtype in [_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]:
            return arr.view(dtype)

        # handle NaT for timedelta64
        if pd.isna(arr).any():
            return np.array([np.datetime64("NaT")], dtype=dtype)

    # ... (pre-existing code)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

Explanation:
- We have added a condition to check if `is_timedelta64_dtype(arr)` and `is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(dtype)` are both true. This is where the bug is occurring, so we need to handle `np.datetime64("NaT")` and `np.timedelta64("NaT")` separately.
- Inside the added condition, we check if `dtype` is in the list of allowed types for conversion. If it is, we simply return `arr.view(dtype)`.
- If the array `arr` contains NaN values, we handle these by returning an array containing `np.datetime64("NaT")` with the specified data type `dtype`.

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test case provided and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
