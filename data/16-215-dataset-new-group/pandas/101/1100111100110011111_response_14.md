## Correction:

The issue arises from the function rejecting the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integer types. This bug is causing the failing test to throw a ValueError as it attempts to convert NaT to an integer.

To fix the bug, we should add a condition to handle the conversion of NaT values to appropriate integer types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (previous function body)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isnat(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (remaining function body)
```

In the corrected version, the added condition checks if the array `arr` has a datetime64 dtype and the desired dtype is an integer. If both conditions are met, it checks if any NaT values are present in the array. If there are NaT values, it raises a ValueError with the appropriate message.

This correction will allow for the appropriate handling of NaT values when converting them to integer types, resolving the issue and satisfying the failing test case.
