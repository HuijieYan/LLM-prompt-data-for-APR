The cause of the bug is that the `astype_nansafe` function is not handling the case of `NaT` values correctly. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected when attempting to convert `NaT` values to an integer `typ`.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to add a check for `NaT` values at the beginning of the function and raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. This check can be done using the `isnat` function from the `np` library.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    if np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this modification, the `astype_nansafe` function should now correctly handle the case of `NaT` values and raise a `ValueError` as expected.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
