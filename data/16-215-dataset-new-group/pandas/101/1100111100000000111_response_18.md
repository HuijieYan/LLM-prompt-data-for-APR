## Analyzing the buggy function and related information

The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The issue reported on GitHub is related to converting from a categorical type to an integer type, where NaNs are ignored.

The bug is likely to be in the section of the code that deals with casting from a categorical type to an integer type, which may not properly handle NaNs.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the `astype_nansafe` function are likely related to the handling of categorical data and the conversion of NaNs during the casting process.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles the conversion from a categorical type to an integer type, where NaN values are not properly handled and are incorrectly converted to integer values. This is supported by the GitHub issue reporting unexpected negative integer values for NaNs during the conversion.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the conversion from a categorical type to an integer type in a way that properly handles NaN values. This may involve checking for NaN values during the conversion process and ensuring that they are correctly represented in the resulting integer type.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

Below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function that addresses the reported bug:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    elif is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            # Handle NaNs properly during the conversion
            result = arr.astype(dtype).fillna(np.nan)
            return result
        elif is_float_dtype(dtype):
            return arr.astype(dtype)
        elif is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return arr.astype(dtype)
        
        raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a categorical from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    # ... (rest of the original function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected version, I added a specific handling for when the input array is of categorical type, and I ensure proper handling of NaNs during the conversion to an integer dtype. This addresses the reported bug related to incorrect conversion of categorical NaNs to integer values.
