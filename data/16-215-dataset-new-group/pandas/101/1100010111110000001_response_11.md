The cause of the bug is that the astype_nansafe function doesn't correctly handle the conversion of "NaT" values to integer data types. The failing test is specifically checking for the ability of the function to raise a ValueError when attempting to convert "NaT" values to int64. However, the function currently does not raise this error, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to raise a ValueError when the array contains "NaT" values and we are attempting to cast to an integer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to an integer data type.
    """

    # ... (other code remains the same)
    
    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to an integer")
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # ... (other code remains the same)
    
    # The rest of the function remains the same

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if there are "NaT" values in the array and raise a ValueError accordingly. This will allow the function to correctly handle the conversion of "NaT" values to an integer data type.

After making this correction, the function should pass the failing test.
