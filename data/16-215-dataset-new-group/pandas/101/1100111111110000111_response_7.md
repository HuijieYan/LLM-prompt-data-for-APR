The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the conversion of NaN values when casting to an integer dtype, specifically when dealing with datetime/timedelta dtypes. This bug resulted in NaN values being converted to an unexpected integer negative value, leading to a failed test and an issue reported on GitHub.

It seems that the `astype_nansafe` function is not handling NaN values correctly when casting to integer dtypes, leading to unexpected negative values for NaN. This is evident from the failing test function `test_astype_nansafe` and the corresponding error message that indicates the function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `astype_nansafe` function to handle the conversion of NaN values to integer dtypes in a more appropriate manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        return lib.astype_arr_to_int(arr, dtype, copy=copy)

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        return lib.astype_arr_to_int(arr, dtype, copy=copy)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the conversion of datetime/timedelta arrays to integer dtypes, ensuring that the conversion of NaN values is handled correctly. This should resolve the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub.

By making these changes, the `astype_nansafe` function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior when casting NaN values to integer dtypes.
