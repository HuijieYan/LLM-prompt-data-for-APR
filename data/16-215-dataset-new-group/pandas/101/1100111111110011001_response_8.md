The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when casting to the integer type. The failing test is specifically testing the conversion of NaT values to an integer type, and the function is expected to raise a `ValueError` when encountered with NaT values.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types correctly. When the function encounters NaT values, it does not handle them as expected and does not raise a `ValueError` as it should.

To fix this bug, an explicit check for NaT values should be added, and when encountered, the function should raise a `ValueError` as specified in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (same function body as before)

    # New code to handle NaT values
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime_data) and arr.size > 0 and isna(arr.ravel()[0]):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function body, unchanged)

```

With this correction, the function now explicitly checks for NaT values and raises a `ValueError` when they are encountered during casting.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
