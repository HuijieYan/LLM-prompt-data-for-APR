The `astype_nansafe` function is failing for the test case where the `dtype` is `np.int64` and the `arr` contains NaT (`Not a Time`) values.

The cause of the bug is that when `np.int64` is passed as dtype in the presence of NaT values, the function fails to raise a `ValueError`. This indicates that it is able to convert NaT values to integers without any error. This is the opposite of the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to handle this specific case where the `dtype` is `np.int64` and the `arr` contains NaT values. We should explicitly check for NaT values in the array and raise a `ValueError` as it is not possible to convert NaT values to an integer data type.

Below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # Handling the specific case where dtype is np.int64 and arr contains NaT values
    if dtype == np.int64 and np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a new check to handle the specific case where the `dtype` is `np.int64` and the array `arr` contains NaT values. If NaT values are found in the array, we explicitly raise a `ValueError` to indicate that it is not possible to convert NaT values to an integer data type.

After making this change, the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test case without any errors.
