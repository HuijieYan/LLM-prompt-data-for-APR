The root cause of the bug is that the `astype_nansafe` function does not handle `NaT` values correctly when trying to convert them to integers. The error message states "Cannot convert NaT values to integer", which indicates that the function is not performing the conversion as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `astype_nansafe` function to handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integers properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # other code remains unchanged

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isnat(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # other code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check for `NaT` values using `np.isnat` before performing the conversion to integer. This fix addresses the bug by properly handling the conversion of `NaT` values to integers.

With this fix, the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test cases and handle `NaT` values when converting them to integers.
