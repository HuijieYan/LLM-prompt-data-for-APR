The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to safely cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` checks whether the given integer dtype is able to handle missing (NaT) values correctly. However, the test does not raise the expected `ValueError`, indicating that the function's default behavior is to not raise the `ValueError` as expected.

The cause of the bug appears to be that when passing a missing value (NaT) to the `astype_nansafe` function with an integer dtype, it fails to raise a `ValueError` correctly.

To fix this bug, a simple strategy would be to add a conditional check for missing values (NaT) when behavior that should raise `ValueError` is encountered. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (existing code)

    if np.datetime_data(arr.dtype).is_nat:
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.number):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to numeric types")

    # ... (existing code)
```

In the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function, a check is added to determine if the input array contains missing values (`NaT`) and if the given dtype is numeric. If this condition is met, it raises a `ValueError`, thus fixing the bug.
