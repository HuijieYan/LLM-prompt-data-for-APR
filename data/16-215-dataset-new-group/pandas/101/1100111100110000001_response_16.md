The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function occurs when trying to convert NaT values to integer using the `astype` method. The bug causes the function to not correctly raise a `ValueError` in this specific scenario, leading to a failing test.

The cause of the bug is that, when converting NaT values to integer, the function does not check for NaN values correctly, which results in the failure to raise a `ValueError` as expected.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to explicitly check for NaT or NaN values when converting to integers and raise a `ValueError` if such values are present in the array.

Here's a corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT or NaN values to integer.
    """

    # code for extension dtype skipped for brevity

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # rest of the code also remains similar, 
    # but the following block is added to check for NaT or NaN values when converting to integers

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        # check for Nan or NaN values when converting to integers
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT or NaN values to integer")

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By adding the explicit check for NaT or NaN values when converting to integers, the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test and accurately raise a `ValueError` in situations where NaT or NaN values are present in the array.
