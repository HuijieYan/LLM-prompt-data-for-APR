After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies in the `astype_nansafe` function's handling of `NaT` values when casting to integer types. The failing test uses `np.datetime64("NaT")` and `np.timedelta64("NaT")` as inputs, and expects the function to raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". However, the function is not handling these `NaT` values properly when casting to integer types, leading to the failure.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to add a specific condition to handle the case when the input array contains `NaT` values and the target dtype is an integer type. Additionally, this condition should raise a `ValueError` with the specific message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not to skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function body...
```

In the corrected version, a new condition checks if the target dtype is an integer type and if the input array contains `NaT` values using the `isna` function. If both conditions are met, it raises a `ValueError` with the specific message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer".

With this fix, the corrected `astype_nansafe` function should be able to handle `NaT` values properly when casting to integer types, and it should pass the failing test.
