The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is related to the incorrect conversion of NaNs in categorical data to integers. When converting a categorical series containing NaNs to an int dtype, the function converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value. This behavior is unexpected and doesn't align with the user's expectations.

The cause of the bug can be traced to the section of the code that handles the conversion of categorical series. The function incorrectly handles NaNs while converting categorical data to an int dtype, leading to the unexpected behavior observed by the user.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle NaNs when converting categorical data to int dtype. Specifically, it should ensure that NaN values in categorical data are appropriately mapped to NaN in the resulting int dtype.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
  
    # (remaining code remains the same)

    if is_object_dtype(arr):

        if np.issubdtype(dtype.type, np.integer):
            if isna(arr).any():
                return arr.astype('Int64')
            else:
                return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)

        # if we have a datetime/timedelta array of objects
        # then coerce to a proper dtype and recall astype_nansafe
        elif is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(dtype):
            return astype_nansafe(arr.astype('O'), dtype, copy=copy)

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Explicit copy, or required since NumPy can't view from / to object.
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected version of the function, a specific condition is added to handle the case when converting categorical data to int dtype. If the input array contains NaN values, it will be converted to the Int64 dtype, which properly handles NaNs. This ensures that the behavior aligns with the user's expectations.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and prevent the incorrect conversion of NaNs in categorical data to integer negative values.
