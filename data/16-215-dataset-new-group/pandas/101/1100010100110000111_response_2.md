### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `astype_nansafe` function is failing to raise a `ValueError` when attempting to cast `NaT` values to an integer. This aligns with the GitHub issue, which discusses the unexpected conversion of NaN in categorical series to an incorrect integer negative value.

### Potential error locations
1. The `is_datetime64_dtype` and `is_timedelta64_dtype` conditionals might be incorrectly handling the NaT values.
2. The handling of NaN values within the function may not be comprehensive, leading to unexpected conversions.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the function not handling NaN and NaT values appropriately when attempting to cast them to integer types. This results in incorrect or unexpected integer values being returned.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Add specific handling for NaN and NaT values within the function to ensure they are appropriately cast to integer types or NaN values.
2. Update the conditionals that check for datetime and timedelta dtype to handle NaN and NaT values correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # handle NaN and NaT values appropriately for integer conversion
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and is_object_dtype(arr) and isna(arr).any():
        arr = arr.astype(dtype, errors='ignore')
        arr[arr.isna()] = np.nan
        return arr

    # rest of the function remains unchanged as it already handles object dtype and datetime/timedelta conversions
    # ...
```

By adding an additional conditional to handle integer conversion for NaN and NaT values and updating the handling within the function, we can ensure that NaN and NaT values are appropriately converted to integer types or NaN values. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
