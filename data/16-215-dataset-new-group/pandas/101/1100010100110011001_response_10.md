The cause of the bug is that the function `astype_nansafe` is not handling the case where the input array `arr` contains NaT (Not a Time) values and the dtype is an integer type. The function should raise a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer" in this case, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we should add a condition to check if the input array contains NaT values and the dtype is an integer type, and then raise a ValueError in this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # ... (the code for handling extension dtype remains the same)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case where the input array contains NaT values and the dtype is an integer type, and will raise a ValueError with the appropriate error message.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
