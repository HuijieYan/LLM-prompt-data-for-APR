## The buggy function and the related functions 

The buggy function, `astype_nansafe`, is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It handles different data types and has logic to handle special cases such as datetime and timedelta. The related functions used within `astype_nansafe` are `is_extension_array_dtype`, `pandas_dtype`, `is_datetime64_dtype`, `is_timedelta64_dtype`, `is_object_dtype`, `to_datetime`, and `to_timedelta`. 

The failing test case involves the conversion of `NaT` values (Not a Time) to integers, specifically when testing for the datatypes `datetime64` and `timedelta64`. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected, suggesting that the `NaT` values were not handled properly.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Handling of `NaT` values for datetime and timedelta.
2. Logic for converting floating point values to integer.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is related to the mishandling of `NaT` values when converting to integer types, specifically for `datetime64` and `timedelta64`. The logic within the function for handling `NaT` values may not be correctly identifying and processing these special values.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the logic within the function for handling `NaT` values needs to be improved. This could involve adding specific checks and conversions for `NaT` values, especially when casting to integer datatypes. Additionally, the handling of special cases such as datetime and timedelta could be revisited to ensure that all exceptional values, including `NaT`, are handled correctly.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... existing function body ...

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        mask = isna(arr)
        if not mask.all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-NaT values to integer")

    # ... remaining function body ...
```

The corrected version of the function includes specific handling for `NaT` values when converting to integer types. By incorporating a check for `NaT` values specifically when dealing with timedelta and integer datatypes, the function should now correctly raise an error when attempting to convert non-`NaT` values to integers. This resolves the issue identified in the failing test case and should align with the expected behavior.
