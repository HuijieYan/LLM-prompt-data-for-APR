The buggy function `astype_nansafe` has an issue with converting categorical series back into an integer column, where it incorrectly converts NaN values to unexpected negative integers.

Upon analyzing the function and the related GitHub issue, it is evident that the bug lies in the section where it checks for the `is_object_dtype` of the input array `arr`. The function fails to handle the conversion of NaN values to integers correctly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic and explicitly handle the NaN values when converting from a categorical series back into an integer column.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # (previous code...)

    if is_object_dtype(arr):

        # Fix for converting categorical series back to integer
        if dtype == np.int64:
            # Convert NaN to NaN, and other values to int64
            result = arr.codes.astype(np.float64)
            result[arr.isna()] = np.nan
            result = result.astype(dtype)
            return result

        # rest of the code as previously defined...
```

In the corrected version, we added a specific check to handle the conversion of categorical series back to int64, where we explicitly handle the NaN values to ensure they are converted correctly.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures that the conversion from categorical series back to integers handles NaN values appropriately.
