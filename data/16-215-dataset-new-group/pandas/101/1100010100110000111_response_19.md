Based on the error message and the GitHub issues provided, it seems that the bug occurs when attempting to convert NaN values in a categorical series to an integer datatype, which results in an unexpected negative value.

Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The error might be occurring when trying to handle NaN values in a datetime or timedelta conversion.
2. There could be a misinterpretation of NaN values in certain dtype conversions.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `astype_nansafe` seems to have issues handling the NaN values when converting certain data types, leading to the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issues.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that NaN values are properly handled when converting to integer datatypes.
2. Check for potential misinterpretations of NaN values during conversions and address them.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same, only the following block of code is updated)

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and not np.issubdtype(dtype, np.floating):
        if isna(arr).any():
            return arr.astype(np.float64).astype(dtype)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the conversion for NaN values when converting to an integer datatype, ensuring that they are properly treated as NaN in the result.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
