There are various factors that could be causing a bug in the given function:

1. Possible causes of the bug:
   a. If `astype_nansafe` is being used as a method on a pandas DataFrame, it could be calling a different method with the same name rather than the function provided in the question.
   b. The function might be returning an unexpected output due to certain conditions not being handled correctly.
   c. The conditional statements in the function might be leading to incorrect paths being followed.

2. Strategy to fix the bug:
   a. Use debugging tools such as print statements or a debugger to understand the flow of the function and identify which conditions are not providing the expected results.
   b. Ensure that the correct `astype_nansafe` function is being called, especially if this function is part of a class and there are other methods with the same name.
   c. Review the conditional branches to make sure they correctly handle all possible input cases.

3. Corrected version of the function:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import lib, tslib
from .common import (
    is_extension_array_dtype,
    is_datetime64_dtype,
    is_timedelta64_dtype,
    _INT64_DTYPE,
    _TD_DTYPE,
    is_object_dtype,
    pandas_dtype,
    isna
)
from pandas import to_timedelta
from pandas import to_datetime

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna : bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if is_object_dtype(dtype):
        mask = isna(arr)
        if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
            return arr.astype(dtype)
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
            return arr.astype(dtype)
        elif dtype.name in ["datetime64", "timedelta64"]:
            msg = (f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
                   f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead.")
            raise ValueError(msg)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```
In this corrected version:
- Import statements have been modified based on the available imports.
- The redundant and unnecessary parts have been removed.
- The conditional statements have been simplified.
- The conditions specific to object dtype and the conversion to datetime and timedelta have been streamlined.
- The type checking and exception raising logic has been standardized.
