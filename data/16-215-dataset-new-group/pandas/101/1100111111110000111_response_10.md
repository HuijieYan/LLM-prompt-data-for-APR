A potential error in the buggy function is within the `astype_nansafe` function where the conditional statement `elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer)` causes the error. 

The bug occurs because the buggy function is unable to handle the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer. The failing test specifically checks if the function can convert NaT values to an integer, and it fails to do so, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement mentioned above should be adjusted to handle the conversion of NaT values to an integer. Additionally, the conditional statements for datetime and timedelta conversions should be revised to handle NaN values appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # existing code
    
    # add a conditional statement to handle NaT values
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # existing code

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With these adjustments, the corrected function should be able to handle the conversion of NaT values to an integer. This fix should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
