The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is failing the test `test_astype_nansafe` because it does not handle the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integer properly. The error message indicates that the function is failing to raise a ValueError when it should.

The cause of this bug is that the function does not properly handle the case where the input array contains NaT values that need to be converted to a specific integer type.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check for NaT values in the input array and raise a ValueError accordingly. We can add this check right at the beginning of the function, before performing any other dtype-specific checks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # check for NaT values and raise an error
    if np.isnan(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
}
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case of converting NaT values to integer, and the test `test_astype_nansafe` should pass successfully, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
