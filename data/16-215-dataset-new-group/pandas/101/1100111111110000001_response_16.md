### Troubleshooting and debugging

The failing test checks the behavior of the `astype_nansafe` function when presented with a `NaT` value (representing 'not a time') of type `np.datetime64` or `np.timedelta64`. The test asserts that a `ValueError` should be raised in response to these specific inputs. However, the function is failing to raise the expected exception.

The code inside the `astype_nansafe` function contains a section that specifically handles the case when the datatype of `arr` is either `datetime64` or `timedelta64`. In both cases, it needs to check whether `dtype` has a valid unit ('ns' in this case) and raise a `ValueError` if not.

### Cause of the bug

In the `astype_nansafe` function, the condition to handle `datetime64` and `timedelta64` datatypes does not account for the possibility of a non-existent or missing unit. When presented with a `NaT` value, the function does not raise the `ValueError` as expected due to incorrectly handling the absence of a unit.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of datetime and timedelta types in the `astype_nansafe` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function checks for the absence of a valid unit and raises a `ValueError` when necessary.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.

    TypeError
        When specific type-related conversions are not possible.
    """

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        # Check for the presence of the 'ns' unit or raise a ValueError
        if "[" not in dtype.name or "]" not in dtype.name:
            msg = (
                f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
                f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead."
            )
            raise ValueError(msg)

    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

By adding the conditional check for the presence of the 'ns' unit for `datetime64` and `timedelta64` types and raising a `ValueError` with the appropriate message when the unit is missing, we address the bug. With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should be able to handle `NaT` values correctly and raise a `ValueError`, allowing the test to pass.
