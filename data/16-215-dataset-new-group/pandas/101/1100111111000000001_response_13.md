The `astype_nansafe` function is failing when trying to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to integer. The failing test demonstrates that the bug occurs when trying to convert a NaT value to an integer using the `astype_nansafe` function.

The bug is caused by the fact that when encountering NaT values and attempting to convert them to an integer using the `astype` function, it throws an error instead of properly handling the conversion.

Possible strategy for fixing the bug:
The correction of this bug involves handling NaT values when converting to an integer. We can modify the section of the code that handles the conversion of datetime or timedelta NaT values to handle this scenario properly by adding a condition that checks for NaT values and appropriately handles the conversion.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... existing code ...

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        # Check for NaN or NaT values
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT or NaN values to integer")
        elif not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # ... remaining code ...
```

By adding the check for `isna(arr).any()`, we can ensure that NaT or NaN values are appropriately handled when converting to an integer, preventing the ValueError from being raised.
