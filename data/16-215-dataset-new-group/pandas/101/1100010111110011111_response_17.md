The buggy function `astype_nansafe` has an issue where it fails to handle `NaT` values correctly when converting them to integers. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` expects the function to raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert `NaT` values to an integer, but the function does not raise the error as expected.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of `NaT` values when converting them to integers. The failing test provides an input of `NaT` with an integer type, expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, but the function does not raise the error, leading to test failure.

To fix this bug, the `astype_nansafe` function needs to properly handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integers when the input type is an integer. Additionally, the function should ensure that the error message matches the expectation in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values (NaN) to integer.
    """
    
    # Existing code...

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values (NaN) to integer")
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # Existing code...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected version, the `elif` statement for converting from floating point to integer checks if there are any `NaN` values in the array, and if so, raises a `ValueError` highlighting that `NaT` values (i.e., `NaN`) cannot be converted to integers. This change ensures that the function handles the conversion from `NaN` to integers correctly.

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now pass the failing test and handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integers as expected, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
