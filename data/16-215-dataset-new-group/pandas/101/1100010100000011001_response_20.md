The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could cause the function to behave incorrectly. One notable area is the check for the dtype of the input array. The function also attempts to handle different data types and conversions, which may lead to incorrect output.

One specific issue is with the check for `is_datetime64_dtype(arr)` and `is_timedelta64_dtype(arr)`, where the conditional checks may not be working as expected because the actual dtype of the input array is not being used.

Based on the provided expected input/output variable values, it seems that the function is expected to correctly handle dtype conversions and return the correct dtype based on the input dtype and array. The function should also check for the presence of NaN values and handle them appropriately during the casting process.

To fix the bug, it may be necessary to revisit the conditional logic within the function to ensure that the correct dtype conversions are being performed based on the input array's dtype and the specified target dtype.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import is_datetime64_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if dtype not in [_INT64_DTYPE, _NS_DTYPE]:
            if is_object_dtype(dtype):
                return tslib.ints_to_pydatetime(arr.view(np.int64))
            elif dtype.kind == "M":
                return arr.astype(dtype)

            raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a datetimelike from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if dtype not in [_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]:
            if is_object_dtype(dtype):
                return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))
            elif dtype.kind == "m":
                result = arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)
                result[isna(arr)] = np.nan
                return result
            elif dtype == _TD_DTYPE:
                return arr.astype(_TD_DTYPE, copy=copy)

            raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a timedelta from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected function, the conditional logic for handling datetime and timedelta dtype conversions has been updated to better match the expected behavior. This should ensure that the function correctly handles the dtype conversions and returns the expected output based on the input dtype and array.
