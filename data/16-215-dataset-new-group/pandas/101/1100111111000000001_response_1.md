The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is supposed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` attempts to cast an array containing `NaT` (Not a Time) values to an integer dtype and expects a `ValueError` to be raised with a specific error message. However, the buggy function does not handle this case properly and results in a failure of the test.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The code block that checks for `NaT` values and raises a `ValueError` is not handling the specific case for `NaT` values properly, resulting in a failure of the test.
2. The failed test specifically deals with `NaT` values, which needs special handling in the function.

The specific cause of the bug is that the buggy function does not have explicit handling for `NaT` values when casting to an integer dtype, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the following strategy is suggested:
1. Detect and handle `NaT` values explicitly for the case where the target dtype is an integer.
2. Add conditional logic to check for `NaT` values and raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # (Previous code remains unchanged...)
  
    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):

        if not np.isfinite(arr).all() and not isna(arr).all():  # Check for both NA and NaN
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # (Remaining code remains unchanged...)
```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle `NaT` values properly when casting to an integer dtype and pass the failing test.
