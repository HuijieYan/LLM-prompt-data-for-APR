Based on the GitHub issue and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect behavior when casting categorical series back into an integer. The issue specifically mentions that NaN values in a categorical series are incorrectly converted to an unexpected negative integer value.

The bug is likely occurring in the `astype_nansafe` function, where the incorrect casting of NaN values is occurring when converting a categorical series back into an integer type. The bug might be related to the handling of NaN values during the casting process, which leads to unexpected negative integer values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the function when dealing with NaN values in categorical series, ensuring that NaN values are correctly handled and converted to NaN in the output.

Here's a corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # existing code logic

    # add specific handling for categorical dtype
    if pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if pd.isna(pd.Series(arr)).any():
            if is_unsigned_integer_dtype(dtype):
                return arr.astype("Int64")  # use nullable integer type
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
    
    # remaining existing code logic
```

In the corrected version, we added specific handling for categorical dtype, checking if the input array is a categorical type and if it contains NaN values. If NaN values are present, we handle the casting accordingly to ensure that NaN values are correctly represented in the output, specifically by using the nullable integer type if the target dtype is an unsigned integer.

This correction should resolve the bug related to the incorrect casting of NaN values from categorical series to integer types.
