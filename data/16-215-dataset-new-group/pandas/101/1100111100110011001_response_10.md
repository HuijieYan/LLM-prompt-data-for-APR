The cause of the bug is that the `astype_nansafe` function is not properly handling the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values for datetime and timedelta to integer types. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the input array contains NaT values for datetime or timedelta types, and then raise a `ValueError` as expected in the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # ... (existing code)

    # if array has datetime or timedelta type and dtype is integer
    if (is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr)) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # ... (existing code)
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the conversion of NaT values and the failing test cases are expected to pass.
