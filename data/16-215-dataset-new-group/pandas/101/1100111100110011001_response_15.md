The cause of the bug is that the function `astype_nansafe` does not handle the conversion of NaT values to integers correctly, which leads to the ValueError not being raised as expected in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check for NaT values and raise a ValueError accordingly. This can be done by checking for NaT values in the array before performing any other conversions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (unchanged code)

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if notna(arr).any() and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (unchanged code)
```

This change ensures that the function explicitly checks for NaT values in datetime or timedelta arrays before performing any conversion to integers, and raises a ValueError if such a conversion is attempted.

With this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
