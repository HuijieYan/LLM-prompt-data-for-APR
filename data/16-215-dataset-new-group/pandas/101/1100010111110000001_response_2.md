The cause of the bug is that when the `astype_nansafe` function is called with a `dtype` of `np.int64` and an array containing `NaT` values, it does not raise a ValueError as expected.

The issue comes from the logic in the `astype_nansafe` function when dealing with datetime and timedelta conversions. In particular, the problem occurs when the `dtype` is `np.int64` and the array contains `NaT` values, as seen in the failing test.

A strategy to fix the bug is to modify the logic in the `astype_nansafe` function related to datetime and timedelta datatype checks. Specifically, when `dtype` is `np.int64` and the array contains `NaT` values, a ValueError should be raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

In this corrected version, I have added a check to see if the `dtype` is a subtype of `np.integer` and if there are `NaT` values in the array. If both conditions are true, a ValueError is raised.

With this correction, the failing test that checks for this specific case is expected to pass, and the error message should not appear.
