The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of NaN values when casting datetime or timedelta values to integers. The failing test case demonstrates that when attempting to cast 'NaT' values (representing missing or null values) to an integer, the function does not correctly raise a ValueError as expected.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect handling of NaT values for datetime and timedelta dtypes.
2. Incorrect error handling when trying to convert NaT values to integers.

Cause of the bug:
The failing test case demonstrates that when attempting to cast 'NaT' (representing missing or null values) to an integer, the function does not correctly raise a ValueError as expected. This indicates that the function is not appropriately handling these missing values when performing the cast.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle the conversion of 'NaT' values when casting datetime or timedelta values to integers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the input `arr` contains 'NaT' values using `np.isnat()` before performing the cast. If 'NaT' values are present, the function correctly raises a ValueError.

This correction ensures that the function appropriately handles missing values when performing the cast, as demonstrated by the failing test case.

Additionally, the corrected code includes an explicit return statement to cast `arr` to the specified `dtype` using `arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)` after the error handling for 'NaT' values.

These changes should resolve the issue and ensure that the function operates as expected when handling missing or null values during the cast operation.
