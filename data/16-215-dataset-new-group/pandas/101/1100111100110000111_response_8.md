The issue here is that the `astype_nansafe` function is not handling NaN values correctly when casting to an integer. The failing test suggests that the function is not raising a `ValueError` when it encounters a NaN value during the casting process. This aligns with the GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs", which describes the unexpected conversion of NaN to a large negative integer value.

The bug seems to be located in the block of code that handles the conversion of NaN values while casting to an integer. The function should be modified to properly handle the conversion of NaN to a safe representation in the target integer type.

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function should be updated to handle NaN values when casting to an integer. It should check for the presence of NaN values and raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message when such values are encountered during the casting process.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (existing code)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not (np.isfinite(arr) | isna(arr)).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # ... (existing code)
```

In this corrected version, we added `isna(arr)` to the conditional statement to check for NaN values. If NaN values are found alongside non-finite values (such as NA or inf), the function will raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.

With this modification, the `astype_nansafe` function should now correctly handle NaN values when casting to an integer, and it should pass the failing test.
