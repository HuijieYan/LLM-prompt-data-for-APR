## Analysis
The error messages indicate that the function `astype_nansafe` is not handling the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integers correctly. This is resulting in unexpected behavior when converting categorical values to integers. The GitHub issue also provides additional context about how this bug is affecting the behavior of the function and the corresponding mismatch between expected and actual output.

## Bug Location
The most likely bug locations in the `astype_nansafe` function are in the conditional branches that handle the special cases for datetime and timedelta dtype. These conditional branches are likely not handling the conversion of NaT values to integers correctly.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the conversion of NaT values to integers, especially in the cases of datetime and timedelta dtypes. This is leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistent output.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the conditional branches that handle the conversion of datetime and timedelta dtypes. Specifically, these conditional branches need to be modified to handle NaT values properly when converting to integers.

## Fixing the Bug
The corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function is as follows:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype) or np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            return tslibs.ints_to_pydatetime(arr.view(np.int64))

        # allow frequency conversions
        if dtype.kind == "M":
            return arr.astype(dtype)

        raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a datetimelike from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype) or np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))

        if dtype not in [_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]:
            # allow frequency conversions
            # we return a float here!
            if dtype.kind == "m":
                mask = isna(arr)
                result = arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)
                result[mask] = np.nan
                return result
        elif dtype == _TD_DTYPE:
            return arr.astype(_TD_DTYPE, copy=copy)

        raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a timedelta from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected version, the conditional branches for datetime and timedelta dtype have been modified to properly handle the conversion of NaT values to integers. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test and behaves as expected.
