The issue with the given code is that it is not handling the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values to integer values correctly, resulting in a ValueError not being raised as expected in the test.

The bug is caused by the conditional statement checking whether the input array `arr` has a datetime64 dtype or a timedelta64 dtype. The bug originates from the fact that the conditional check does not properly handle the scenario where the input array has a NaT value and needs to be converted to a specific integer dtype.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement that checks for datetime64 and timedelta64 dtype in the input array. We should also handle the case where the input array contains a NaT value and needs to be converted to an integer dtype.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslib.ints_to_pydatetime(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            if isna(arr).any():  # Check for NaT values
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
            return arr.view(dtype)
        # ... (other code remains the same)

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            if isna(arr).any():  # Check for NaT values
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
            return arr.view(dtype)
        # ... (other code remains the same)

    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

In this corrected version:
- We added a check for NaT values using `isna(arr).any()` before converting to an integer dtype.
- If NaT values are found, we raise a ValueError with an appropriate message.
- The rest of the code remains unchanged.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types correctly.
