The bug in the function `astype_nansafe` is causing NaN values in categorical data to be incorrectly converted to an integer value, which is unexpected behavior. The issue has been raised on GitHub, where it has been mentioned that converting categorical series back into an integer column converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value, which is not the expected output. This issue needs to be addressed by fixing the function to handle NaN values in categorical data properly.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are where it handles `Categorical` data and the conversion of NaN values to integer types.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle NaN values properly when converting categorical data to integer types. This results in NaN values being converted to incorrect integer values, which does not align with the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle NaN values in categorical data separately and ensure that they are converted to NaN properly when converting to integer types.

To address this issue, the corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if is_object_dtype(arr):

        if np.issubdtype(dtype.type, np.integer):
            if isna(arr).any():
                return arr.astype('Int64').values
            return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)

        # if we have a datetime/timedelta array of objects
        # then coerce to a proper dtype and recall astype_nansafe
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(dtype) or is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
            if isna(arr).any():
                return arr.astype('float64').values
            return arr.astype(dtype)

    if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        msg = (
            f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
            f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Explicit copy, or required since NumPy can't view from / to object.
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the input array contains NaN values and correctly convert them to NaN when the data is being converted to integer or float types. This modification ensures that the function behaves according to the expected output and resolves the GitHub issue related to converting categorical data to integers.
