The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the conversion of categorical data containing NaNs to an integer dtype. The issue on GitHub reports that when converting a categorical series back into an integer column, the NaN values are being converted to unexpected large negative values, rather than staying as NaN or being converted to an appropriate integer or float representation.

The potential cause of this bug could be related to how the function handles the conversion of NaN values within categorical data to an integer dtype. It seems that the function is not effectively handling these NaN values during the conversion process.

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve adding explicit handling for NaN values within categorical data during the conversion to integer dtype. Additionally, ensuring that the dtype conversions are performed correctly for categorical data containing NaNs. It may also involve modifying the logic surrounding the handling of NaN values during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other implementation remains the same)

    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # New handling for categorical data with NaNs
    elif is_categorical_dtype(arr) and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        if skipna:
            arr = arr.fillna(-1)  # Fill NaN with a placeholder value, assuming -1 as NaN
            result = arr.astype(dtype)  # Convert to target integer dtype
            result[result == -1] = np.nan  # Replace the placeholder value with NaN
            return result
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)  # Convert as usual without handling NaNs

    # ... (other conditional blocks remain the same)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected version, additional handling has been added specifically for categorical data (`is_categorical_dtype`) when the target dtype is an integer (`is_integer_dtype`). The function first fills NaN values with a placeholder value, then performs the dtype conversion, and finally replaces the placeholder value with NaN in the resulting array.

This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that converting categorical data containing NaNs to an integer dtype produces the expected output.
