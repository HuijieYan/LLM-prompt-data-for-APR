To fix the bug, the issue should be addressed within the `astype_nansafe` function. Specifically, the bug occurs when trying to cast a categorical column with NaN values to an integer dtype. The `astype_nansafe` function should handle this case by converting NaN values in categorical columns to NaN in the output integer dtype.

To address the bug, we can update the `astype_nansafe` function to handle the case where the input dtype is an integer and the input array has NaN values. We would call `arr.view(dtype)` on the non-NA values and then convert the NaN values to NaN in the output integer dtype.

Here's the fixed version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # remaining code from the original function

    # if dtype is integer and arr has NaN values
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and is_object_dtype(arr) and isna(arr).any():
        result = arr.view(dtype)
        result[isna(arr)] = np.nan
        return result

    # remaining code from the original function

```

With this fix in place, the `astype_nansafe` function should handle the case of converting categorical columns with NaN values to an integer dtype correctly. This modified version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
