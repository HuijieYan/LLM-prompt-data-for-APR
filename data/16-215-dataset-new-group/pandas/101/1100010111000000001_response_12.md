Bug analysis:
The `astype_nansafe` function fails a test that attempts to convert a NaT value to an integer. The function appears to handle various types, including datetime and timedelta, and it seems that it may not be handling the NaT value correctly for integer conversion.

Potential error locations:
The code handling the case for NaT values, specifically for datetime and timedelta, may not be handling them correctly for integer conversion.

Cause of the bug:
The failing test indicates that the function is unable to convert NaT values to integer, leading to a `ValueError`. This suggests that the handling of NaT values for integer conversion is incorrect in the function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the conversion of NaT values to integers. This might involve checking for NaT values and applying the appropriate conversion or raising a relevant error message.

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

        if np.isnan(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

The above suggested fix involves adding a check for `np.isnan(arr).any()` after the `np.issubdtype` condition. This checks for any NaN (including NaT) values and raises a `ValueError` if found, preventing the incorrect conversion of NaT values to integers.

This fix should address the failing test case by properly handling the conversion of NaT values to integers.

After making this fix, running the failing test case with the corrected `astype_nansafe` function should pass without raising a `ValueError`.
