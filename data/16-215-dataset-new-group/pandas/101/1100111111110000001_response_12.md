The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when an array containing `NaT` (Not a Time) values is cast to an integer type.

The failing test calls the `astype_nansafe` function with the `arr` parameter set to an array containing a `NaT` value and with the `dtype` parameter set to `np.int64`. The expected behavior is that the function should raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". However, the function does not raise the expected `ValueError` and hence the test fails with the error "Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>".

The cause of the bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it incorrectly handles the case where an array contains `NaT`. It should raise a `ValueError` for this case, but it does not. Hence, the strategy for fixing the bug would be to add a conditional check to specifically handle the case when the array contains `NaT` values, and raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function that passes the failing test:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and to_datetime(arr).isnull().any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now correctly handle the case when an array contains `NaT` values and raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.
