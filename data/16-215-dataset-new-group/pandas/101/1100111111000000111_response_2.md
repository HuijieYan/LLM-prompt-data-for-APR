To fix the bug, we need to address the issue with casting categorical `NaN` values to integer and return `NaN` instead of a negative integer value.

The problem with the current implementation is that it does not handle categorical `NaN` values correctly and converts them to incorrect negative integer values.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # (existing function body here...)

    if is_categorical(arr):  # Check if the array is of type categorical
        return arr.astype(dtype)  # Simply cast the array to the specified dtype

    # (existing function body here...)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this corrected version, when an array of categorical type is encountered, the function simply casts it to the specified dtype without additional processing, which will ensure `NaN` values are preserved as `NaN` in the result.

By explicitly handling categorical arrays and ensuring that `NaN` values are handled correctly, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
