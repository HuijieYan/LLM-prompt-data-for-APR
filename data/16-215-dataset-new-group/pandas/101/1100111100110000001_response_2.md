The specific bug in the given function is occurring when the `astype_nansafe` function is called for the datatype of `np.datetime64("NaT")` and `np.timedelta64("NaT")` with `np.int64` as the expected type. The error message suggests that the function is not properly handling the conversion of "NaT" values to integer for the given datatypes.

Currently, the function does not handle NaT (Not a Time) values as expected, leading to the error. The bug happens because there is a missing conversion case for `NaT` values to the integer type.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the case for `NaT` values within the `astype_nansafe` function. The code needs to be modified to explicitly handle "NaT" values for the conversion to integer types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if arr.ndim == 0 and arr.size == 1 and (np.isnat(arr[()])):
            arr = arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
            return arr
        else:
            mask = isna(arr)
            result = arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)
            result[mask] = np.nan
            return result
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

By checking for the `NaT` values in datetime and timedelta arrays, the corrected function ensures that the conversion to integer types handles these values properly.

After making these changes, running the failing tests with the corrected function should pass without raising any errors.
