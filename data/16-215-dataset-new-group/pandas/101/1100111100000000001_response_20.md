The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is intended to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. The function `lib.astype_str` is called, but its implementation is not provided and the module it is located within is not imported. This could result in an ImportError and lead to a failure of the function.

2. The `astype_nansafe` function seems to have an overrepresentation of error raise conditions which doesn't match the intended functionality. 

Below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if skipna and is_object_dtype(dtype) and is_float_dtype(arr):
        arr = arr.astype(fill_value)
    else:
        if skipna and is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
            from pandas import to_datetime
            return to_datetime(arr)
        elif skipna and is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
            from pandas import to_timedelta
            return to_timedelta(arr)
        elif not skipna and is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
            from pandas import to_datetime
            return to_datetime(arr)
        elif not skipna and is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
            from pandas import to_timedelta
            return to_timedelta(arr)

    return arr

```

This corrected version simplifies the error conditions and removes the unnecessarily complex branching and unnecessary exceptions.
