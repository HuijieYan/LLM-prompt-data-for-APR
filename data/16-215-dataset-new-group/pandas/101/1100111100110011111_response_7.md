The buggy function is `astype_nansafe`, which is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The failing test indicates that the function is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when trying to convert `NaT` values to integers.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the block that handles `NaT` values and the block that handles the conversion of datetime or timedelta arrays of objects.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the conversion of `NaT` values to integer types when using `astype_nansafe`. This results in `NaT` values being converted to unexpected negative integer values, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to properly handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integer types and ensure that the function raises a `ValueError` when encountering `NaT` values during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas import to_datetime, to_timedelta

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for `NaT` values when both the source and target dtypes are integers, and raise a `ValueError` if `NaT` values are encountered during the conversion.

This fix will ensure that the function properly handles the conversion of `NaT` values to integer types and raises a `ValueError` as expected, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
