### Analyzing the Buggy Function and the Related GitHub Issue

1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It deals with data type conversions and handles special cases such as datetime, timedelta, object, and others.
2. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` demonstrates that the function is unable to handle the conversion of NaN values to integer types, leading to a `ValueError`.
3. The related GitHub issue highlights a scenario where converting categorical series back into an integer column results in NaN being converted to an unexpected negative value.
4. The issue also points out that attempting to use `astype('Int8')` results in a "dtype not understood" error.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The handling of NaN values during data type conversion is a potential error location. It seems that the function is not correctly handling NaN values in specific data type conversions, especially when converting from categorical to integer types.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling NaN values when converting categorical series back into integer columns, resulting in unexpected negative values. This leads to failing tests and unexpected behavior when attempting to use certain data type conversions.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `astype_nansafe` needs to be updated to handle NaN values correctly during data type conversions, especially when converting from categorical to integer types. Proper handling of NaN values in specific data type conversions is crucial for the function to pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if dtype.name in ["UInt8", "Int8", "UInt16", "Int16", "UInt32", "Int32", "UInt64", "Int64"]:
        if np.isnan(arr).any():
            return pd.Series(np.where(np.isnan(arr), np.nan, arr).astype(dtype))
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # ... (other cases remain unchanged)
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the conversion from categorical to integer types, ensuring that NaN values are correctly handled without leading to unexpected negative values. This should address the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
