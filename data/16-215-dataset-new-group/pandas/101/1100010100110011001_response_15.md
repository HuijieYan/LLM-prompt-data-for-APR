## The bug
The bug occurs when the function `astype_nansafe` is called with a `dtype` of `np.int64`. The function raises a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". This is happening because the function expects to raise this error when the input array contains non-finite values (like NaN or NaT) and is being cast to an integer type. However, the error is not being raised as expected, causing the test to fail.

## The fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly raises a `ValueError` when the input array contains non-finite values (NaN or NaT) and is being cast to an integer type. This can be done by adding a check for non-finite values and explicitly raising a `ValueError` if such values are present.

## The corrected version

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # (previous implementation...)

    # check for non-finite values when casting to an integer type
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # (previous implementation...)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly raise a `ValueError` when attempting to cast an array containing non-finite values to an integer type. This should resolve the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
