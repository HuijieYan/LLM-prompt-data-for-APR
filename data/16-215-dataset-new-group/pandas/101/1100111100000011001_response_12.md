The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where `dtype` is `np.int64` correctly in all branches of the code. More specifically, it fails to handle the case where `dtype` is `np.int64` for both datetime and timedelta types.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that when `dtype` is `np.int64`, the function returns `arr.view(dtype)` as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    elif is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslib.ints_to_pydatetime(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            return arr.view(dtype)
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            return arr.view(dtype)
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the function now correctly handles the case where `dtype` is `np.int64` for both datetime and timedelta types, and it returns `arr.view(dtype)` as expected. This will satisfy the expected input/output values for the given cases.
