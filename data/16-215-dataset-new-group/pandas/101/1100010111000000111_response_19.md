The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is causing an error when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. This is evident in the failing test `test_astype_nansafe`, where the function raises a ValueError when trying to convert NaT values to an integer.

The bug is specifically related to the conversion of NaN values to specific integer types. The failing test shows that when attempting to convert NaN values of the `category` datatype to an integer, it converts NaNs to incorrect integer negative values. This behavior is unexpected and contradicts the expected output, which would be NaN in the integer datatype or float.

To fix the bug, a strategy would involve modifying the logic within the `astype_nansafe` function to correctly handle the conversion of NaN values and ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Handling the conversion from categorical to int
    if arr.dtype.name == "category" and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        
    # Handling the case where the dtype is a datetime or timedelta
    if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        msg = (
            f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
            f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)
        
    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Explicit copy, or required since NumPy can't view from / to object.
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected version, an additional check has been added to specifically handle the conversion from the `category` datatype to an integer datatype. This ensures that NaNs are correctly handled during the conversion process, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to the bug.
