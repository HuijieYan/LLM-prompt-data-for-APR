I will first identify potential error locations in the provided buggy function and then explain the cause of the bug before suggesting a strategy for fixing the issue. Finally, I will provide a corrected version of the function to resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The function uses `np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating)` to check if the input array `arr` has floating data type. However, the buggy function incorrectly uses `np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating)` in the condition block intended for integer type check which might lead to inappropriate processing.
2. In the condition block for `is_object_dtype(arr)`, the function uses incorrect casting method to `np.integer`. This incorrect casting method might lead to processing errors for datetime/timedelta arrays of objects.

### Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, the `astype_nansafe` function has potential error locations that result in the failing test. 

In the failing test, the function is called with `arr` containing either `NaT` for `datetime64` dtype or `timedelta64` dtype. The bug causes the data type to be incorrectly cast to `np.int64` in the `astype_nansafe` function, leading to inappropriate conversion of `NaN` values to integer and resulting in the `ValueError` that is raised during the test.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to address the potential error locations in the `astype_nansafe` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct condition blocks are used for type checks, and appropriate conversion methods are used for object to integer casting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... existing code ...

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
    # Correct condition block for floating type check

    elif is_object_dtype(arr):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):  # Correct condition block for integer type conversion
            return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)

        # Further checks for datetime/timedelta arrays of objects
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
            from pandas import to_datetime
            return astype_nansafe(to_datetime(arr).values, dtype, copy=copy)
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
            from pandas import to_timedelta
            return astype_nansafe(to_timedelta(arr).values, dtype, copy=copy)
    # ... existing code ...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the casting of NaN values to integer and resolve the failing test case.

The corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function addresses the potential error locations identified and should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue describing the bug.
