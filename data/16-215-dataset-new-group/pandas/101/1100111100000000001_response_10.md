The potential bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that the code does not handle the NaN values correctly when casting as a float.

The bug is caused by the following block of code:
```python
if dtype not in [_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]:
    if dtype.kind == "m":
        mask = isna(arr)
        result = arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)
        result[mask] = np.nan
        return result
    elif dtype == _TD_DTYPE:
        return arr.astype(_TD_DTYPE, copy=copy)
    raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a timedelta from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")
```
In the above code, the condition `dtype not in [_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]` implies that if the `dtype` is not an integer or timedelta, then it goes on to handle the case when `dtype` has a kind of "m". However, within that condition, if NaNs exist in the array `arr`, then those NaNs are not properly handled when converting the array to the specified `dtype`.

To fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of NaNs within the array and handle them appropriately before converting the array to the specified `dtype`.

Given below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function that addresses this bug:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    if dtype == np.float and is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
        mask = isna(arr)
        result = arr.astype(dtype)
        result[mask] = np.nan
        return result

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

The updated version of the `astype_nansafe` function checks for the presence of NaNs in the array when converting to `dtype` of kind "m" (minutes) and handles them appropriately before the conversion.
