The bug seems to be related to the `astype_nansafe` function not handling the conversion of NaT values to integer correctly. The failing test shows that the function is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when trying to convert NaT values to integer.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the section handling the conversion of NaT values to integer is not properly checking and raising the ValueError in all relevant cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly checks for and raises a `ValueError` when trying to convert NaT values to integer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # rest of the function remains the same

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):

        if not np.isfinite(arr).all() and not isna(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT or non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding `not isna(arr).all()` to the condition, we ensure that the function also checks for NaT values and any non-finite values (NA or inf), and raises a `ValueError` in those cases.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and handle the conversion of NaT values to integer as expected.
