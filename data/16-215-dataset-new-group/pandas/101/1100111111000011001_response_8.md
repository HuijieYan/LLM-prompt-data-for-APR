The issue with the `astype_nansafe` function is that it fails to handle `NaT` (Not a Time) values in certain scenarios, specifically when converting to integer types. 

The failing test case `test_astype_nansafe` provides the input of `NaT` with dtype `int64` and expects the function to raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer".

The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The function does not handle the case of input `NaT` when converting to an integer dtype.
2. There are some conditional statements that may not correctly handle all cases.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific condition to handle the input `NaT` when converting to an integer dtype and ensure that all conditionals are correctly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By adding the condition `if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):`, we explicitly check for the presence of `NaT` values when converting to an integer dtype, and if found, raise a `ValueError` as expected in the failing test case. All other existing checks and conditionals remain unchanged.

The corrected function now properly handles the `NaT` values, and it should pass the failing test case.
