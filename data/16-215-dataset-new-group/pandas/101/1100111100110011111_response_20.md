The bug appears to be related to the conversion of NaN values within categorical data to integers. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is failing to handle NaN values correctly when converting from categorical to integer dtype. The failing test suggests that the function is not raising a `ValueError` when it should, as it cannot convert NaN values to integer.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the handling of datetime and timedelta dtype, as well as the handling of object dtype and view/copy conditions.

The bug appears to be caused by the mishandling of NaN values within categorical data when converting to integer dtype. This leads to an unexpected negative integer value instead of NaN. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior, causing the failing test not to raise the expected `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles NaN values when converting from categorical to integer dtype. This may involve modifying the conditional logic in the function to explicitly handle NaN values and raise an appropriate error or handle them appropriately during the conversion process.

A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(dtype, pd.CategoricalDtype):
        if pd.NA in arr:
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

        return arr.astype(dtype)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

In the modified version, we explicitly handle the case where `dtype` is of type `pd.CategoricalDtype` and check if `pd.NA` is present in the `arr`. If it is, we raise a `ValueError` as it is not possible to convert NaN values to an integer.

By adding this specific handling for categorical data, we ensure that the function correctly handles NaN values during the conversion process and raises the appropriate error when necessary. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the provided failing test cases.
