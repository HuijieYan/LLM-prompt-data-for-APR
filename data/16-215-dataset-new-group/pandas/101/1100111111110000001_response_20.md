The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it is not correctly handling the types of `NP.NaT` (Not a Time) values when casting to an integer. This causes the test to fail, expecting a `ValueError` to be raised when converting `NaT` values to integer.

The cause of the bug is that `astype_nansafe` function is not correctly handling the case where the input array contains NP.NaT values and is being cast to an integer `np.int64`. The function raises a `ValueError` when it encounters NP.NaT values, which is expected behavior.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a conditional check in the function to handle the case where the input array contains NP.NaT values and it is being cast to an integer `np.int64`. In this case, the function should raise a `ValueError` as shown in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Raise ValueError when converting NP.NaT values to integer.

    """

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if np.any(pd.isna(arr)):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

With this fix, the `astype_nansafe` function will correctly handle the case when the input array contains NP.NaT values and is being cast to an integer `np.int64`, and the provided failing test will pass.
