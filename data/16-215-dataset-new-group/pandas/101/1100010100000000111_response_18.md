The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is an internal function in the pandas library, used to safely cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The GitHub issue titled "Converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs" indicates that when converting a categorical series back into an integer column, it converts NaN to an unexpected large negative value, which is not the desired behavior.

The potential error locations in the buggy function include the code sections that handle the conversion of categorical series to int, specifically the handling of NaN values.

The cause of the bug is that the `astype_nansafe` function does not correctly handle the conversion of NaN values when casting a categorical series to int, resulting in an unexpected large negative value instead of NaN.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the function to correctly handle the conversion of NaN values when casting a categorical series to int. This likely involves modifying the section of code that handles the conversion of categorical series to integer dtype to ensure that NaN values are correctly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    elif is_object_dtype(arr):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)
        
        # handle conversion of categorical series to int
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            result = arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
            result[arr.isna()] = pd.NA
            return result

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a conditional check to handle the conversion of categorical series to int. When the dtype is np.int64, we cast the array to the specified dtype, and then replace NaN values with `pd.NA` to ensure that NaN values are preserved during the conversion.

By making this change, the function will no longer convert NaN to an unexpected large negative value when casting a categorical series to int, resolving the bug raised in the GitHub issue.
