The bug in the function `astype_nansafe` is caused by the incorrect conversion of NaN values in categorical data to an incorrect integer value when converting to an integer dtype. This bug is causing the unexpected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue, where NaN is converted to a large negative number. 

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that when converting from a categorical data type to an integer data type, the NaN values are properly handled and converted to a missing value indicator (e.g., NaN or None) in the integer data type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a NaN-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (imports and other parts of the function remain the same)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, pd.CategoricalDtype):
        if (is_integer(dtype) or is_unsigned_integer_dtype(dtype)) and isna(arr).any():
            # Convert NaN to None for integer data types
            return arr.astype("Int64")
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to handle the case where the input array `arr` has a data type of `pd.CategoricalDtype`. If the input array has a categorical data type and the destination data type is an integer or unsigned integer type, we convert NaN values to `None` by using the `astype("Int64")` method to ensure proper handling of missing values in the integer data type.

With this correction, the bug should be resolved, and NaN values in categorical data will be properly handled when converting to an integer data type.
