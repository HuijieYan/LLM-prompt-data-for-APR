The cause of the bug is that when converting a categorical series back into an integer column, it was converting NaN to an incorrect integer negative value instead of NaN as expected.

The bug is likely located in the logic that handles the conversion of categorical series to integer columns, as well as the handling of NaN values during the conversion.

To fix the bug, the function `astype_nansafe` should be updated to correctly handle the conversion of categorical series to integer columns and ensure that NaN values are appropriately handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... existing code ...

    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # Handle conversion of categorical series to integer columns
    if is_categorical(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
    
    # Handle conversion of NaN values in categorical series
    if is_categorical(arr) and isna(arr).any():
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return arr.astype('object').where(notna(arr), np.nan).astype(dtype)
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)
    
    # ... existing code ...

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if the input array is a categorical series and if the requested dtype is an integer. If both conditions are met, it directly applies the `astype` operation to the categorical series to convert it to the requested integer type. Additionally, it also handles the conversion of NaN values in the categorical series to NaN in the output integer column.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that NaN values in categorical series are correctly handled when converting to an integer column.
