The buggy function `astype_nansafe` has multiple conditions for different data types and conversions. The failing test is specifically checking for the behavior when converting NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer.

The potential error location is within the condition `np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer)`, where the function checks if the input array has a floating dtype and the desired output dtype is an integer. The condition for checking non-finite values seems to be the cause of the bug.

The bug occurs because the condition to check for non-finite values (`np.isfinite(arr).all()`) does not account for the presence of NaT values, which are considered non-finite. This causes the ValueError to be raised incorrectly when converting NaT values to an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to allow NaT values to be handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (existing code)

    # previous conditions

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):

        # Fixing the condition to account for NaT values
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all() and not np.any(isna(arr)):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (inf) to integer")

    # ... (existing code)
```

With this modification, the corrected function should handle NaT values appropriately, and the failing test should pass.
