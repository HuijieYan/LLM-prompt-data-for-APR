The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is not handling the case when a NaT (Not a Time) value is cast to an integer. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is expected to raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer", but it doesn't.

The cause of this bug is that when `astype_nansafe` is called with a `datetime64` or `timedelta64` value that is NaT, it does not raise the `ValueError` as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the part of the function where it handles `datetime64` and `timedelta64`. We should add a condition to raise the `ValueError` when an NaT value is being cast to an integer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# this is the corrected buggy function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (the code before handling datetime64 and timedelta64)

    # (previous code for handling dtype and other types ...)

    # handle datetime64 and timedelta64 with NaT value
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
        # other datetime64 handling code ...
        # ...
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
        # other timedelta64 handling code ...
        # ...

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the `astype_nansafe` function will correctly raise a `ValueError` when attempting to cast a NaT value to an integer.

The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
