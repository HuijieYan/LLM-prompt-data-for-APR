The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the dtype is a datetime64 or timedelta64 dtype without a unit. This results in a ValueError being raised without handling this case properly.

Potential error location:
```python
if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
    msg = (
        f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
        f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead."
    )
    raise ValueError(msg)
```

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the dtype is a datetime64 or timedelta64 dtype without a unit. It raises a ValueError instead of providing a mechanism to handle this scenario.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the code to handle the case where the dtype is a datetime64 or timedelta64 dtype without a unit. We can do this by checking if the dtype name matches "datetime64" or "timedelta64" and then appending "[ns]" to the dtype name before using it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        if dtype.name == "datetime64":
            dtype = np.dtype('datetime64[ns]')
        elif dtype.name == "timedelta64":
            dtype = np.dtype('timedelta64[ns]')

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

By adding the check for "datetime64" or "timedelta64" and appending "[ns]" to the dtype name if it matches, we resolve the bug and make the function capable of handling the datetime64 or timedelta64 dtype without a unit.
