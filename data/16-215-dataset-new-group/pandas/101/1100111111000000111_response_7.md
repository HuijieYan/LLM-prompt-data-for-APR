### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, the GitHub issue

The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It is called by a failing test named `test_astype_nansafe` in the `pandas/tests/dtypes/test_common.py` file. The test fails when attempting to cast a value of `NaT` (Not a Time) to an integer dtype. This issue has also been reported on GitHub with the title "BUG: Don't cast categorical nan to int". 
The reported issue explains that converting categorical series back into an int column results in incorrect negative values for NaN. It is expected that NaN in category should be converted to NaN in IntX(nullable integer) or float.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations within the `astype_nansafe` function may be related to the handling of NaN values when casting to integer or float data types.

### Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information

The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` fails when trying to convert `NaT` values to an integer dtype. The reported GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where converting categorical series containing NaN values to an integer dtype results in unexpected negative values for NaN.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function needs to be modified to ensure that NaN values are handled correctly when casting to integer or float data types. This may involve checking for NaN values and treating them appropriately during the casting process.

### Provided corrected version of the buggy function

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function based on the analysis and the reported issue:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... existing code ...

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

        # handling NaN values
        mask = np.isnan(arr)
        arr[mask] = np.nan  # convert NaN values to NaN (no change)
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # ... remaining code ...
```

In the corrected version, when attempting to convert floating point types to an integer type, it checks for non-finite values and handles NaN values appropriately to prevent unexpected results. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_astype_nansafe` pass.
