The `astype_nansafe` function is supposed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a NaN-safe manner. However, given the failing test and the corresponding error message, it is failing for both `val = numpy.datetime64('NaT')` and `val = numpy.timedelta64('NaT')` when the target type is `numpy.int64`. The failing test is expecting an error message indicating that conversion of NaT values to integer is not possible, but the function is not raising the expected ValueError.

After analyzing the code, the bug arises from the condition block `is_datetime64_dtype(arr)` and the subsequent condition `is_object_dtype(dtype)`. In this block, if the dtype is an object, it recursively calls `astype_nansafe` passing the values returned by `to_datetime(arr).values` and the dtype. This recursive call does not handle the NaT value conversion to integer which leads to the bug.

To fix this issue, we should add a specific check for NaT values in the function and raise a `ValueError` accordingly. Below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    if arr.size and is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if np.isnat(arr):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains as is
```

In the corrected version, we specifically check if the input array is of datetime64 dtype and if the target dtype is an integer. If both conditions are met and the array contains a NaT value, a `ValueError` is raised accordingly.

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer.
