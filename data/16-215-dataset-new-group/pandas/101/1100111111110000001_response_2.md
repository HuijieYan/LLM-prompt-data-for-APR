The `astype_nansafe` function is throwing an error because it's unable to handle the input `NaT` values for the specified data type (`np.int64`). This error originates in the part of the function that specifically processes `NaT` values.

The current implementation of the `astype_nansafe` function does not correctly handle the conversion of NaT values to the `np.int64` data type. The error occurs because the function does not explicitly handle the case where the input `val` is `NaT` and the `dtype` is `np.int64`. 

To fix this bug, a conditional statement must be added to handle this specific case. Here, the correct output for the NaN values is to raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that conversion of `NaT` values to integer is not possible.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... [previous code unchanged]

    if np.isnat(arr):
        if dtype != np.object:
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... [rest of the function, unchanged]
``` 

With this correction, when the input `val` is `NaT` and the `dtype` is `np.int64`, the function will raise a `ValueError` with the required message.
