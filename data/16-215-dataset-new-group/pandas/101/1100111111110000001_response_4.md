In the buggy function `astype_nansafe`, the cause of the bug is that the check for non-finite values in the case of float to integer conversion isn't taking into account values that represent missing data (such as `NaT`). This causes the ValueError to not be raised in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we handle the missing data appropriately during float to integer conversion. We can use the `np.isnan()` and `np.isinf()` functions to check for NaN and infinite values, and then raise a `ValueError` if any are found.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype or type
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """
    # remaining code stays the same

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all() and not np.isnan(arr).all() and not np.isinf(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # remaining code stays the same
```

With this modification, the corrected version of `astype_nansafe` should now pass the failing test cases.
