The buggy function `astype_nansafe` does not handle the conversion of NaT values to integer correctly. This bug is triggered when `astype_nansafe` is called with an array containing a `NaT` (not a time) value and a target dtype of `np.int64`. The failing test indicates that the function is expected to raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer" but it does not.

The cause of the bug lies in the block of code that attempts to handle the case when `np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating)` and `np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer)` are both True. This condition checks if the source array `arr` has floating point dtype, and the target dtype `dtype` is an integer. However, it fails to properly account for the special case of NaT values when attempting the conversion.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for NaT values in the specified condition and raise a `ValueError` with the required message.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a NaN-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # existing code...

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all() or np.isnan(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    
    # existing code...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In this corrected version, the condition `np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer)` is enhanced to also include a check for `np.isnan(arr).any()`. If any `NaN` values (which includes `NaT` in datetime) are present in the source array `arr`, a `ValueError` is raised with the appropriate message.

This fix ensures that the behavior of `astype_nansafe` is consistent with the requirements of the failing test.
