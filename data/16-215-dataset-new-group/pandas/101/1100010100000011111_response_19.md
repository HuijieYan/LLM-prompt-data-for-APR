Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the incorrect conversion of categorical data with NaN values to integer dtype. The expected behavior is for NaN values in the categorical column to be preserved as NaN in the integer representation.

The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of NaN values when converting categorical data to an integer dtype. The current implementation converts NaN to a large negative integer, which is unexpected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `astype_nansafe` function to handle the conversion from categorical to integer dtype correctly, preserving NaN values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if dtype.name == "Int64":
        if isna(arr).any():  # If there are NaN values
            if copy:  # Make a copy if copy is True
                return arr.astype(dtype)
            else:  # Otherwise, convert to the nullable integer dtype directly
                return arr.view(dtype)
        else:  # If there are no NaN values, regular integer conversion
            return arr.astype(dtype)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the conversion to the nullable integer dtype (dtype.name == "Int64"). If there are NaN values in the array, we check if copying is requested and then either make a copy with the nullable integer dtype or convert directly to the nullable integer dtype. If there are no NaN values, we perform a regular integer conversion.

This fix will ensure that when converting categorical data with NaN values to an integer dtype, the NaN values are preserved as NaN in the integer representation, as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
