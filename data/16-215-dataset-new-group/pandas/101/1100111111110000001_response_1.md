The failing test is calling the function `astype_nansafe` with a `datetime64` and a `int64` argument. The error message specifies that the function is failing to raise a `ValueError`. This suggests that the function `astype_nansafe` is not handling the conversion of `datetime64` to `int64` correctly, and it's not producing the expected error message.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling `datetime64` to `int64` conversion in the `astype_nansafe` function is incorrect. The function is not raising the `ValueError` as expected, and this is causing the test to fail. The logic for handling the conversion of `datetime64` to `int64` needs to be revised.

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function logic for handling the conversion of `datetime64` to `int64` needs to be updated. When the input array (`arr`) contains a `NaT` value and the dtype is `int64`, the function should explicitly raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message explaining that conversion of `NaT` values to `int64` is not supported.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # existing code ...

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and dtype == np.int64:
        if pd.isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # existing code ...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In the corrected version, I've added a conditional block to handle the specific case of converting from `datetime64` to `int64`. If the input `arr` contains any `NaT` values and the `dtype` is `int64`, it will raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
