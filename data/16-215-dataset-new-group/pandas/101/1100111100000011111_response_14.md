## Analysis and Bug Explanation
The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function occurs when trying to convert NaN values from a categorical series to an integer type. When converting categorical series back to an integer column, the function converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value (`-9223372036854775808`), which is unexpected. This leads to an error when attempting to cast a categorical series containing NaNs to an integer dtype.

### Error Locations
The buggy function contains several branches that handle different dtype conversions with a variety of conditions. However, it seems that the conversion from a categorical series containing NaNs to an integer type is not handled correctly. This is likely the cause of the issue reported in the GitHub report.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of converting NaN values from a categorical series to an integer type. This leads to incorrect integer negative values being generated instead of NaNs, which is unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the conversion of NaN values from categorical series to integer types. This may involve adding a specific case to handle NaN values and ensure that they are correctly handled during the conversion process. Additionally, the function should ensure that the output type is compatible with the input categorical series and NaN values are not misinterpreted.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function is provided below:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.
        
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    
    # ... (existing code)

    if is_object_dtype(arr):
        
        # work around NumPy brokenness, #1987
        if np.issubdtype(dtype.type, np.integer):
            if pd.isna(arr).any():
                return ensure_int64(arr, copy=copy)  # Convert NaNs to integer
            return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)
        
        # if we have a datetime/timedelta array of objects
        # then coerce to a proper dtype and recall astype_nansafe
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
            from pandas import to_datetime
            return astype_nansafe(to_datetime(arr).values, dtype, copy=copy)
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
            from pandas import to_timedelta
            return astype_nansafe(to_timedelta(arr).values, dtype, copy=copy)
            
    # ... (existing code)
```

In the corrected version, a specific case for handling NaN values when converting categorical series to integer types is added. The `ensure_int64` function is used to handle the conversion of NaN values to integer, ensuring that NaNs are not misinterpreted during the conversion process. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub report and ensure that NaN values in categorical series are correctly handled during the conversion to integer types.
