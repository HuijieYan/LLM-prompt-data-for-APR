The bug seems to be related to the astype_nansafe function in the cast.py file of the pandas library. The specific error message indicates that the function is failing to raise a ValueError when attempting to convert NaT values to an integer.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the conversion of NaT (Not a Time) values in the input array when attempting to cast to a different data type. The provided GitHub issues indicate examples of converting from categorical to integer dtype and how it results in unexpected behavior and incorrect integer values for NaN.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle NaN (Not a Number) and NaT values appropriately when performing type conversion. The fix should account for these special values and ensure that their conversion to integers raises the ValueError as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer
    """

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    # Check if the dtype is integer
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version of the function adds additional handling to check for the presence of NaN or NaT values when converting to an integer data type. If such values are found and the dtype is an integer, the function will raise a ValueError as expected.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle NaN and NaT values during type conversion and pass the failing test cases, resolving the issues described in the GitHub reports.
