The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it does not properly handle the case when the input array (`arr`) contains missing values represented as "NaT" for datetime/timedelta types, and the desired output type is integer (`np.int64`). The buggy function does not detect and handle this situation, leading to a ValueError when trying to cast the "NaT" values to integer.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific check for "NaT" values and handle them accordingly when the desired output type is integer. 

Here's a corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # existing code...

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) and (is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr)) and dtype == np.int64 and isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # existing code...

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)
```

In this corrected version, we have added a specific check to see if the input array `arr` has missing values ("NaT") and the desired output type is integer (`np.int64`). If both conditions are true, the function raises a ValueError explicitly stating that "NaT" values cannot be converted to integer.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
