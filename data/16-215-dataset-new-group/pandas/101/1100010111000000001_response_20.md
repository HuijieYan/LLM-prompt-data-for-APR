Upon analysis, the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be encountering errors causing the failing test. The issue seems to be with the conversion of NaT values to integers.

Looking at the failing test, we can see that it is trying to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to integers, which is raising a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". This is due to the handling of NaT values within the `astype_nansafe` function.

The strategy for fixing this bug is to handle the NaT values before attempting to cast them to integers.

Below is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function to pass the failing test:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # Handle NaT values
    if arr.dtype == np.dtype('datetime64[ns]') and np.isnat(arr):
        arr = np.datetime64('nat')
    elif arr.dtype == np.dtype('timedelta64[ns]') and np.isnat(arr):
        arr = np.timedelta64('nat')

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```

In the corrected version, we added code to explicitly handle NaT values for datetime and timedelta arrays before casting to the desired dtype. This should allow the function to pass the failing test.
