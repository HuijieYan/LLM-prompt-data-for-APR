The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is failing because it does not handle the case when the input array `arr` contains NaT (Not a Time) values for datetime/timedelta, and the `dtype` to which it is being cast is of type `np.int64`. This is resulting in a `ValueError` because it should not convert NaT values to integer.

The incorrect behavior is causing the failing test `test_astype_nansafe` to raise an assertion error indicating that the function did not raise the expected `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we need to account for the special case when the `arr` contains NaT values and the `dtype` is `np.int64`. The fix involves checking if there are NaT values in the array, and if so, raising a `ValueError` to indicate that conversion to an integer is not allowed for these values.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    # (existing code...)
    # Previous code as written
    if np.issubdtype(np.dtype, np.integer) and is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(arr):
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

With this correction, the `astype_nansafe` function accounts for the presence of NaT values in the input array and correctly raises a `ValueError` when trying to convert it to an integer.

This corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test `test_astype_nansafe` and not raise a `ValueError` as before.

The corrected function ensures that the cast to a specific type will raise a `ValueError` if the array contains NaT values, preventing the conversion of these special values to integers.
