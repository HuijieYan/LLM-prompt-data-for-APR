From the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect conversion of categorical series back into integer columns, resulting in NaN being converted to an incorrect integer negative value. This bug has been identified in the GitHub issue, and the expected behavior should be that NaN in a category converts to NaN in an IntX (nullable integer) or float.

To fix the bug, the astype_nansafe function needs to be modified to handle the conversion of categorical series back to integer columns correctly.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to add a conditional check at the beginning of the astype_nansafe function to handle the conversion of categorical series back into integer columns appropriately. This check should identify if the input array is a categorical dtype and the desired output dtype is an integer.

Here's a corrected version of the astype_nansafe function that addresses the issue:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    
    if isinstance(arr, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            arr = arr.astype('Int64')
            return arr
    # rest of the function body remains the same
```

In this corrected version, the conditional check at the beginning of the function identifies if the input array is a categorical dtype and the desired output dtype is an integer. If this condition is met, the categorical series is cast to 'Int64', which is a nullable integer type, and then returned.

This modification should address the issue described in the GitHub bug and ensure that the conversion of categorical series back into integer columns handles NaN values correctly.
