The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is caused by the incorrect handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when converting to integer. The function should raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert NaT values to integer, but it fails to do so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling NaT values when converting to integer. Specifically, when converting NaT values to integer, the function should raise a `ValueError` to indicate that it is not possible.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # remaining code is the same as the original function

    # ... 

    # add the block to handle NaT values when converting to integer
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and arr.ndim > 0 and np.isnan(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles the case of converting NaT values to integer and raises a `ValueError` when necessary, which aligns with the expected behavior.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
