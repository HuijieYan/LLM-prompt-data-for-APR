The bug appears to be related to the conversion of NaT (Not a Time/TimeDelta) values to integer. The failing test is attempting to convert an array that contains the NaT value to an integer using the `astype_nansafe` function. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the implementation of the function does not handle the conversion of NaT values to integer correctly. When the input array contains NaT values and the target dtype is an integer, the implementation does not raise an appropriate error.

To fix the bug, the implementation should check for the presence of NaT values and raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to an integer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (code for extension dtype, dtype check, and other conditions)

    # handle NaT values
    if np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    if dtype.kind in ["m", "M"]:
        # handle frequency conversions for datetime and timedelta
        return arr.astype(dtype)
    else:
        return arr.view(dtype)
```

By explicitly checking for NaT values in the input array and raising a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to an integer, the corrected version of the function ensures that the conversion is handled correctly.

This should fix the bug and make the corrected function pass the failing test cases.
