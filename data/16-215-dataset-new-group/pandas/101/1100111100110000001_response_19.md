The given buggy function `astype_nansafe` in the pandas library is causing failing tests related to converting NaT values to an integer.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the function does not handle the special `NaT` (Not-a-Time) values gracefully. It seems to be raising a ValueError exception but is not consistent in doing so.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Handle `NaT` values explicitly in the function.
2. Ensure that it raises the `ValueError` as expected in both cases when `val` is `np.datetime64("NaT")` and `np.timedelta64("NaT")`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    # Remaining code ignored for brevity
    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    # Remaining code ignored for brevity
```
After adding this code snippet to handle `NaT` values correctly, the failing tests should pass and the bug will be fixed.
