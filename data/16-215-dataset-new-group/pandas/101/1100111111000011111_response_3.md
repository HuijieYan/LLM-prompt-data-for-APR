## Analysis
The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is intended to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, the failing test demonstrates that the function fails to handle NaN values properly when casting to an integer type.

The issue posted on GitHub also highlights a related problem where converting a categorical series back into an integer column results in NaN being incorrectly converted to an integer value, which is unexpected behavior.

The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution demonstrate what the correct behavior should be and help in identifying the cause of the bug.

## Identification of Potential Error Locations
- The function appears to handle the logic for dtype conversion for different types such as strings, datetime64, timedelta64, floating, and objects.
- There is a specific check to convert a datetime64 or timedelta64 array of objects to the proper dtype and recall `astype_nansafe`, but this logic does not seem to address the NaN handling for integer conversions.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of NaN values when converting to an integer dtype. It seems that the function does not handle NaN values properly when casting to an integer type, resulting in unexpected behavior and failing tests.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `astype_nansafe` function to correctly handle NaN values when casting to an integer type. This may involve adding specific checks and handling for NaN values when the target dtype is an integer.

## Corrected Version
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    elif is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if skipna and isna(arr).any():
            return lib.astype_object(arr.ravel()).reshape(arr.shape)
        return arr.view(dtype)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, a specific check is added for datetime64 or timedelta64 arrays when casting to an integer dtype. If the skipna parameter is True and NaN values are present in the array, we convert the array to an object dtype to avoid the unexpected behavior when casting to an integer type.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that NaN values are handled correctly when casting to an integer dtype, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
