The buggy function `astype_nansafe` fails when trying to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to integer, as seen in the failing test. The function doesn't handle this case properly, resulting in a ValueError.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the parts where it tries to convert NaT values to integers.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the conversion of NaT values to integers properly. It raises a ValueError instead of treating NaT values as missing or invalid values.

To fix the bug, we can add a specific check for NaT values and handle them by either treating them as missing values or returning NaN when converting to a float.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime_data) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if isna(arr):
            if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.floating):
                return arr.astype(dtype)  # Treat NaT as NaN when converting to float
            else:
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")  # Raise an error for integer conversion

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the conversion of NaT values, treating them as missing values or returning NaN when converting to a float, and the failing test should pass.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
