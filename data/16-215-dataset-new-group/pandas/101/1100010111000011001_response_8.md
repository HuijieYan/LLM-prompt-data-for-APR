The bug in the function astype_nansafe is that it does not handle the "NaT" (Not a Time) values correctly when converting them to integer using the np.int64 data type. This results in a ValueError being raised with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". The bug appears to be located in the block where the function checks for is_datetime64_dtype and is_timedelta64_dtype.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to add a specific check for "NaT" values when converting to integer and handle them appropriately, rather than raising a ValueError.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and pd.isna(arr).any():
        arr = arr.copy()
        arr[pd.isna(arr)] = 0  # Replace NaT values with 0 before conversion

    # ... (remaining code as it is)
```

By adding this check and handling "NaT" values appropriately, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
