The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is causing it to fail when attempting to convert `NaT` (Not a Time) values to integer types. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when the input array contains `NaT` values and the target dtype is an integer type. The function attempts to perform the conversion without checking for the presence of `NaT` values, resulting in the failure.

To fix the bug, the function needs to include a check for `NaT` values when converting to integer types, and raise a `ValueError` if they are encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # Check for NaT values when converting to integer types
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (remaining parts of the function remain unchanged)
```

The added check ensures that when the input array contains `NaT` values and the target dtype is an integer type, a `ValueError` is raised as expected.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
