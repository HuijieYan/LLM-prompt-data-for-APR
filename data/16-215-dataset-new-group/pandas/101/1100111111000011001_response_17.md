The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it does not handle the case where the input array `arr` contains `NaT` values and needs to be cast to an integer type. 

The buggy function fails to handle the case where the input array contains `NaT` values, which are not finite, and it needs to be cast to an integer type. The failing test case expects the function to raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". However, the buggy function does not handle this scenario and therefore fails the test.

To fix this bug, the function should explicitly check for `NaT` values in the input array and raise a `ValueError` when trying to cast them to an integer type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    # existing code

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # existing code
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the input array `arr` has a dtype of integer and the desired dtype is also an integer. If this condition is true and the input array contains non-finite values, we raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.

After this change, the `astype_nansafe` function should pass the failing test case.
