### Analysis
The error indicates that the function `astype_nansafe` is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when trying to convert a NaT value to an integer. This means that the conditions for identifying NaT values and raising an error are not working properly within the function. The specific error messages point to the cases where either `arr` is a datetime64 type or a timedelta64 type.

### Bug
The bug seems to be occurring in the sections where the function checks for datetime64 or timedelta64 types in the `arr` and tries to convert them based on the given `dtype`. It seems that the conditions and checks related to NaT values in these cases are not functioning as expected, leading to the function not raising a `ValueError` as it should.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the condition for NaT values in datetime and timedelta types to ensure that they are properly identified and dealt with.
2. Add proper checks and handling for NaT values, especially when converting to integer types, to ensure that the function raises a `ValueError` when appropriate.

### The Corrected Version

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # (remaining code is the same)

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslib.ints_to_pydatetime(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            if isna(arr).any():
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
            return arr.view(dtype)

        # allow frequency conversions
        if dtype.kind == "M":
            return arr.astype(dtype)

        raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a datetimelike from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if is_object_dtype(dtype):
            return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))
        elif dtype == np.int64:
            if isna(arr).any():
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
            return arr.view(dtype)

        if dtype not in [_INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE]:

            # allow frequency conversions
            # we return a float here!
            if dtype.kind == "m":
                mask = isna(arr)
                result = arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)
                result[mask] = np.nan
                return result
        elif dtype == _TD_DTYPE:
            return arr.astype(_TD_DTYPE, copy=copy)

        raise TypeError(f"cannot astype a timedelta from [{arr.dtype}] to [{dtype}]")

    # (remaining code is the same)
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for identifying NaT values and raising a `ValueError` have been added for the cases where `dtype` is an integer and the input array contains datetime or timedelta values. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing tests.
