The buggy function astype_nansafe() is being used to convert NaT values (representing Not a Time) in an array to integer type. However, the function is not handling NaT values properly, leading to a ValueError not being raised as expected.

The potential error in the function seems to be in the part of the code that checks for NaT values for datetime and timedelta arrays, and the handling of conversion to integer.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to handle the conversion of NaT values to integer properly, leading to the ValueError not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case of NaT values and the conversion to integer type specifically.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (existing code)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta64) and np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (existing code)
```

With this correction, the function will specifically handle the case when the input array has NaT values for datetime or timedelta, and the ValueError will be raised as expected.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and handle NaT values appropriately for the specified data types.
