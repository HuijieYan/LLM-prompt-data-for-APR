From the given error message, it seems that the bug is related to the conversion of NaT values to an integer, which is causing the test to fail.

The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. However, it appears that there is an issue with the conversion of NaT values to integers.

The issue reported in GitHub titled "BUG: Don't cast categorical nan to int" seems to be a related issue. It mentions a similar problem where converting categorical series back into an Int column converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `astype_nansafe` function to handle the conversion of NaT values to integers correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        # Handle conversion of NaT to integer
        if np.isnat(arr).any():
            if dtype == np.int64:
                return np.datetime64("NaT").astype(dtype)
            else:
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we specifically check if the input array contains NaT values and if the target dtype is an integer. We then handle the conversion of NaT to the integer type accordingly.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the related GitHub issue. It ensures that NaT values are correctly handled when casting to integer types.
