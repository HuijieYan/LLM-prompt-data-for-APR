Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it appears that the buggy function is causing an incorrect conversion of NaN values to integer datatype, leading to unexpected results and errors.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the cause of the bug is related to the handling of NaN values during the conversion process, specifically when converting from categorical to integer. This results in values being converted to incorrect integers, such as a large negative value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the astype_nansafe function in the pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py file. The error occurs when casting NaN values to integer type. To handle NaN values properly, we need to check for NaN values before the conversion and ensure that they are properly handled during the casting process.

Here's the corrected version of the astype_nansafe function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # existing code here...

    # check for NaN values when casting to integer
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    # other conditions and conversions...

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for NaN values when converting to integer type. If NaN values are present, we raise a ValueError to prevent the conversion, ensuring that NaN values are not incorrectly converted to integers.

This change should handle the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring that the conversion from categorical to integer properly handles NaN values.
