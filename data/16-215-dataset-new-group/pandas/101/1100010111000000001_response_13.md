The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it fails to handle the case where a `np.datetime64("NaT")` or `np.timedelta64("NaT")` value is provided and the target dtype is `np.int64`. In this case, the function should raise a `ValueError` with a specific message, but it currently fails to do so.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to add a conditional check at the beginning of the function to handle the case of `np.datetime64("NaT")` or `np.timedelta64("NaT")` when the target dtype is `np.int64`. In this case, the function should raise a `ValueError` with the specific message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer".

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if (dtype == np.int64) and (np.isnat(arr).any()):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this updated version of the function, it will correctly handle the case of `np.datetime64("NaT")` or `np.timedelta64("NaT")` when the target dtype is `np.int64`, and it will pass the failing test.
