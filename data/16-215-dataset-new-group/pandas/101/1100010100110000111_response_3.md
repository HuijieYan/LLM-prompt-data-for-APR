The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function appears to be related to the conversion of categorical data to integer data type, specifically when handling NaN values.

In the provided failing test, the input values `val = numpy.datetime64('NaT')` and `typ = <class 'numpy.int64'>` result in the error message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer", suggesting that the function is encountering issues with converting NaN values to integers.

The GitHub issue "BUG: Don't cast categorical nan to int" and its description indicate a similar problem, where converting from categorical to int ignores NaNs, resulting in unexpected integer values instead of NaN.

To fix this bug, you should update the `astype_nansafe` function to handle NaN values properly when performing the conversion to integer data type.

Here's the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same, only the following part is changed)

    if is_object_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and isna(arr).any():
        arr = arr.copy()
        arr[isna(arr)] = np.nan

    if dtype.name in ("datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        msg = (
            f"The '{dtype.name}' dtype has no unit. Please pass in "
            f"'{dtype.name}[ns]' instead."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Explicit copy, or required since NumPy can't view from / to object.
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In this corrected version, a new check has been added to handle categorical data containing NaN values. When the input array contains NaN values and the target dtype is an integer, the function makes a copy of the array and replaces NaN values with actual `np.nan` values before performing the conversion.

This change ensures that NaN values are properly handled when converting categorical data to integer data type. With this correction, the failing test case should be resolved, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should also be addressed.
