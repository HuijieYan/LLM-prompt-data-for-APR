#### Analysis:
The `astype_nansafe` function seems to be failing when trying to convert NaN values to integer in the `astyp_nansafe` function. This is supported by the error message from the failing test, which states "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". The GitHub issue also points out a similar problem with converting categorical values to integers.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for converting NaN values to integers seems to be causing the issue.
2. The conditional checks for datetime and timedelta dtype conversions also need to be inspected.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle NaN values correctly when converting to integer types, which results in the unexpected negative integer value "-9223372036854775808".

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Add a conditional check to specifically handle the conversion of NaN to a suitable value when converting to an integer type.
- Ensure that the logic for dtype checks and conversion covers all edge cases, including NaN values and categorical types.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.integer) and np.isnan(arr).any():
        return np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```
In the corrected version, a conditional check has been added to directly return an empty array of the specified type if the input array contains NaN values and is being converted to an integer type. This ensures that NaN values are handled correctly during the type conversion.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
