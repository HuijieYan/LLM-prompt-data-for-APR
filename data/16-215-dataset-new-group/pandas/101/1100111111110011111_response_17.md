### Analysis
The bug occurs when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. The astype_nansafe function is not handling NaN values correctly when casting to integer data types. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors when attempting to convert categorical data to integers.

### Bug Location
The cause of the bug can be traced to the conditional checks within the astype_nansafe function. The function is not correctly handling the case where NaN values are present in the input array.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is related to the handling of NaN values in the astype_nansafe function. When converting categorical data to integer data types, the function does not appropriately handle NaN values. This results in unexpected behavior and errors when NaN values are present in the input array.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that NaN values are handled appropriately when converting categorical data to integer data types. This may involve explicitly handling NaN values as missing, or converting NaN values to an appropriate representation in the integer data type.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g., the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (omitting other parts for brevity)

    if dtype.kind in ('u', 'i') and np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.isnan(arr).any():
        return arr.astype(dtype).astype(np.float64)

    # ... (omitting other parts for brevity)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```
This corrected version of the astype_nansafe function handles the specific case where the dtype is an integer type, and the array contains NaN values. It addresses the issue of converting categorical data with NaN values to integer data types, ensuring that NaN values are appropriately handled during the conversion process.
