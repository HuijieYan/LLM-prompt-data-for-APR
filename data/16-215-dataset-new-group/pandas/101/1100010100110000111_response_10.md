### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is meant to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The bug occurs when trying to convert categorical Series containing NaNs to an integer dtype. This results in the NaN values being converted to an unexpected negative value, causing the test to fail with a `ValueError` that is not being raised as expected.

### Bug Location
The bug seems to be occurring in the `astype_nansafe` function when handling categorical data and trying to convert NaNs to integer dtypes. This is causing the failing test to not raise a `ValueError` as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `astype_nansafe` function to properly handle the conversion of categorical data with NaNs to integer dtypes. This includes ensuring that NaN values are correctly handled and not converted to unexpected negative values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # update this function to handle the conversion of categorical data to integer dtypes in a nan-safe manner
    if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if dtype == 'int':
            return arr.astype('Int32')

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
By adding a specific check for categorical data and handling the conversion to integer dtype with the 'Int32' type, we can ensure that the NaNs are correctly handled and not converted to unexpected negative values.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
