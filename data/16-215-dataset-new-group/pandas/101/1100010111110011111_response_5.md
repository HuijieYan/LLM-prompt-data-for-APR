The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function arises from the handling of NaN values when casting a numpy array to a given dtype. When the function encounters NaN values and attempts to convert them to an integer, it fails to raise the appropriate ValueError.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that NaN values in a categorical series are not being properly handled when converting to an integer, leading to unexpected negative integer values. This aligns with the failing test case, where NaN values are being converted to integers without raising the appropriate error.

The bug is likely located in the section of the function that handles the conversion of NaN values to integers. This is indicated by the failing test case, the error message, and the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `astype_nansafe` function should be updated to appropriately handle NaN values when converting to an integer dtype. Specifically, when encountering NaN values, the function should raise a ValueError to indicate that NaN values cannot be converted to an integer.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # The following block is added to handle NaN values appropriately
    if skipna and isna(arr).any():  # Check if there are NaN values
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

With this correction, the function now checks for the presence of NaN values and appropriately raises a ValueError when attempting to convert them to an integer dtype.

This correction should resolve the bug and cause the failing test case to pass, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
