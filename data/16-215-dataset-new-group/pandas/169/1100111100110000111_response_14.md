## The buggy function and the related function description
The buggy function is `def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear")` inside the DataFrame class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. This function returns the values at the given quantile over the requested axis. It calls the `_check_percentile` method to validate the input `q`, and then manipulates the data accordingly to return the calculated quantiles for a DataFrame. The related call chain includes methods from the same class, such as `_get_numeric_data` and `_get_axis_number`, as well as methods from other classes like `Rolling.quantile` and `numpy.percentile`.

## Identified potential error location
The error could be occurring in this section of the function:
```python
if result.ndim == 2:
    result = self._constructor(result)
else:
    result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
```
This error could be related to the handling of the `result` variable and how it is constructed or sliced, potentially leading to the need for at least one array to concatenate.

## Explanation of the bug
Based on the provided error message and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of data for a DataFrame with datetime data. When calling the `quantile` method on a DataFrame with datetime data, it raises a ValueError indicating that at least one array is needed to concatenate. This suggests an issue with the creation and processing of the data, possibly related to the result being an empty array or improperly formatted data.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the result data is correctly handled and that the concatenation process has valid input. This may involve validating the data and adjusting the processing or transformation steps for datetime data in the DataFrame.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (Parameters and Examples remain unchanged) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2 and len(result) != 0:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    elif result.ndim == 1 and len(result) != 0:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid result data")

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
The corrected function handles the result data based on the dimension and length of the `result` array. It checks if the `result` array is not empty before constructing or slicing it into a Series or DataFrame. Additionally, it raises a ValueError if the result data is invalid. These changes address the potential error location and ensure correct handling of the result data.
