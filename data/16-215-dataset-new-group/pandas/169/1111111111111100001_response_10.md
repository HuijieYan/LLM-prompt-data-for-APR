The bug in the `quantile` function appears to be related to the construction of the `result` variable. The `self._constructor` and `self._constructor_sliced` methods are used to construct the result based on the dimensionality of the `data`, but the logic for constructing `result` seems to be inconsistent. This leads to unexpected behavior and causes the failing test.

The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`, which suggests that an attempt to concatenate arrays is being made with insufficient data, likely due to an incorrect construction of `result`.

To fix the bug, the logic for constructing `result` needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it matches the expected behavior based on the dimensionality of the input `data`.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
        result = pd.Series(result, index=self.columns)
    else:
        result = pd.DataFrame(result, index=q, columns=self.columns)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the `result` is constructed based on the dimensionality of the input data and matches the expected behavior explained in the function's docstring.
