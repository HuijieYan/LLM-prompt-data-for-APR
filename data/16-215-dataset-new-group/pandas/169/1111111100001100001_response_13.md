The bug in the given function lies in the incorrect manipulation of the data and the return of the result. The function is not handling the input data correctly and therefore producing incorrect output.

The bug seems to be occurring when the function attempts to calculate the quantile on the `data` DataFrame. It also seems to be incorrectly transposing the data, leading to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the function should check for the data type of the input `q` to determine whether to return a Series or a DataFrame. It should also handle the transposed and non-transposed cases properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    if axis in [0, 'index']:
        is_transposed = False
    elif axis in [1, 'columns']:
        is_transposed = True
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid axis value")

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, interpolation=interpolation, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0)

    if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
        result = result.rename(str(q))

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we handle the transposed and non-transposed cases, calculate the quantile, and appropriately handle the return type based on the input `q`.

This approach should fix the bug and ensure the function returns the expected results.
