The bug in the `quantile` function seems to be related to the data manipulation process and the dimensional transformation. The current implementation is not handling the input data and transposition properly, which results in an Empty DataFrame being returned.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle transposition and axis manipulation, as well as ensure the data is correctly processed based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # Apply transposition if axis is 1
    if axis == 1:
        data = data.T

    # Compute quantiles
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the logic for applying transposition and computing quantiles is simplified and improved. The `data.quantile` method is used to compute the quantiles based on the input parameters.

This should address the bug and provide the correct quantile values for the given input.
