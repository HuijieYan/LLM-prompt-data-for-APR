To resolve the issues with the provided buggy function and the failing test, we first need to understand the existing problems. 

1. The failing test called `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` from `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` fails because it expects a DataFrame to return just as a Series does, but the current implementation doesn't handle this case properly when the DataFrame has no columns.

2. The error message from the failing test suggests that during the computation of quantiles, there is an empty array being passed for concatenation, causing a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.

3. During the execution of the failing test, the buggy implementation of the `quantile` function results in inconsistencies in the input parameters and the variables' values within the function: `data` and `data.T` are both empty DataFrames, indicating that the initial DataFrame is being processed incorrectly. This leads to the concatenation error mentioned in the error message. Additionally, the `_check_percentile` method is called on `self`, which may be causing inconsistencies in the expected and actual behavior.

To fix the bug, we should revise the `quantile` function to properly handle cases where the DataFrame has no columns. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the `data` DataFrame is not empty before proceeding with quantile computation.

Here's the updated version of the `quantile` function that resolves the issues and is expected to pass the failing test:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

    If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned
    where the index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
    values are the quantiles.
    If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned
    where the index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """

    # Check if the DataFrame is empty
    if self.empty:
        return self  # Return the empty DataFrame itself

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This revised implementation adds a check for an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the function and returns the DataFrame itself if it is indeed empty. This addresses the issue of handling an empty DataFrame as required by the failing test.
