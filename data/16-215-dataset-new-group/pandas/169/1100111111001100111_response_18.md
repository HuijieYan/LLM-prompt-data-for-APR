The issue you're running into with the `quantile` function appears to be related to datetime data and the resulting concatenation error.

The cause of the bug is that when the `quantile` function is called with a DataFrame containing datetime data, the `_get_numeric_data` function returns an empty DataFrame. This leads to a concatenation error when attempting to compute the quantile. 

To fix this bug, you can modify the `quantile` function to handle datetime data correctly, ensuring that the appropriate data is used for the quantile computation.

Here's a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])  # Only select numeric columns
    else:
        data = self
    
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)
    
    return result
```

This corrected version of the `quantile` function correctly selects numeric columns if `numeric_only` is set to `True`, and then computes the quantile based on the selected data, ensuring that the datetime data doesn't interfere with the computation.

I hope this helps to resolve the issue you've been experiencing!
