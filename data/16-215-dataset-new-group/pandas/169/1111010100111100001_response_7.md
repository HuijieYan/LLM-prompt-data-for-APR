In the provided buggy function, the `quantile` method of the DataFrame class is trying to calculate the quantile over the requested axis based on the provided parameters `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`. However, there are issues with the function which are causing it to fail. 

The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. This error arises from a concatenation operation within the function.

Upon analyzing the runtime input/output values for the buggy function, it is observed that the `data` variable is an empty DataFrame, and the concatenation operation leads to the ValueError. This suggests that the issue lies in how the `data` DataFrame is handled within the `quantile` method.

## Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `data` variable contains non-empty data before performing concatenation. This can be achieved by checking if the `data` DataFrame is empty, and if so, returning a suitable value instead of attempting to perform the quantile computation.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    if data.empty:
        return pd.DataFrame()
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, before attempting the quantile computation, it is checked whether the `data` DataFrame is empty. If so, an empty DataFrame is returned as the result. This prevents the concatenation operation from failing with a ValueError.
