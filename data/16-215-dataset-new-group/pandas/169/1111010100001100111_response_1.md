The issue seems to be related to the DataFrame's `quantile` method when applied to datetime data. It appears that the error is occurring when trying to concatenate the arrays, as indicated by the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error message.

The issue is likely related to how the DataFrame's `quantile` method handles datetime data and may not be correctly identifying it as numeric data. This could be causing the function to fail during the quantile calculation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle datetime data and ensure that the quantile calculation works as expected for both Series and DataFrame objects. The fix should involve appropriate type checking and handling of datetime data when calculating quantiles.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if (not numeric_only) and self._is_homogeneous_type(include=['datetime', 'timedelta']):
        data = self
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `numeric_only` attribute is false and the DataFrame contains datetime or timedelta data. If so, we use the DataFrame itself for the quantile calculation. Otherwise, we obtain the numeric data using the `_get_numeric_data` method.

By making this adjustment, the `quantile` method will correctly handle datetime and timedelta data, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
