The bug seems to be with the variable `data` that is not being set correctly. It is being set as an Empty DataFrame regardless of the input `self` DataFrame. Additionally, the variable `is_transposed` is being set as `False` regardless of the input `axis` value.

The bug occurs because the `self._get_numeric_data()` call is not correctly retrieving the numeric data from the input DataFrame. This causes `data` to be an Empty DataFrame, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._get_numeric_data()` call is correctly retrieving the numeric data from the input DataFrame. Additionally, the variable `is_transposed` should be set based on the input `axis` value.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 'columns'

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we are using the `self._get_numeric_data()` method to retrieve the numeric data from the input DataFrame. We also set the `is_transposed` variable based on the input `axis` value. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct results.
