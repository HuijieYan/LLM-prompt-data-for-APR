The bug arises from the conditional expression on line 89 where the `result` is assigned. The issue on GitHub confirms that the quantile method of a DataFrame is failing when provided with datetime data. The failing tests reflect that the `result` variable is incorrect, leading to the failing test due to the concatenation occurring without any arrays.

The strategy to fix the bug is to change the conditional expression on line 89 to correctly handle the case when the result is a Series or DataFrame. This can be achieved by validating the dimension of the result and creating an appropriate object based on the dimension. By handling the conditional expression correctly, the bug can be resolved and the failing test will pass.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=(axis == 1)
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return self._constructor(result, index=self.columns)
    else:
        return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q, index=self.columns)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue encountered with datetime data and pass the failing test.
