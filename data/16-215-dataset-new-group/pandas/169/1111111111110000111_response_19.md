It appears that the `DataFrame` class has two identical `quantile` functions, the second of which contains the bug. The bug seems to be caused by the attempt to concatenate empty data, likely due to data manipulation issues.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `quantile` function handles the case of empty data properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:
        # Handle the case of empty data to avoid the concatenation error
        if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
            # When q is a single float or int
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
        else:
            # When q is an array-like
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q)

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we added a check for empty data at the beginning of the function. If the data is empty, it returns an empty `Series` when `q` is a single value, or an empty `DataFrame` when `q` is an array-like.

By adding this check, we can handle the case of empty data properly, preventing the error caused by attempting to concatenate empty arrays.

With this corrected issue, the `DataFrame` should now return just as a `Series` does, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
