Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is occurring when a DataFrame with datetime data is passed to the `quantile` function. The failing test case provides a DataFrame with datetime data, and the error message from the failing test indicates that there is an issue with concatenating the datetime data for quantile calculation.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of datetime data in the `quantile` function. DataFrames with datetime data should be handled appropriately to compute quantiles. The issue with concatenating the datetime data can be resolved by ensuring that datetime data is properly converted to numeric data before applying the quantile calculation.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        # Transpose the data
        data = data.T

    result_values = []
    for col in data.columns:
        quantile_val = data[col].quantile(q=q, interpolation=interpolation)
        result_values.append(quantile_val)

    if len(result_values) == 1:
        # Return a series
        return pd.Series(result_values[0], index=data.columns)
    else:
        # Return a DataFrame
        return pd.DataFrame(result_values, index=q, columns=data.columns)
```

In this corrected version, I modified the function to calculate the quantile on each column of the DataFrame separately. I removed calls to internal methods such as `_data.quantile` and updated the logic to calculate the quantile for each column individually. This approach should handle both numeric and datetime data appropriately, ensuring that the DataFrame returns results similar to a Series.

After the modification, run the failing test cases to ensure that the corrected function passes the tests and resolves the issue.
