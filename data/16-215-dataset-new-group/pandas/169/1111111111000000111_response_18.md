The buggy function provided is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The issue is that when the `quantile` method is called on a DataFrame with datetime data, it raises a ValueError instead of returning the expected result.

Upon analyzing the method, it seems like the issue occurs when calling the `self._constructor` method in the `quantile` function. This method is responsible for constructing a new DataFrame but it may be encountering an issue when dealing with datetime data.

The cause of the bug is that the `_constructor` method is not properly handling datetime data when creating a new DataFrame object. This leads to the ValueError being raised instead of returning the expected result.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to make sure that the `_constructor` method is able to handle datetime data properly and construct a new DataFrame without encountering any issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (Rest of the docstring remains the same) ...

    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=data.index, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q, index=data.index)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By modifying the call to `_constructor` and providing the proper parameters such as `index` and `columns`, the corrected version of the `quantile` function should now be able to handle datetime data and return the expected result.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `quantile` function works as expected, passing the failing test.
