The bug seems to be related to the handling of DateTime data in the `quantile` function of the DataFrame class. The failing test related to the DataFrame with DateTime data is raising a "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" error. This suggests that the DataFrame with DateTime data is not being handled correctly within the quantile function.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the extraction of numeric data and the transpose operation. It appears that the `data` variable is not being handled correctly when DateTime data is involved.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to check the data type of the columns and handle DateTimes differently from other numeric data. Specifically, when preparing the data for quantile calculations, a check is needed to distinguish between DateTime and other numeric data, and transpose operations should be bypassed for DateTimes.

Here's a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    # Get the numeric data, handling DateTime data separately
    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
        date_columns = [col for col in data.columns if np.issubdtype(data[col].dtype, np.datetime64)]
        data_without_date_cols = data.drop(columns=date_columns)
    else:
        data = self
        data_without_date_cols = data
        
    # Prepare data for quantile calculations
    if axis == 1:
        data = data.T
        
    result = data_without_date_cols._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=False)
    
    # If date columns exist, calculate quantile for them as well
    if len(date_columns) > 0:
        date_quantiles = {}
        for col in date_columns:
            date_quantiles[col] = data[col].quantile(q)
        date_quantile_series = pd.Series(date_quantiles, name=q)
        result = result.join(date_quantile_series)
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if axis == 1:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function includes specific handling for DateTime data when extracting numeric data and preparing the data for quantile calculations. The check for DateTimes along with bypassing the transpose operation should resolve the bug.

With this correction, the failing test related to the DataFrame with DateTime data should pass, and the GitHub issue should be closed.
