The potential error in the buggy function is likely with the concatenation of arrays in the `quantile` method when the dataframe has no columns, as indicated by the failing test and the ValueError stating "need at least one array to concatenate."

The root cause of the bug is that when a DataFrame has no columns, the quantile method is attempting to concatenate an empty array which is causing a ValueError.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to add a check within the `quantile` method to handle the case where the DataFrame has no columns, and directly return an empty Series or DataFrame accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    (function body remains unchanged)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
        (return explanation remains unchanged)
    """

    # New check added to handle the case where the DataFrame has no columns
    if len(self.columns) == 0:
        if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
        else:
            return pd.DataFrame({q: []})

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a check for empty columns at the beginning of the `quantile` method, the function will now handle the case where the DataFrame has no columns, and it will return an empty Series or DataFrame accordingly. This will ensure that the ValueError is not raised in such cases and the function will pass the failing test.
