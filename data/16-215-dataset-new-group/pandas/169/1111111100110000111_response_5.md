The source of the bug is in the `DataFrame.quantile` method, where it is failing to concatenate the date data when performing the quantile calculation.

The cause of the bug is that when `DataFrame.quantile` method is called on a DataFrame with datetime data, the method attempts to create this quantile object by concatenating the data first. However, since datetime data does not suitably concatenate and the method is not handling this case, it results in a ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate".

To fix this bug, the `DataFrame.quantile` method should be modified to handle datetime data differently. Specifically, it should not try to concatenate the datetime data, but rather directly calculate the quantile from the original data.

The corrected version of the `DataFrame.quantile` method is provided below:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(data.dtypes).any():
        return self._quantile(datetime, q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version will first check whether the data contains datetime or timedelta objects and then use a different method `_quantile` to calculate the quantile directly without attempting to concatenate the datetime data. This will resolve the ValueError that was encountered and allow the DataFrame to return just as a Series does, as expected.

This correction will also resolve the issue in the GitHub bug report, as it directly addresses the problem where the DataFrame was failing to return the quantile for datetime data.
