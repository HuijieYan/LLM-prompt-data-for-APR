In the provided DataFrame class, the quantile function is failing to handle date data correctly, resulting in a ValueError when using the quantile method with datetime data. This is happening because the function is expecting numeric data and transposing it in certain cases, causing issues with concatenating the data. 

The bug is also causing empty DataFrames to be generated in both Case 1 and Case 2, which is inappropriate given the input data.

To fix this bug, we will modify the quantile function to handle datetime and timedelta data correctly, without transposing the data unnecessarily, and ensure it does not create empty DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the Quantile function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- The unnecessary handling of transposing the data has been removed.
- The check for whether q is an array has also been updated, and the appropriate DataFrame or Series is returned accordingly.
- Empty DataFrames will no longer be generated.

This corrected function should properly handle datetime and timedelta data, and correctly return Series and DataFrames based on the input 'q'.

This changes will resolve the bug, allowing the quantile method to work correctly with datetime data.
