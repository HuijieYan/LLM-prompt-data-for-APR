Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function is not handling the case when q is an array and the axis is 1 (columns).

Cause of the bug:
The bug may occur because when q is an array and the axis is set to 1, the function is transposing the data and then calculating the quantile. This can lead to incorrect results as the transposition may not be handled correctly.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the quantile is calculated correctly when q is an array and the axis is 1. This can be done by handling the transposition of data appropriately and then calculating the quantile.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=0 if is_transposed else 1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected version, we handle the case when q is an array and when axis is set to 1. We calculate the quantile accordingly and ensure that the transposition is handled correctly.
