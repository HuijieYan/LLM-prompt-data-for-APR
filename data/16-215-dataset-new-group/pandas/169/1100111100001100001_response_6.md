The bug in the `quantile` function seems to be related to the handling of the input data and the extraction of the necessary information for computing the quantiles. There are also discrepancies in the input parameter `q`, which is causing issues with the calculation and incorrect behavior.

The key issue is that the `data` variable is being incorrectly assigned as an empty DataFrame in both cases, which is causing the subsequent calculations to fail. Additionally, the `qs` parameter in the call to `quantile` should be either a scalar or an array-like, but it seems to be incorrectly processed when `q` is provided as a list in Case 2.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `data` variable is correctly assigned and the `qs` parameter is processed appropriately based on the input value of `q`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        qs = q
    else:
        qs = [q]

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    result = data.quantile(q=qs, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)
    
    return result
```

In this corrected version, we handle the input value of `q` to determine whether it's a single quantile or an array-like of quantiles. We then use this information to call the `quantile` method on the `data` variable, ensuring that the calculations are performed correctly.

This should address the issues observed in the failing tests and provide the expected results for computing quantiles from the DataFrame.
