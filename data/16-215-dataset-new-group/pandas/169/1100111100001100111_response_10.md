The bug in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class in pandas is causing issues when dealing with datetime data. The bug is manifesting as a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` when trying to calculate the quantile of a DataFrame that contains datetime data.

The issue lies in the incorrect reshaping of the data into a transposed format when calculating the quantile. Specifically, in the buggy function, when the method tries to transpose the data, it's not correctly handling datetime data, which leads to an error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the transposition is handled correctly, especially when dealing with datetime data. This can be done by identifying the datatype of the data and not trying to transpose it if it's datetime data.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = None
    if not is_datetime_dtype(data.iloc[0]):
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    else:
        # Datetime data, no transposition needed
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we check if the data contains datetime values by using the `is_datetime_dtype` method. If the data is of datetime type, no transposition is performed, and the quantile is calculated directly. Otherwise, the data is transposed, and the quantile is calculated as before.

This fix ensures that when dealing with datetime data, the transposition that was causing the error is avoided, and the quantile calculation proceeds correctly.
