## The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with test code, corresponding error message, and the GitHub issue is as follows:

First off, the `quantile` method is a method of the DataFrame class in the pandas library. The bug is causing an AttributeError in the DataFrame.quantile method. This method should return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The bug stems from the quantile method not working correctly with datetime data in DataFrame.

The failing test "test_quantile_empty_no_columns" attempts to invoke df.quantile(0.5) and df.quantile([0.5]). The expected output is an empty DataFrame or Series object depending on the invocation, as specified in the test.

The corresponding error message is a ValueError stating: "need at least one array to concatenate."

The GitHub issue "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" describes the problem. When trying to use the DataFrame.quantile method with datetime data, it raises a ValueError instead of working as expected.

## Identification of potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The use of `data = self._get_numeric_data()` seems to be problematic as it only gets numeric data, which might not work well with datetime data.
2. The `data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)` line of code might not be handling datetime data correctly, resulting in the ValueError.

The cause of the bug is that the quantile method for DataFrame does not handle datetime data properly, leading to the ValueError when dealing with datetime data specifically. The test code showcased the failure of the DataFrame.quantile method to work properly with datetime data, which prompted the GitHub issue to report the problem.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by modifying the code to handle datetime data properly. This can be done by revising the logic of how the datetime data is processed and accounted for in the quantile calculation. It might involve checking the data types and branching the logic accordingly to handle datetime data appropriately.

## The corrected version of the function:

Here's the corrected version of the function that should resolve the bug:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
  
    ... # rest of the function remains unchanged
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Handle datetime and numeric data
    if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame) and data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime']).shape[1] > 0:
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if the DataFrame contains datetime data. If it does, we use the built-in DataFrame.quantile method to handle the calculation specifically for datetime data. Otherwise, we continue with the original logic for numeric data. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function work correctly with datetime data.
