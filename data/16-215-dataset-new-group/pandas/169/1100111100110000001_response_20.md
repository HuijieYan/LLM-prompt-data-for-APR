The buggy function is the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class in the file `pandas/core/frame.py`. The error message is indicating a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` when trying to compute the quantile.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the `data._data.quantile()` call because it attempts to concatenate arrays but is failing due to having no arrays to concatenate.

The cause of the bug is that the `data` variable might not have any numeric data, which leads to an empty result and causes a failure when attempting to concatenate the arrays as part of the quantile computation.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to ensure that the `data` variable contains numeric data before proceeding with the quantile computation. If it does not have any numeric data, we should return an appropriate result without attempting the computation.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()
    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor(result)

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected version, we check if the `data` is empty, and if so, we return an appropriate result without attempting the computation. This ensures that the function can handle cases where no numeric data is present, preventing the ValueError from occurring.
