The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class from the file `pandas/core/frame.py` is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The function takes the input parameters `q` (quantile value), `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`. It then proceeds to perform percentile calculations on the DataFrame's data.

The error message from the failing test indicates a ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate". This implies that the function is trying to concatenate empty arrays, which is likely being caused by the data processing logic within the function.

Analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the function for the failing tests, we can identify that `data` is empty, which leads to the concatenation issue when attempting percentiles calculation. 

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the data retrieval logic to ensure that valid data is being used for percentile calculations. Specifically, we need to handle the case when there is empty data to prevent the concatenation error.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    if len(data) == 0:
        # Handle the case when there is no valid data to prevent concatenation error
        return data
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

In the updated version, we added a check to handle the case when the `data` is empty, returning it immediately to prevent further operations that would lead to the concatenation error. This modification ensures that the function can handle such edge cases and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
