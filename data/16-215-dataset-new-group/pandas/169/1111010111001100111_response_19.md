In the given code, the bug lies in the quantile function of the DataFrame class. The issue is related to the quantile result when using datetime data, as highlighted in the GitHub issue "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data."

The bug is specifically related to the `self._constructor` and `self._constructor_sliced` calls in the buggy function which expects `result` to have a dimension of 2 if `q` is an array to return a DataFrame, and otherwise expects a dimension of 1 to return a Series. This expectation is not met due to an incorrect condition that checks for the dimension of the `result` data.

The mentions of "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" in the GitHub issue further confirm this bug.

To fix the bug, the condition to determine whether to return a DataFrame or Series based on the dimension of the `result` should be modified.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # existing code
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if isinstance(q, list):
        # Return a DataFrame
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=self.columns)
    else:
        # Return a Series
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
        
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version introduces an additional check based on the data type of `q` to distinguish between the two return types. If `q` is a list, it returns a DataFrame; otherwise, it returns a Series, addressing the issue highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
