Based on the GitHub issue, the problem occurs when using the `quantile` function with a DataFrame containing datetime data. The issue is related to the `quantile` function in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file.

Potential error location:
The problematic area is likely related to the internal implementation of quantile computation for DataFrame, as it seems to lead to value concatenation issues.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the internal implementation of the `quantile` function, where it fails to handle datetime data appropriately and results in a concatenation error.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The internal implementation of the `quantile` function needs to be modified to handle datetime data correctly and avoid the concatenation error.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Modified solution to handle datetime data correctly
    result = data.aggregate('quantile', q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the `quantile` function now uses the `aggregate` method to compute the quantile, which handles datetime data appropriately and avoids the concatenation error.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, where using the `quantile` function with a DataFrame containing datetime data raises a ValueError. The corrected version ensures that the DataFrame returns just as a Series does, as expected.
