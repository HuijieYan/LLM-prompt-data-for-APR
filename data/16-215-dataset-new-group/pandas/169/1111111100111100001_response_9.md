The buggy function `quantile` from the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas.core.frame` module is throwing a `ValueError` with the message "need at least one array to concatenate" when it is called by the failing test cases.

In the `Case 1` and `Case 2` runtime scenarios, the bug appears to stem from the fact that the `data` variable is being initialized as an empty DataFrame, leading to an empty `BlockManager` in `data._data`. This empty `BlockManager` causes the `ValueError` when the `quantile` function attempts to perform concatenation operations.

To address this issue, we can modify the code to ensure that the `data` variable is not erroneously initialized as an empty DataFrame when fetching numeric data. We can also handle the case when `q` is a list, by checking if it is an instance of a list and then performing the necessary operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty or (isinstance(q, list) and not q):
        # Handle the case when data is empty or q is an empty list
        return self._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.columns)
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to handle the case when `data` is empty or when `q` is an empty list. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns a constructed DataFrame with NaN values based on the columns of the original DataFrame. This ensures that concatenation operations do not encounter an empty DataFrame or an empty list, ultimately resolving the `ValueError`.
