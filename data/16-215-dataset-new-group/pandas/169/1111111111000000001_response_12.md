The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class of the `pandas/core/frame.py` file has an issue with handling empty data frames. The `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` test is failing because the function is not returning the expected output when the input data frame is empty.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of an empty data frame properly, leading to unexpected results and failing the test. The function should check for the special case of an empty data frame and return the appropriate output as expected by the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `quantile` function to check for the case of an empty data frame and return the correct output. We can add logic to handle this case at the beginning of the function and return an empty Series or DataFrame with the correct index and column names.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
        else:
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the check for an empty data frame at the beginning of the function, we ensure that the function handles this special case and returns the correct output as expected by the failing test.
