The potential location of the bug in the `quantile` function is the line: `result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)`. The issue from GitHub indicates that the DataFrame is not returning the result in the same way a Series does.

The bug seems to be related to the concatenation of the arrays, which results in a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. This is likely related to how the quantile method handles datetime data for DataFrames.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data is being manipulated and transposed correctly for datetime data. Additionally, the result returned for DataFrames should match the behavior of Series, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if isinstance(self, DataFrame) and isinstance(self[0], pd.DatetimeIndex):
        data = self.T
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we've added a condition to check if the DataFrame contains datetime data. If it does, we transpose the data before computing the quantile. This ensures that the behavior of quantile for DataFrames matches that of Series, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
