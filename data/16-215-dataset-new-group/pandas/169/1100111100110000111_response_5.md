The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class. When creating a new DataFrame `result`, the `concat` function might not work properly due to an incorrect structure of the input data.

The cause of the bug is that when using the `quantile` method with `DateTime` data, it raises a `ValueError` due to the incorrect handling of the transposed data and the `concat` function used for concatenating the results.

To fix the bug, you can modify the logic to properly handle transposed data and ensure that the `concat` function works correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Rest of the docstring remains the same...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._data if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling transposed data and creating the `result` DataFrame has been updated. This should resolve the issue related to incorrect concatenation and ensure that the `quantile` method works as expected, returning the correct DataFrame as the Series does.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
