The buggy function `quantile` has several issues. It seems to be trying to calculate the quantile of a DataFrame using the `qs` parameter and the `axis` parameter, but it is not handling all the cases correctly. 

The variable `data` is determined to be an empty DataFrame, which indicates that the function is not correctly extracting the numeric data from the DataFrame `self`. Additionally, the `is_transposed` boolean is correctly determined to be `False`, indicating that the function is not correctly identifying the axis.

The bug seems to stem from the logic of extracting numeric data and handling transposed data within the function.

To fix this bug, the function needs to accurately identify and extract the numeric data from the DataFrame `self` based on the `numeric_only` parameter. It also needs to correctly identify the axis and handle the transposed data properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
    else:
        data = self

    if axis in (0, 'index'):
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation)
    elif axis in (1, 'columns'):
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we use the `select_dtypes` method to extract numeric data if `numeric_only` is True. Then, we use the `quantile` method of the DataFrame to calculate quantiles along the specified axis based on the input parameters.

This should fix the issues with the original implementation and accurately calculate the quantiles of the DataFrame.
