The bug is likely caused by the incorrect processing of the input data within the function. The 'data' variable contains an empty DataFrame, and there is no data to compute the quantile, leading to unexpected and incorrect behavior in both cases. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input DataFrame is properly processed and that the 'data' variable contains the correct data for quantile computation. We should also verify the relationship between the 'is_transposed' variable and the 'data' variable to ensure that the handling of transposed data is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the 'quantile' function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data(self) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- We have fixed the call to the '_get_numeric_data' method to correctly pass the 'self' parameter.
- We have used the 'axis' variable instead of hardcoded 'axis=1' in the call to 'data._data.quantile'.
- We have also used the 'axis' variable instead of hardcoded 'axis=1' when checking for transposed data.

This corrected version takes into account the input data and axis, ensuring that the quantile computation is performed correctly.
