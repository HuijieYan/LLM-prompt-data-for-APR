## Analysis
The given error message indicates that the `ValueError` is occurring in the `concat` module when trying to concatenate arrays. The issue seems to be related to the method `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class which is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The issue on GitHub further describes the problem, stating that the quantile method does not work correctly with datetime data in a DataFrame.

## Error Location
The error is most likely occurring within the `quantile` function when it tries to handle datetime data. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the handling of datetime data when calling `quantile` on a DataFrame.

## Cause of the Bug
The root cause of the bug is observed as being related to the creation of quantiles with datetime data in a DataFrame, which is not handled correctly, leading to the ValueError during array concatenation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the handling of datetime data should be modified within the `quantile` function and necessary changes should be made to ensure that datetime arrays can be concatenated correctly without raising a ValueError.

## Corrected Version
```python
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        self._check_percentile(q)
    
        # Get data specifically based on logic for numeric values
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]) if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        
        # Apply quantile function
        result = data._quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)
        
        return result
```
In this corrected version, we make sure to get only the numeric data and apply the `_quantile` function where the bug is occurring. This will handle datetime and other non-numeric data correctly.
