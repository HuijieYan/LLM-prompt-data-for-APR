The bug in the function `quantile` seems to be related to the data processing and the handling of transposed data. Based on the input parameters and the runtime values of the variables, it appears that the function is not correctly processing the input DataFrame and producing unexpected results, such as empty DataFrames and BlockManagers. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input data is properly processed and that the transposition of the data is handled correctly. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        axis = 0  # Set axis to 0 for processing columns
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    is_transposed = axis == 1
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the input `q` is a list or an array, and based on this, we set the axis accordingly. We then perform the quantile calculation by calling `data.quantile()` with the proper axis and transposition. Finally, if `q` is a list or array, we transpose the result before returning it.
