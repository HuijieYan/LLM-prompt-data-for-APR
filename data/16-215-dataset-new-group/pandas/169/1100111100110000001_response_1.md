The buggy function is the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class of `pandas/core/frame.py`. The function is intended to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. However, there is an error being raised when this function is called with an empty DataFrame, resulting in a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.

The cause of the bug is that the `quantile` method does not handle the case of an empty DataFrame correctly. When an empty DataFrame is passed to this method, the internal logic leads to an attempt to concatenate arrays, which fails due to there being no arrays to concatenate. This results in the `ValueError` being raised.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` method needs to include a condition to handle the case of an empty DataFrame, returning an appropriate result without attempting to perform calculations that are not possible with an empty dataset.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        # Return an empty DataFrame if the input DataFrame is empty
        return self if isinstance(self, DataFrame) else Series(self)

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the first step is to check if the DataFrame is empty. If it is empty, the method returns the input DataFrame (if it's a DataFrame) or a Series (if it's a Series). This ensures that the method does not attempt to perform calculations on an empty dataset, avoiding the `ValueError` that was previously encountered.
