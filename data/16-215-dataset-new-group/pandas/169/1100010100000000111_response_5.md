Error locations within the buggy function:
1. The bug is likely caused by how the DataFrame is being handled differently from the Series. 
2. The issue occurs when the function quantile is called on a DataFrame with datetime data. This is evident from the GitHub issue description, where calling `pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range('1/1/18', periods=5)).quantile()` results in a ValueError.

Cause of the bug:
1. The bug is caused by the function not handling datetime data in DataFrames as expected, which results in a ValueError when calling the quantile function. 
2. The current implementation does not account for the difference in behavior between Series and DataFrames when working with datetime data.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Identify the specific code block responsible for handling datetime data in the quantile function for DataFrames and adjust it to handle datetime data correctly. 
2. Ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected output described in the GitHub issue, where the DataFrame should return the same way as the Series when calling the quantile function.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    (Remaining function comments with parameters and return type)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    (Remaining function return details)

    (Examples and See Also section remain unchanged)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    is_series = False
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    if issubclass(data.dtypes[0].type, np.datetime64):
        is_series = True

    if is_series:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
        )
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, a check is included to determine if the data is a Series or a DataFrame based on the datatype. Depending on the data type, the quantile is calculated and returned accordingly, aligning with the expected output and resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
