The buggy function appears to be called twice within the class `DataFrame`. It is also calling the `self._check_percentile(q)` function without checking if `q` is a list or a float, which leads to an error when `q` is a list.

The buggy function is also using the `self._get_numeric_data()` method to retrieve the numeric data, which may result in an empty DataFrame under certain conditions. This behavior does not align with the intended functionality of the `quantile` function.

To fix the bug, we should check the type of `q` before calling the `_check_percentile` method to avoid any errors caused by passing a list instead of a float. Additionally, we should revise the way we retrieve the data to ensure that it contains the necessary information as expected.

The corrected version of the buggy function is provided below:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if isinstance(q, list):
        raise ValueError("q cannot be a list, please provide a float value")

    data = self.select_dtypes(include=np.number) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the fixed version, we check whether `q` is a list and raise a `ValueError` if it is. We also use the `select_dtypes` method to retrieve the numeric data, ensuring that all necessary information is present.
