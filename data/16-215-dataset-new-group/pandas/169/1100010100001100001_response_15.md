The bug in the given function seems to be related to the way the data is being handled. It appears that there is an issue with the data manipulation and retrieval within the function, specifically with the `data` variable, which is being set to an empty DataFrame in both cases. This leads to incorrect quantile calculations and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `data` variable correctly represents the input DataFrame and that the quantile calculation is performed on the correct data.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    """
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we simplify the function by directly using the `quantile` method available for pandas DataFrames. This method correctly handles the quantile calculations based on the specified input parameters.

This revised approach should address the potential data manipulation issues and provide correct quantile calculations for both single quantile values and arrays of quantiles.
