The bug in the code seems to be related to the _get_numeric_data method not handling datetime data properly. When quantile is called on a DataFrame with datetime data, the error "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" is raised.

To fix this bug:
1. The modification needs to support datetime and timedelta data as well without causing the ValueError.
2. The frequency of occurrence of datetime and timedelta data in the DataFrame should also be taken care of in the modification.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
        ... (rest remains the same) ...
    """

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    transposed = axis == 1

    if transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Extract the data to be used for quantiles
    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number'])

    # When there is no numeric data
    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor()

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=transposed
    )

    # When the result is 1D, return a Series
    if result.ndim == 1:
        result = result.astype('object')  # convert to object type
        result.name = q
        result = Series(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor(result.T, columns=q, index=data.columns)

    return result
```

This modification ensures that datetime and timedelta data are handled properly, and the code should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
