## The Analysis
The cause of the bug has been identified as an issue with the calculation of quantile for datetime data in a DataFrame. It is leading to a ValueError when calling the `quantile` method on a DataFrame with datetime data.

## Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the buggy function are where the quantile is being computed for datetime data. This is leading to a ValueError.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect computation of quantile for datetime data in a DataFrame. The issue is with the `quantile` method implementation when the data includes datetime values. This is resulting in a `ValueError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic in the `quantile` method to handle datetime data properly. The method should be revised to compute quantile in a way that supports datetime data in a DataFrame.

## The Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `quantile` method is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if isinstance(self.iloc[0, 0], (np.datetime64, pd.Timestamp)):
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, I have added a check to detect if the DataFrame contains datetime values. If it does, the `quantile` method will handle the data differently to support datetime values. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
