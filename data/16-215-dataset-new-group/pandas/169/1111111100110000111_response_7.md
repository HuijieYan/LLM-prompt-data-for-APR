The cause of the bug is that the `quantile` function is throwing a `ValueError` with the message "need at least one array to concatenate." This happens when the `quantile` function is called on a DataFrame with datetime data.

The function `quantile` is defined in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file, within the `DataFrame` class. When the `quantile` method is called on a DataFrame object, it internally manipulates the data to calculate the quantiles. However, in the case of datetime data, an error occurs when trying to concatenate the arrays.

The cause of the error is that the `quantile` function does not handle datetime data correctly when attempting to calculate quantile values. Additionally, the error occurs due to the incorrect handling of concatenation.

To fix this bug, the logic for calculating quantiles for datetime data needs to be adjusted, and the concatenation of arrays should be updated to handle the datetime data appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    if not numeric_only and is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(data.dtypes):
        data = self

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, additional logic has been added to handle the case when `numeric_only` is `False` and the data contains datetime or timedelta types. This ensures that appropriate data handling is performed during the calculation of quantiles and that the arrays are concatenated correctly. This should resolve the issue stated in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
