The bug is in the `quantile` function of the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas.core.frame` module. This bug leads to an error when trying to use the `quantile` function on a DataFrame containing datetime data.

The bug is likely within the `quantile` function's implementation, specifically in the way it handles datetime data. The bug is triggered when calling `quantile` on a DataFrame with datetime data, which eventually leads to a ValueError stating that at least one array is needed to concatenate.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the `quantile` function is processing datetime data internally. The system tries to concatenate the datetime data in an unexpected way, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the internal implementation of the `quantile` function, specifically the part that deals with datetime data, needs to be modified to account for the correct data structure and to handle concatenation appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version leverages the existing `quantile` method available for the DataFrame instead of directly accessing the internal data structures. This should handle datetime data correctly and avoid the ValueError.
