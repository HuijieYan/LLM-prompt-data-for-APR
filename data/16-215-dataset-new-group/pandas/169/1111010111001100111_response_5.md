The potential source of the bug in the `quantile` function appears to be the incorrect construction of the `result` variable, leading to an output that does not match the expected values. Furthermore, the bug is clearly present when the function is used with datetime data due to an error related to concatenating arrays. This leads to an incorrect result, causing a failing test case and resulting in the issue posted on GitHub.

To fix the bug, the `result` array should be constructed correctly to ensure the function returns the expected output for both the `DataFrame` and `Series` inputs and resolves the issue on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q, axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return result
    else:
        return result.squeeze()
```

With this correction, the `quantile` function should now satisfy the failing test case and resolve the issue posted on GitHub, ensuring the correct behavior when used with datetime data as well as other data types.
