The bug in the `DataFrame.quantile` function seems to be causing an issue when handling datetime data, leading to a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.

From the provided details, it seems that the bug is specifically related to the treatment of `datetime` data within the `DataFrame.quantile` method. The failing test cases also provide insights into the runtime values and types of variables, suggesting that the behavior of the function is incorrect when working with empty data.

The cause of the bug is related to the manipulation of empty dataframes and the treatment of datetime data within the `quantile` function, leading to a ValueError from the `_concat._concat_compat` function.

To fix this bug, the handling of empty dataframes and datetime data within the `DataFrame.quantile` method needs to be reviewed and potentially revised.

Here is the corrected version of the `DataFrame.quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    (Rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    if data.empty:
        return data

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, an additional condition is added to check if the dataframe is empty and directly return the empty dataframe in such cases, preventing further operations in case of empty data. This should resolve the issue with empty data causing a ValueError.
