The bug is likely caused by the `_check_percentile` method, which is not defined in the provided code, so it's unclear how it would affect the algorithm. Additionally, the logic of handling the `data` and the `result` variable assignments seems to be incorrect based on the provided runtime input/output variable values. 

To fix this bug, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    
    if axis in [1, 'columns']:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)
    
    if axis in [1, 'columns']:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

This revised code simplifies the logic to handle the transposition of the data based on the `axis` parameter and uses the built-in `quantile` method to calculate the result. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` passes.
