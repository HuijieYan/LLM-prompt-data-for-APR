The bug occurs in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library. Upon analysis of the provided source code and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug leads to incorrect handling of datetime data in the `quantile` method of a DataFrame object.

The cause of the bug is that the `_constructor_sliced` method used inside the `quantile` method returns incorrect results when processed on datetime data. This leads to the ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate" error. This situation emerges when the quantile function is called on datetime data.

One suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be improving the logic to handle datetime data appropriately within the `quantile` method. Ensuring that the `_constructor_sliced` method works correctly with datetime data will resolve the bug.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` method for the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Existing body of function

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=data.columns, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we used the `_constructor` method with modified index and column arguments to create a new DataFrame when `result` has a single dimension. This ensures that the correct results are returned for datetime data as well, without raising a "need at least one array to concatenate" error.

By using the corrected version, the bug in the `quantile` method for the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library will be resolved.
