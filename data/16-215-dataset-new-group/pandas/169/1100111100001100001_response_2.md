Based on the provided input and output values, it appears that the bug in the `quantile` function is related to the handling of the `self._check_percentile(q)` call, as well as the creation of the `result` variable and its subsequent transformation. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the `self._check_percentile(q)` call, leading to the incorrect calculation of the `result` and ultimately the return value.

To fix this bug, the `self._check_percentile(q)` call should be reviewed and potentially refactored to ensure it correctly handles the input quantile values. Additionally, the creation and transformation of the `result` variable should be reviewed to ensure that it accurately calculates the quantile values based on the input parameters.

Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """
    # Perform the percentile check
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the `_check_percentile` call is retained, and the calculation of the `result` variable is simplified to directly use the `data.quantile` method. This should resolve the bug and provide the correct quantile calculations.
