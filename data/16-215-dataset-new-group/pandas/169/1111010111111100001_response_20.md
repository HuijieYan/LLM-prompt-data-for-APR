From the provided failing tests, we can see that the quantile function in the DataFrame class is failing to produce the expected output. The error message indicates a ValueError when trying to concatenate empty arrays. This suggests that the quantile function is not handling empty DataFrames correctly, which causes the failure.

The runtime input/output values indicate that the "data" variable, which should contain the numeric data of the DataFrame, is verifying as an empty DataFrame. This is likely due to the "numeric_only" parameter being set to True, and the input DataFrame contains non-numeric data (dates in this case), which should not be handled as numeric data for quantile calculations.

To fix this bug, we should modify the "data" variable such that it correctly handles numeric and non-numeric data based on the "numeric_only" parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the quantile function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the "select_dtypes" method is used to filter the DataFrame columns based on the data type. If "numeric_only" is True, it selects only columns with numeric data types, and if False, it selects all columns. This ensures that the "data" variable contains the appropriate data for quantile calculations, and the function should now pass the failing tests.
