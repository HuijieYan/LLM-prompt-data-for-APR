The potential error in the buggy function is that the method `self._check_percentile(q)` is causing the bug. The `_check_percentile` method is being called on a `DataFrame` object, but this method does not exist in the `DataFrame` class.

To fix the bug, the `_check_percentile` method should be moved to the correct class or removed if it is not needed. Since the method `self._check_percentile(q)` is the only place where the `_check_percentile` method is used and its purpose is to check the value of `q`, it can simply be replaced with an instance check of the value of `q`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    value_to_check = q if isinstance(q, (float, int, list)) else 0.5
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
