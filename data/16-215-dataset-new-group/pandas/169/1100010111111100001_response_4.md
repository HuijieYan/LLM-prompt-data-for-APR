The bug in the `quantile` function arises due to incorrect handling of an empty DataFrame. When an empty DataFrame is passed into the function, it returns an incorrect result.

The main problem is that the `quantile` function does not handle the case when the DataFrame is empty. This results in invalid computations and raises a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the `quantile` function and return an appropriate result to handle this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        return self.copy()

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this modification, all failing tests related to the `quantile` function should pass.
