The bug in the `quantile` function is caused by the logic related to transposing the DataFrames and slicing the result. The `is_transposed` variable is used to check if the data should be transposed, but this logic is incorrect, resulting in unexpected behavior and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic related to transposing the DataFrame and handling the result.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    result = data.quantile(q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we are calling the `quantile` method on the `data` DataFrame directly, which handles the transposition and result slicing internally based on the input and axis. This should resolve the issues with the failing test cases and provide the expected results.
