The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `_check_percentile` method call in the `quantile` function might be causing issues if not implemented correctly.
2. The `self._get_numeric_data()` call to filter numeric data might not be working as intended.
3. The `self._constructor` and `self._constructor_sliced` calls might not be handling the result correctly.

The cause of the bug might be related to incorrect handling of data types or the results during quantile calculation. It could also be related to the transposition of data, if the condition `is_transposed` is not handled properly.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve:
1. Ensuring that the `_check_percentile` method verifies the correctness of the percentile values.
2. Reviewing and potentially refactoring the `_get_numeric_data` method to filter numeric data correctly.
3. Verifying the correctness of the `self._constructor` and `self._constructor_sliced` calls to handle the quantile calculation results appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        self._check_percentile(q)

        data = self._get_numeric_data().select_dtypes(include=[np.number]) if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        
        if not isinstance(data, DataFrame):
            data = data.to_frame()
        
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

        return result
```

In this corrected version, the `quantile` function uses the `select_dtypes` method to ensure that only numeric data is used for quantile calculation. It simplifies the implementation to use the `DataFrame.quantile` method directly, which should handle the quantile calculation and transposition of data automatically. This eliminates the need for direct data manipulation and result handling.
