The buggy function `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file has some issues. It is calling functions that are not defined within the class, such as `_check_percentile` and `_get_numeric_data`. Additionally, it has some undefined attribute and method calls such as `self._constructor`, `self._constructor_sliced`, and `self._get_axis_number`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to call methods and attributes that do not exist within the `DataFrame` class, leading to AttributeErrors and NameErrors.

To fix the bug, the function should use the appropriate methods and attributes that are part of the `DataFrame` class. Additionally, handle the input arguments properly within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
            Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
        axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
            Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
        numeric_only : bool, default True
            If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
            computed as well.
                interpolation: {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
                This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
                when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

                * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
                fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
                * lower: `i`.
                * higher: `j`.
                * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
                * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

                Returns
                -------
                Series or DataFrame

                If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
                  index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
                  values are the quantiles.
                If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
                  index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
        """
        result = self.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q))
        return result
