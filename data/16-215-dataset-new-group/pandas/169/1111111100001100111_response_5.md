The bug is occurring because the `_get_numeric_data` method returns an empty DataFrame for datetime data, leading to issues in the quantile calculation. This causes the bug when trying to apply `quantile` to a DataFrame containing datetime data.

Based on the provided information, the bug is clearly present in the `DataFrame.quantile` method due to issues with how datetime data is handled. To fix this bug, it's necessary to modify the logic within the `quantile` method to handle datetime data appropriately.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the logic within the `quantile` method to accurately handle the quantile calculation when dealing with datetime data and properly construct the result in the DataFrame. This involves addressing the discrepancy between how the `quantile` method handles Series and DataFrame objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()
    if not numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data(datetime=True)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 1:
        result = Series(result, index=self.columns)
    else:
        result = DataFrame(result, columns=q, index=self.columns)

    return result
```

By updating the logic to retrieve numeric and datetime data appropriately and constructing the result based on the input data type, this corrected version should address the issues with the `quantile` method when working with datetime data.
