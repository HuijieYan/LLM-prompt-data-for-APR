The bug is likely occurring in the `_constructor` method that the `DataFrame` class inherits from the `NDFrame` class. Additionally, the `quantile` method from the same class could be adding complexity to the bug. 

The bug can be caused by incorrect handling of datetime data or failing to account for empty columns, leading to errors during concatenation or transposing.

To fix the bug:

1. Check the `_constructor` and `quantile` methods in both the `NDFrame` and `DataFrame` classes, as well as other relevant methods.
2. Ensure that datetime data is handled correctly and that empty columns are appropriately accounted for in the quantile calculation.
3. Verify that the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class does not have any conflicting logic that could contribute to the bug.
4. Test the quantile operation with empty and datetime data to ensure that it works as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
