The bug in the `quantile` function seems to stem from how the `data` and `result` variables are being handled. 

It appears that in both Case 1 and Case 2, the `data` variable is being assigned an empty DataFrame, and there is an issue with transposing the data. Additionally, the `result` variable is being constructed using incorrect data.

To fix the bug, we should first ensure that the correct data is being used, and that the logic for transposing the data is correct. We should also verify the creation of the `result` variable to ensure it matches the expected output format.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result_index = pd.Index(q, name='Quantile')
        result_columns = data.columns
    else:
        result_index = data.columns
        result_columns = pd.Index([q], name='Quantile')

    result = pd.DataFrame(index=result_index, columns=result_columns)

    for col in result.columns:
        result[col] = data[col].quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with transposing the data and constructing the `result` variable. It correctly handles the case when `q` is a list, and constructs the `result` DataFrame accordingly, ensuring the correct output format.
