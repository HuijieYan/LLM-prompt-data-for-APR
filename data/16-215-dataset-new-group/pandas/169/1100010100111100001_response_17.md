The bug in the function `quantile` of the `pandas/core/frame.py` file is caused by a ValueError while attempting to concatenate an empty array.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the case where there are no numeric columns to calculate the quantile of. This results in an empty DataFrame and further processing fails due to that.

To fix this bug, the function needs to include a branch to handle the case where there are no numeric columns. This branch should return an empty Series or DataFrame with the appropriate index and column names when `q` is a single value or a list, respectively.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()
    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return self._constructor(index=q, columns=self.columns, data=None)
        else:
            return self._constructor_sliced(data=None, index=self.columns, name=q)
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes a check for an empty DataFrame, and handles it appropriately by returning an empty DataFrame or Series based on the type of `q`. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
