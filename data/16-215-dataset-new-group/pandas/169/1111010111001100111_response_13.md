## The buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue

The buggy function `quantile` is a method of the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` is testing the behavior of the `quantile` method for a DataFrame containing datetime data. The failing test is intended to check the behavior of the method when the DataFrame contains no columns.

The bug occurs in the behavior of the `quantile` method when the DataFrame contains no columns, and the input data is of type datetime. The `quantile` method throws a `ValueError` indicating the need for at least one array to concatenate.

In both the failed test case and the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when using the `quantile` method on a DataFrame with a single-column containing datetime-like data.

The input/output values and types for the runtime cases indicate that the bug manifests when trying to transpose the DataFrame when there are no columns, leading to an empty DataFrame. 

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between the `quantile` method for a Series and for a DataFrame and expects the DataFrame to behave like a Series in this case.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be resolved by modifying the behavior of the `quantile` method when the DataFrame contains only one column. Instead of attempting to transpose the DataFrame, the method should return the appropriate Series-like output directly.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    if len(data.columns) == 1:
        result = data._get_item_cache(axis=1)
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
    
        result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
    
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version of the function, a conditional block is added to handle the case when the DataFrame contains only one column. In this case, the output will be a Series-like object directly obtained from the DataFrame without transposing.
