To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle quantiles with datetime or timedelta data in the same way it does for numeric data. The error occurs when trying to concatenate the quantile values because the original DataFrame, when filtered for numerical data, returns an empty DataFrame. This leads to the error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate."

The concatenated values are also computed using the `_data` attribute, so any modifications to return the correct quantile values and format need to be made in the quantile method and the `BlockManager` class in the pandas code base. Hence we should modify the logic that filters `numeric_only` to account for datetime and timedelta data and compute the correct quantile.

To fix the bug, we need to update the quantile method to consider whether `numeric_only` is True or False and handle datetime and timedelta data appropriately. This can be done by including logic to handle datetime and timedelta data as well when `numeric_only` is set to False. The modifications can be made directly to the pandas code base.

Here is the corrected version of the method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The modifications in this corrected method address the issues with datetime and timedelta data and should resolve the problems with calculating quantiles for such data types.
