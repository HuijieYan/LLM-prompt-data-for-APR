The issue seems to be with the `_get_numeric_data` function which is not returning the expected data, resulting in empty DataFrames and incorrect calculations. 

It seems that the `_get_numeric_data` function is not functioning as expected, which is causing the bug in the `quantile` function. It should return the numeric data from the DataFrame, but in the runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return, it is returning empty DataFrames and BlockManagers.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to review and potentially rewrite the `_get_numeric_data` function to ensure it correctly extracts the numeric data from the DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """
    if not numeric_only:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include='number')

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we replaced the call to `_get_numeric_data()` with `self.select_dtypes(include='number')` to explicitly select the numeric data from the DataFrame. This should ensure that the correct data is used for calculating the quantiles.
