In the provided code, the function `quantile` of the `DataFrame` class has a bug where it triggers a `ValueError`. The function attempts to use `internal.managers` to calculate quantiles and concatenate the results, but it doesn't handle empty data or data with non-numeric types correctly, leading to the `ValueError`. This issue has been reported on GitHub as "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data".

The trigger for the bug is the attempt to calculate the quantiles for a DataFrame with datetime data.

To resolve this bug, the `quantile` function must be updated to handle the case of empty or non-numeric data correctly. The logic for determining the nature of the input data should be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._select_data_to_compute_quantile(numeric_only)
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The above correction uses the new internal method `_select_data_to_compute_quantile` to handle the selection and validation of data to avoid the discrepancy caused by date and non-numeric data types.

This corrected function should successfully handle the cases where the previous version failed, thus resolving the bug.
