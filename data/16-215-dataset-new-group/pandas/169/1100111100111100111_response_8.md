The issue appears to be that the `quantile` function is not handling datetime data correctly when called on a DataFrame. The problem seems to be with the data handling process inside the function, particularly when processing datetime data. This can be seen in the GitHub issue where calling `quantile` on a Series with datetime data works fine, but when called on a DataFrame with datetime data, it raises a ValueError.

Looking at the runtime input/output values for the buggy function, we can see that the `data` variable, derived from `self._get_numeric_data()`, is an empty DataFrame in both cases. This occurs even when the input DataFrame contains datetime values.

The cause of the bug seems to be the `_get_numeric_data()` method. It is expected that this method should filter the DataFrame to contain only numeric data, but in the case of datetime data, it should also be considered as numeric for computing quantiles. The bug is likely to be in the data type handling logic within the `_get_numeric_data()` method.

A strategy to fix this bug would involve modifying the `_get_numeric_data()` method to include datetime data as numeric for quantile computations. Additionally, an error in the data handling logic inside the `quantile()` function should also be corrected to handle the transposed data appropriately and not return an empty DataFrame.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

        ...

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame

        ...
        """
        self._check_percentile(q)

        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number, np.datetime64])
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            return result
        else:
            return result.squeeze()

```

In the corrected version, the `select_dtypes()` function is used to filter the DataFrame for columns of numeric and datetime types. This ensures that datetime data is considered as numeric for quantile computations. Additionally, the `result` handling logic, especially for transposed data, has been improved to return the appropriate results.
