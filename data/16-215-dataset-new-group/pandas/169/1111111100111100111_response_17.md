The issue with the `DataFrame.quantile` function is that it is not correctly handling DataFrames with date-time columns. This is leading to a `ValueError` when trying to calculate the quantile.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are likely in the logic related to handling datetime (time period) data in the `quantile` function.

The cause of this bug is due to the incorrect handling of datetime and timedelta data when calculating the quantile. The specific error message states "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate", which is indicative of an issue with concatenating datetime arrays.

A strategy for fixing this bug would be to update the logic in the `quantile` function to handle datetime and timedelta data correctly.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (function description remains the same) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        # Include datetime and timedelta data as well
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    # Create a DataFrame from the result if ndim is 2
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(data=result, index=q, columns=self.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding logic to include datetime and timedelta data as well in the quantile calculations, the corrected function should now handle DataFrames with date-time columns correctly. This will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.
