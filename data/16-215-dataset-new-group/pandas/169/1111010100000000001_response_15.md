The buggy function is the "quantile" function within the DataFrame class. The function is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Incorrect usage of the "qs" parameter for the "quantile" function.
2. Incorrect manipulation of the "data" based on the "is_transposed" variable.
3. Inconsistent handling of the "result" variable based on its dimensions.

The cause of the bug is due to incorrect implementation of the "qs" parameter and the improper handling of transposed data.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Correct usage of the "qs" parameter within the "quantile" function.
2. Proper manipulation of the "data" based on the "is_transposed" variable.
3. Consistent handling of the "result" variable based on its dimensions.

Here is the corrected version of the "quantile" function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(q, list):  # Check if q is a list
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q, index=data.columns)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this version, the "quantile" function has been corrected to properly handle the "qs" parameter and the manipulation of the "data" based on the "is_transposed" variable. Additionally, it ensures consistent handling of the "result" variable based on its dimensions.
