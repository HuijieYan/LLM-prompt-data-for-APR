The bug in the `quantile` method is causing the failing test, where the DataFrame fails to return the expected result. The error message indicates that the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` is occurring while trying to concatenate the data. This points to a potential bug in the `quantile` method related to the DataFrame not returning the expected output for quantile function over datetime data.

The issue is raised due to the incorrect handling of datetime and timedelta data in the `quantile` method, causing it to fail.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` function needs to be corrected to handle datetime and timedelta data appropriately while computing the quantile.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    ...
    data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=result.columns)
    else:
        return self._constructor_sliced(result, index=result.index, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this version, the use of `_get_numeric_data()` is replaced with `select_dtypes(include=[np.number])` to correctly handle numeric data. The `axis` alignment is also adjusted, and the result is returned according to whether `is_transposed` is `True` or `False`. Additionally, `self._constructor()` and `self._constructor_sliced()` are used to correctly construct the output. With these changes, the `quantile` method should now handle datetime and timedelta data correctly, returning the expected output for the failing test case and resolving the GitHub issue.
