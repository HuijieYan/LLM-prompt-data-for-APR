The bug in the current function `quantile` is resulting in incorrect values for the variables `data`, `is_transposed`, `cols`, and `data._data` due to improper handling of the transposed data. 

The issue lies in the conditional logic, causing unexpected results. The code incorrectly transposes the data when the `is_transposed` variable would only be true if `axis` is set to 1. Since the original data structure already satisfies the given conditions, the unnecessary transposing causes the problem.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional logic logic to properly handle the transposed data. The corrected version of the function implementation is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=(axis == 1)
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the `axis` variable is directly used to determine if the transposition is needed, instead of using a separate `is_transposed` variable. This ensures that the correct operations are applied based on the given axis, resolving the bug.
