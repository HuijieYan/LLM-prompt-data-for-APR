## Explaining the Bug
The bug occurs in the `DataFrame.quantile` function when it is called with datetime data. This results in the concatenation error which is triggered by the internal quantile function. The issue has been reported on the GitHub repository and it's related to the fact that the DataFrame.quantile does not behave consistently with the Series.quantile when handling datetime data.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Based on the failing test and the error message, the issue is related to the concatenation error and how it is handling datetime data. The function needs to be modified to handle datetime data without triggering a concatenation error, and it should return results consistently with the Series.quantile. 

The corrected code should be designed to handle datetime data properly and return results in the expected format, to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository.

## The Corrected Code
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if isinstance(self.iloc[0], (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
        # If the first element of the DataFrame is a datetime type
        # we simply apply the quantile function to each column independently
        return self.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation), axis=0)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code makes use of conditional logic to properly handle datetime data. If the first element of the DataFrame is a datetime type, it applies the quantile function to each column independently. This ensures consistent behavior with the Series.quantile and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
