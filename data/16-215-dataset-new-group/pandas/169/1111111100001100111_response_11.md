Based on the GitHub issue and the provided runtime values, it appears that there is an issue when applying the `quantile` method to a DataFrame containing a datetime column. The issue seems to be related to the concatenation of arrays within the `quantile` method. This leads to a ValueError when attempting to return the quantile value, which causes the bug. 

The cause of this bug is likely due to the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` method. When the method is applied to a DataFrame with datetime data, it encounters an issue with the concatenation of arrays during the quantile computation.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to modify the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` method to ensure that it correctly handles the concatenation of arrays, specifically with respect to datetime data.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    elif isinstance(result, Series):
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
        return result

    return result
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to determine if the result of the quantile computation is an instance of Series. If so, the method returns the result without further processing. This check ensures that the handling of the quantile computation with datetime data is correct and addresses the concatenation issue that causes the bug.
