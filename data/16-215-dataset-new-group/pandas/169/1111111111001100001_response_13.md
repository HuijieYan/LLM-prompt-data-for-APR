The bug in the provided function is due to a faulty implementation of the quantile calculation, resulting in incorrect return values.

The core issue seems to be with the handling of empty DataFrames and the application of quantile calculations on them. This is evident from the runtime values and types of the variables right before the buggy function's return, where the values are completely empty, leading to incorrect computation.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to add a check for empty DataFrames at the beginning of the function and handle them appropriately. This could involve returning either an empty DataFrame or Series based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            return pd.Series([], index=self.columns, name=q)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the check for empty DataFrames and returning appropriate empty Series or DataFrames, we can ensure that the function handles these cases correctly and passes the failing test.
