Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the bug in the `quantile` function is causing issues with datetime data. Specifically, the issue arises when attempting to calculate the quantile on DataFrame containing datetime data, leading to errors related to "need at least one array to concatenate."

Potential cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be rooted in the `_get_numeric_data()` implementation within the `quantile` function. When `numeric_only` is set to `True`, the function attempts to identify numeric data and use it for computation. However, this process may not handle datetime data correctly, leading to the ValueError during calculation.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
The function should be updated to appropriately handle datetime and numeric data. One approach could involve checking the data types in the DataFrame and distinguishing between numeric and datetime data. Numeric data should then be used for computation, while datetime data should be appropriately ignored or handled differently.

Corrected version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ...
        
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    numeric_data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    if not numeric_only:
        numeric_data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        numeric_data = numeric_data.T

    result = numeric_data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the updated function, we explicitly check for numeric data with `self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])` and handle the `numeric_only` flag accordingly. This should allow for appropriate handling of datetime data and numeric data separately, resolving the issue identified in the failing test and GitHub issue.
