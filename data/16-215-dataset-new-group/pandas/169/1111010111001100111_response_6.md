To fix the bug in the `quantile` function, we need to address the issue with datetime type data not being handled correctly. The issue reported on GitHub provides some insight into this, indicating that the DataFrame `quantile` method is not returning the expected result for datetime data when compared to the Series `quantile` method.

The problem lies in the `quantile` function's inability to handle datetime and timedelta data correctly. The failure of the provided test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` demonstrates this issue when datetime data is included within a DataFrame.

To address this issue, we need to modify the implementation of the `quantile` function to ensure that it can handle datetime and timedelta data accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    
    if data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime64']).empty:
        data = data._get_numeric_data()
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if the DataFrame includes datetime data. If it does, we extract the numeric data. This change addresses the issue with datetime data not being handled correctly in the original implementation. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
