The issue with the buggy function seems to be with the data manipulation within the function, specifically with the data transformation, result initialization, and dimension handling. The runtime input values and types are accurate, indicating the problem lies within the function's implementation.

The main cause of the bug is the mishandling of the dataframe operations and the resulting dimensions of the output dataframe. The function is not correctly handling the case where all columns are dropped during the `quantile` calculation, leading to unexpected results and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check for empty data frames and handle them appropriately when calculating the quantile. Additionally, the return type also needs to be handled based on the input, whether it's a float or a list.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:  # check for empty dataframe
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return self._constructor_sliced(None, name=q[0])
        else:
            return pd.Series([], name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes a check for empty data frames and handles the return type based on the input. The function should now pass the failing test cases.
