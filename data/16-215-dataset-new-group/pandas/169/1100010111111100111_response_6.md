The issue with the `quantile` function appears to be related to the handling of datetime data. The failing test, `test_quantile_empty_no_columns`, aims to test the behavior of `df.quantile(0.5)` and `df.quantile([0.5])` on a DataFrame with datetime data. The error message indicates that the function is trying to concatenate empty arrays, resulting in a ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate".

The failing test data is a DataFrame with columns named "captain tightpants" and datetime data. The `quantile` function is invoked with a `q` value of 0.5 for both the DataFrame and a list containing 0.5.

The problematic area in the function seems to be the handling of datetime data, which leads to empty arrays being concatenated. This can be seen from the variables' types and values observed during runtime.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` function should be updated to handle datetime data appropriately, ensuring that empty arrays are not encountered. The correction may involve modifying how the `_get_numeric_data()` method is used for the input data.

Here's a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    data = self if numeric_only else self.select_dtypes(include=['number', 'datetime'])
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data.quantile(q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected function ensures that the appropriate data is selected based on the `numeric_only` parameter and that the quantile calculation is performed only on the necessary data types. This should address the issue with datetime data and prevent empty arrays from being concatenated, resolving the problem described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
