The bug in the `quantile` function is caused by incorrect handling of date-type data in the DataFrame, causing the function to raise a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. The bug is reflected in the failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` file. The issue is also documented on GitHub in the `DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data` with the expectation that the DataFrame should return just as the Series does when calling the `quantile` method.

The error is due to the incorrect logic of handling date-type data inside the `quantile` function when the `axis` parameter is set to 0 (representing rows). The function tries to transpose the DataFrame, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` function should be modified to handle date-type data correctly and not transpose the DataFrame in this scenario. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # Ensure the axis number is within valid range (0 or 1)
    if axis not in [0, 1]:
        raise ValueError("Axis must be 0 or 1")

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

With this corrected version, the issues related to the incorrect handling of date-type data and transposition of the DataFrame should be resolved, and the failing test should pass as expected. This would also resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect behavior of `DataFrame.quantile` with date-type data.
