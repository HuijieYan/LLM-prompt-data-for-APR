The potential error locations within the buggy function may include:

1. Incorrectly applying the `self._check_percentile(q)` method without defining it.
2. Inadequate handling of the "numeric_only" parameter which may lead to incorrect calculation of quantiles.
3. Issues with the transposition of data when "axis" is set to 1.
4. Uncertainty around the dimensionality of the result and inconsistencies in constructing the result.

The cause of the bug is that the function may not be correctly handling the quantile calculation, especially when dealing with transposed data or when the "numeric_only" parameter is set to False.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be applied:
1. Define the `_check_percentile` method properly if it is not already defined.
2. Ensure that the "numeric_only" parameter is correctly handled to include all necessary data types.
3. Verify and adjust the handling of transposed data to ensure accurate quantile calculations.
4. Review the logic for constructing the result based on its dimensionality and whether transposition is involved.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """
    # Check if q is a valid percentile
    if isinstance(q, (int, float)) and 0 <= q <= 1:
        q = [q]
    elif isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        if all(0 <= val <= 1 for val in q):
            pass
        else:
            raise ValueError("Percentiles should all be in the range [0, 1]")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Percentiles should be a float or an array-like with values in the range [0, 1]")

    data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
        result = result.transpose() if is_transposed else result
    else:  # Series
        result = result.to_frame().T if is_transposed else result

    return result
```
