## Analysis
The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The function aims to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` when trying to concatenate arrays, and the specific error message suggests that there are no arrays to concatenate.

## Bug in the Code
The bug in the code seems to be caused by a concatenation error within the `_data.quantile` method, which subsequently leads to a `ValueError` due to an attempt to concatenate empty arrays.

## Suggested Strategy
A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to add a check to verify that there is at least one array to concatenate before attempting the concatenation. Additionally, potential reasons for the absence of arrays could be related to the input DataFrame or the calculation method, so those aspects should also be examined.

## The corrected version
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Check if there is at least one array to concatenate
    if not data._data.empty:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
    else:
        raise ValueError('No data available for quantile calculation')
```

This modified version adds a check to ensure that there is at least one array to concatenate before proceeding with the quantile calculation. If the `data._data` is found to be empty, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. This check mitigates the issue of attempting to concatenate empty arrays and addresses the bug.
