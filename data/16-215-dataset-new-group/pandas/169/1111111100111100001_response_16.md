The bug seems to be related to the DataFrame being empty, which leads to an error when trying to calculate the quantile. The error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" confirms this.

The function is meant to calculate the quantile of the DataFrame, but in the failing test cases, the DataFrame is empty. This results in the subsequent operations failing due to the lack of data to work with.

To fix the bug, we should add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where the DataFrame is empty. We can return an appropriate value (e.g., another empty DataFrame) or raise an exception to indicate that the operation cannot be performed on an empty DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    """
    if len(self) == 0 or len(self.columns) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate quantile on an empty DataFrame")
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the check for an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the function, we ensure that the subsequent operations are not performed when the DataFrame does not contain any data. This should resolve the ValueError and make the function handle empty DataFrames gracefully.
