The code snippet provided contains a buggy function `quantile` inside the `DataFrame` class which returns incorrect results, mainly when the input DataFrame contains datetime data. This behavior is deviating from the expected output and has already been reported as a GitHub issue titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data".

Upon analyzing the runtime values of the input parameters and variables, it's observed that the issue arises due to incorrect handling of datetime data in the quantile function. The `quantile` method from the pandas `DataFrame` class calls the internal method `quantile` on the BlockManager, which in turn calls the concatenation method. This issue specifically occurs when working with datetime data in the input `DataFrame`.

To fix this issue, a proposed strategy would involve handling the datetime data appropriately and ensuring that the concatenation method is capable of handling datetime data.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    result = self.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation), axis=axis)

    return result
```

This updated version switches the internal calls to take advantage of the apply method, which will handle the datetime data appropriately when calculating the quantiles, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
