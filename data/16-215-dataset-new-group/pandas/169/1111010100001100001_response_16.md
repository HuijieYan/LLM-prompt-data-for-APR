Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the variables before the function's return, it seems that the issue is with the `_get_numeric_data()` method. This method is supposed to return a DataFrame containing only the numeric data from the original DataFrame, but in the provided cases, it returns an empty DataFrame.

This results in `data` being an empty DataFrame and causes issues in the subsequent operations, ultimately leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this bug, the `_get_numeric_data()` method needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it correctly returns the expected numeric data from the original DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the bug function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Get the numeric data based on the numeric_only parameter
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the `data` is directly used for the `quantile()` computation based on the `numeric_only` parameter, eliminating the need to check for transposed data and manipulating the result. If the `_get_numeric_data()` method is fixed to return the correct numeric data, this modified function will work as expected.
