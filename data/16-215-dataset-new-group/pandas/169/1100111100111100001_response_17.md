The source of the bug in the provided function is that it tries to concatenate empty arrays, which raises a ValueError. This issue arises when the function `_constructor_sliced` is called, and `result` is checked for its `ndim` attribute and used to instantiate a new DataFrame or Series. The problem occurs because `_constructor_sliced` returns itself, leading to an empty array.

To resolve this issue, a fix can be implemented by replacing the conditional statement that checks the `ndim` attribute with a simple check for whether `result` contains any elements. If not, the function should return an empty DataFrame or Series based on the type of the input.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    """
    # existing code
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    
    if result.size == 0:  # Check if result is empty
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            return self._constructor_empty(result, index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            return self._constructor_empty(result, index=self.columns, name=q)
    else:
        if result.ndim == 2:
            return self._constructor(result)
        else:
            return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    # existing code
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle empty results and return an empty DataFrame or Series.
