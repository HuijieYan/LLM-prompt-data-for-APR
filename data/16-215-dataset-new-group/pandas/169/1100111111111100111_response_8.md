The problem with the buggy function `quantile` in `pandas/core/frame.py` is that it is trying to access data that does not exist, resulting in a ValueError. The issue occurs when quantile is used with a DataFrame containing datetime data. The function is unable to handle datetime data and fails because it does not have the necessary logic for that data type.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `quantile` function to correctly handle datetime data in the input DataFrame and return the expected output. We need to ensure that the function can compute the quantile of date and time data as well.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
# Updated version of the buggy function
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(data, DataFrame) and data._is_datelike_mixed_type:
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed, datetime=True)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a conditional block that checks for datetime data in the input DataFrame. If the DataFrame contains datetime data, the `quantile` method uses the `datetime` parameter to tell the internal BlockManager to account for datetime types when computing the quantiles. Otherwise, it performs the default action.

With this fix, the `quantile` function should now be able to handle datetime data correctly and return the expected output as stated in the GitHub issue.

By making these changes, we are ensuring that the `quantile` function is updated to handle datetime data appropriately, fixing the bug and resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
