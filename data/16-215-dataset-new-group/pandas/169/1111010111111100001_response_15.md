To fix the bug, we need to correct the `_check_percentile` method in the DataFrame class that is being called inside the `quantile` method, and then update the implementation of the `quantile` method.

The `_check_percentile` method is not provided in the code, but from the error message and code execution, it's clear that the issue is related to the percentiles (`q` parameter) causing an empty DataFrame or Series. This indicates a problem with how the percentiles are being handled in the `quantile` method.

The issue seems to be in the return phase of the function, where the formatting or construction of the resulting DataFrame or Series is incorrect when an empty DataFrame is obtained from the input. 

Given this analysis, the following corrected version of the `quantile` method ensures that the percentiles are handled properly to avoid an empty DataFrame or Series:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.size > 0:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            result = self._constructor(result, index=q)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    
        return result
    else:
        return pd.DataFrame()
```
This corrected version addresses the proper handling of percentiles and returns an empty DataFrame when no data is returned from the input.
