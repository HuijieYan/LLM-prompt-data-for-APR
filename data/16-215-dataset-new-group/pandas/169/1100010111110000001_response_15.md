There are a few potential error locations in the buggy function. One possible source of the error is the `_check_percentile(q)` method call, which may be causing issues with the input `q`. Another potential source is the instantiation of the `result` variable and the subsequent conditional statements that manipulate its dimensions. Additionally, the use of the `_constructor` and `_constructor_sliced` methods may be contributing to the issue.

The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is attempting to generate quantiles from an empty DataFrame containing only dates, and it expects an empty Series or DataFrame as the result. However, the current buggy function is producing a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error when attempting to compute the quantile.

To fix the bug, it will be necessary to handle the case when the input DataFrame has no numeric data, and ensure that the quantile computation behaves as expected in this scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    # (unchanged)

    Returns
    -------
    # (unchanged)

    Examples
    --------
    # (unchanged)
    """
    # Handle case when input dataframe has no numeric data
    if self.empty or not self._get_numeric_data().any().any():
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            return pd.Series([], name=q, dtype='float64')

    self._check_percentile(q)
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, an additional check for empty or non-numeric data has been added at the beginning of the function. If the DataFrame is empty or contains no numeric data, it returns an empty Series or DataFrame based on the type of `q`, which aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to produce the correct results for the specific scenario tested in the failing test.
