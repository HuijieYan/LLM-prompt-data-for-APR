The bug in the `quantile` function appears to be related to the data manipulation within the function. It seems that the data is not being properly handled or transformed as expected, leading to unexpected results.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the input data when trying to compute the quantile. It may be failing to properly identify the necessary numeric data for the computation, or it may be mishandling the transposition of the data when calculating the quantile.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to review the logic for identifying and extracting the numeric data, ensuring that it is correctly transposed if necessary, and accurately computing the quantile based on the input parameters.

Here's a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    if axis in (1, 'columns'):
        data = data.T

    result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation))

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.rename({val: f'{val}' for val in q})
    else:
        result = result.rename(f'{q}')

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the data manipulation and quantile computation are handled using the `apply` method, which ensures that the quantile is accurately computed for each column of the DataFrame. Additionally, the result is appropriately renamed based on the input `q` value. This should address the potential issues with mishandling the data and computing the quantile.
