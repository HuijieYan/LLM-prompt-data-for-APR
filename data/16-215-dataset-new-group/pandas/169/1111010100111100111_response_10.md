The buggy function `quantile` has a logical error that causes it to fail when the input DataFrame contains datetime data. When datetime data is provided, the function has a bug where it is unable to handle empty values correctly, leading to a ValueError because it attempts to concatenate them somewhere in its internal computations.

The cause of the bug revolves around how the function interacts with empty datetime data prior to the computation of the quantile. This error is evident from the failing test case because it provides a DataFrame of datetime values and asserts that the function should calculate the quantile correctly as it would with a Series. However, due to the bug, the function fails to handle the empty DataFrame efficiently and the subsequent computations lead to a ValueError as no arrays can be concatenated.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle empty DataFrames with datetime data before performing the quantile computation. This would most likely involve handling an empty DataFrame within the `_data` attribute, and returning a default response for such empty or non-numeric data.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    (Function documentation here.)

    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:
        # Handle empty DataFrame
        result = self._constructor(None) if isinstance(q, float) else self._constructor_sliced(None, name=q)
    else:
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```
In this corrected version, the function explicitly handles the case where the DataFrame `data` is empty. If the DataFrame is empty, the function responds with a default output. When the dataframe is not empty, the function proceeds to compute the quantile as before. This corrected behavior ensures that the function won't fail when an empty DataFrame is passed.
