The bug is likely caused by a failure to handle `datetime` and `timedelta` data when running the `quantile` function for DataFrame. The failing test with Case 1 provides evidence for this cause - when the input DataFrame contains only datetime data, the function fails to handle it and raises an error. The relevant errors and output also show that the empty DataFrame, resulting from applying `numeric_only=True`, causes issues when passing through the internal Pandas function calls.

To fix the bug, the function should handle datetime and timedelta data even when `numeric_only` is set to `True`. The function should use the `_select_data` private method to handle numeric_only and perform the quantile calculation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    ... (other function documentation remains unchanged) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    data = self._select_data(axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only)

    result = data._quantile(q, interpolation)

    result = result.T if is_transposed else result

    return result
```
In the corrected version, the function directly calls the `_select_data` method to handle numeric_only and calls the `_quantile` method of the data, followed by a check to transpose `result` if necessary. This version should handle the datetime and timedelta data as expected for quantile calculation.
