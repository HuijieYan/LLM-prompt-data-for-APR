The issue with the buggy function `quantile` is that it fails to handle quantiles for datetime data when called on a DataFrame, resulting in a ValueError. The issue is that the `quantile` function doesn't handle non-numeric data properly.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the quantile function can handle both numeric and non-numeric data correctly. We can do this by modifying the data handling logic within the function to differentiate between numeric and non-numeric data and process them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    ...

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    ...
    """

    def _quantile(series, percentile):
        try:
            return series.quantile(percentile)
        except Exception:
            return series.dropna().quantile(percentile)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    else:
        data = self

    if is_list_like(q):
        result = data.apply(_quantile, percentile=q)
    else:
        result = data.apply(_quantile, percentile=q)

    return result
```

This corrected version of the `quantile` function checks if the data should be processed as numeric-only. If so, it selects only the numeric columns. Next, it applies the `_quantile` function to each column of the DataFrame, handling both numeric and non-numeric data correctly. This should resolve the issue with quantiles for non-numeric data and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
