The issue seems to be occurring when the `DataFrame._data.quantile()` method is called. This method is likely expecting some data to be present, but it appears that no data is being passed or processed correctly.

Looking at the input parameters and the values of relevant variables right before the return, it seems that the `data` variable is an empty DataFrame, which might be causing the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` when the method tries to compute the quantile.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `data` variable contains the correct data for the quantile calculation based on the input parameters specified.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("Dataframe is empty")
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        return self._constructor(result)
    else:
        return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
```

By checking if the DataFrame is empty and raising an error in that case, we ensure that the `data` variable contains the necessary data for the calculation, thus fixing the bug. The error message returned will also point to the root cause of the issue.
