The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the manipulation of the DataFrame object and its data. The function `quantile` is intended to calculate quantiles for the data in the DataFrame, but it appears to be failing to handle the data correctly.

The problem arises when trying to access numeric data from the DataFrame. Upon examination of the runtime values and types of variables, it appears that the `data` variable becomes an empty DataFrame. This means that the function is unable to extract the numeric data from the input DataFrame, resulting in errors.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic for extracting numeric data inside the `quantile` function. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case when the DataFrame contains only non-numeric data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle cases where the DataFrame does not contain numeric data. This could involve checking the data type of the columns and ensuring that the quantile calculations are only performed on columns with numeric data. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the input `q` parameter is a list, and it should still be able to return correct results in such cases.

### Corrected Function
Here's a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include='number')
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Perform quantile calculation only if there is numeric data
    if not data.empty:
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)
        
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
        
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
        
        return result

    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected function, we first select only the columns with numeric data if `numeric_only` is set to `True`. Then, we perform the quantile calculation on the selected data. If the data is empty, we return `None` to indicate that the calculation cannot be performed. This implementation should handle the cases where the input data does not contain numeric values and ensure that the function behaves correctly when `q` is a list.
