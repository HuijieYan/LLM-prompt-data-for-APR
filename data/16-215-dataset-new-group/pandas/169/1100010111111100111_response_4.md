The issue with the `quantile` function appears to arise when working with datetime data, causing a `ValueError` with the error message "need at least one array to concatenate" to be raised. 

The bug in the function seems to be around line 8218, where the `data` object is used to compute the `result`. After this computation, the function should check if the `result` is a 2D array and construct a DataFrame if so, or a Series otherwise. It seems that with datetime data, the `data` object is empty, leading to the `ValueError` when concatenating arrays.

To resolve this issue, the function should be updated to handle cases when the `data` object is empty, such as when working with datetime data. Additionally, the conditional logic to check the dimensionality of the result should be revisited to avoid concatenation errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if len(result) == 0 or len(result[0]) == 0:
        return self._constructor(result)
    elif result.ndim == 2:
        return self._constructor(result)
    else:
        return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        return result.T
```

This corrected version of the function should handle cases when the `data` object is empty, preventing the `ValueError` from being raised. The logic to check the dimensionality of the result has also been updated to avoid concatenation errors.
