Buggy function analysis:
- The quantile function is defined within the DataFrame class, which seems to be a part of the pandas library for handling data in tabular form.

Identified errors:
- The buggy function does not correctly handle the `axis` parameter and transposing the data based on the axis. There might be an error in the logic for calculating the quantile across the specified axis.

Cause of the bug:
- The bug might be caused due to incorrect transposing of data when the `axis` is not 0, and calculation of `qs` directly against the data.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- We need to first ensure that the logic to handle `axis` is correct. Then, we should review the logic for computing quantile `qs` to ensure it works correctly in all cases.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the quantile calculation is delegated to the `data` object with the correct parameters, and we simply return the computed result.
