Looking at the failing test and the runtime input/output values for the buggy function, we can see that the problem lies in the data being modified incorrectly within the function. The variable `data` is being set to an empty DataFrame, which causes issues downstream in the function. The checked values of `data.T`, `data.columns`, and `data._data` all show that the data is consistently being set to empty.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the `data` variable is not being incorrectly modified within the function, and that the original data is being used as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    original_data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    data = original_data.copy()  # Make a copy of the original data
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we use the `original_data` as the source for processing within the function, and we create a copy of it to avoid modifying the original data. This should resolve the issue of the `data` variable being set to an empty DataFrame.
