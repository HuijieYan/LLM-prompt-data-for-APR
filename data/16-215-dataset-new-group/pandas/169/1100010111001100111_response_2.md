The bug in the `quantile` function is causing an issue where a DataFrame with datetime data raises a ValueError, while a Series with the same data works fine.

The potential error location is within the `_get_numeric_data` function, where it filters the data to only include numeric columns. This filtering may be causing DataFrame with non-numeric data, such as dates, to become empty, leading to the ValueError.

The cause of the bug is that when the DataFrame contains non-numeric data, the `self._get_numeric_data()` returns an empty DataFrame, causing issues with the quantile calculations in subsequent steps.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `self._get_numeric_data()` function to handle non-numeric data more gracefully. If the DataFrame contains non-numeric columns, the function could either be modified to exclude those columns or to handle non-numeric data in a different way that doesn't cause the subsequent quantile calculations to fail.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self.select_dtypes(include=np.number) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
        
    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = data.apply(lambda col: col.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation))
    else:
        result = data.quantile(q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The corrected version includes a modification to the way the numeric data is selected using `self.select_dtypes(include=np.number)`. This ensures that only numeric columns are included in the `data` variable, addressing the issue of empty DataFrames causing subsequent calculations to fail. Additionally, it includes a conditional statement to handle cases where `q` is a list or array of quantiles, ensuring that the calculations are performed correctly in all cases.
