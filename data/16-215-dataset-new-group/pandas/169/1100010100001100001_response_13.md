The bug in the function is likely caused by the `data._get_numeric_data()` method not returning the expected data for the quantile calculation. This results in the `result` being an empty DataFrame instead of the expected quantiles.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that the correct data is being used for quantile calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
    else:
        data = self

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we use the `select_dtypes` method to filter and get only the numeric columns in the DataFrame when `numeric_only` is True. Then, the `quantile` method is called on this filtered data, using the `q`, `axis`, and `interpolation` parameters. This ensures that the correct data is used for quantile calculation and should resolve the bug.
