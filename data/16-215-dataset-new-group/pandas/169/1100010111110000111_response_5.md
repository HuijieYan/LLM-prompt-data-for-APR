## Analysis:
The `quantile` function from the DataFrame is not handling datetime data and is returning an error when used with a DataFrame object that contains datetime columns. This is verified by the failing test and the provided error message. The corresponding GitHub issue (GH#23925) describes the problem detailedly and expects the DataFrame to behave similarly to the Series when used with the `quantile` method.

## Bug Locale:
The bug may be located in the `quantile` function's logic where datetime data is not handled properly, leading to errors during the concatenation of data arrays.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `quantile` function not considering the handling of datetime columns correctly. The `_check_percentile` function does not handle the scenario of datetime data, which leads to improper handling in the subsequent steps and causes the error related to concatenation when datetime data is involved.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `quantile` function to handle datetime columns appropriately. The `_check_percentile` function might need to check for the presence of datetime data and handle it distinctly. Additionally, the concatenation error during quantile computation needs to be debugged and resolved.

## The Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    [Rest of the function remains the same]

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    """

    data = self if numeric_only == False else self._get_numeric_data()
    if isinstance(data.iloc[0, 0], np.datetime64):
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
        result = result.convert_dtypes()
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for datetime columns before calling the `_get_numeric_data` method and then converted any datetime data to proper types using the `convert_dtypes` method. Additionally, we explicitly converted the `result` to proper types to avoid datatype-related errors.

With these changes, the `quantile` function should now handle datetime columns gracefully and resolve the bug.
