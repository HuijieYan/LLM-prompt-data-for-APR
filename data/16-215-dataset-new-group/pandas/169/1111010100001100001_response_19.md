The bug in the `quantile` function is likely due to incorrect manipulation of the data and incorrectly handling the transposed data. The function should return the quantile values for the specified axis, but based on the runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the data manipulation is not occurring correctly.

The potential error locations are:
1. Incorrect determination of whether the data needs to be transposed or not.
2. Issues with manipulating the data based on the axis.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly transpose the data if needed and compute the quantile values based on the specified axis.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result.T if is_transposed else result
```

In the corrected version, we simply call the `quantile` function on `data` and return the result after transposing it if the data was transposed initially. This should handle the quantile computation correctly for the specified axis.
