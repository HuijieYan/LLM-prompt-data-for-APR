The bug in the `quantile` function is causing an issue with the quantile calculation for datetime data in a DataFrame, as indicated in the GitHub issue "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data."

The specific problem in the `quantile` function is related to the handling of datetime data and the concatenation of arrays, as described in the GitHub issue. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` highlights this issue by demonstrating that when using a DataFrame with datetime data, the quantile function does not return the expected results and raises a ValueError, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the quantile calculation works correctly for datetime data in a DataFrame and resolves the issue outlined in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    # Check if the result is a DataFrame or Series
    if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
        result = self._constructor(result, index=result.index, columns=result.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By ensuring that the result type is correctly handled based on whether it's a DataFrame or Series, we can address the bug related to datetime data in the quantile function for a DataFrame. This corrected version should resolve the issue outlined in the GitHub report and ensure that the failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` passes as expected.
