#### Analyzing the Buggy Function and the Corresponding GitHub Issue

The buggy function is the `quantile` method, located in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. This method is used to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. However, there is a failing test associated with this function that asserts incorrect behavior when performing quantile computation with DateTime data.

The failing test, represented by the error message from the test, complains about the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. This error message is related to an issue reported on GitHub, titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data."

The issue on GitHub explains that while the `quantile` method works fine with a Series containing DateTime data, it raises a `ValueError` when used with a DataFrame containing DateTime data, which is incorrect behavior.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

The potential error locations in the buggy function are where the method attempts to compute the quantile. It seems that the issue may lie in the computation of the quantile in the presence of DateTime data or in handling the DataFrame's transposed state.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug lies in the way the DataFrame handles DateTime data when computing the quantile. It seems that the internal compatibility checks within the `quantile` method are failing, leading to the `ValueError`. This is causing incorrect behavior for the DataFrame.

### Suggesting a Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy to fix the bug involves investigating how DateTime data is handled by the `quantile` method and its internal computations. It may be necessary to optimize the method so that it appropriately handles the DateTime data and the DataFrame's transposed state when computing the quantile.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = (
        self._get_numeric_data()
        if numeric_only
        else self._get_numeric_data()
        if isinstance(self._get_numeric_data(), np.ndarray)
        else self
    )

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if axis == 0 and len(data.columns) == 0:
        return self._constructor(np.nan)

    result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

The corrected version of the function adds a check for an empty DataFrame where the columns have been dropped when calculating the quantile. If the DataFrame has an empty set of columns, the function will return `np.nan`. This fixes the issue with `ValueError` raised due to an empty DataFrame when calculating the quantile.
