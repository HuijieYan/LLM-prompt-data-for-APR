The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class, which is being used to calculate quantiles over a specified axis. Based on the provided runtime values and types of input parameters, as well as the values and types of relevant variables right before the function's return, we can identify the following potential error:

Cause of the bug:
1. The variable `data` is initialized as an empty DataFrame, indicating that the data from the input DataFrame is not being properly accessed or processed.
2. The `is_transposed` variable is consistently set to `False`, meaning that the condition for checking whether the data should be transposed is not being properly evaluated.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Verify that the `_get_numeric_data()` method, which is utilized to retrieve numeric data from the input DataFrame, is functioning correctly to ensure that the relevant data is being accessed for quantile computation.
2. Verify the logic for determining whether the data should be transposed in the quantile calculation based on the specified axis.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Determine if data needs to be transposed based on the axis
    if axis == 'index' or axis == 0:
        data = self if numeric_only else self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    else:
        data = self.T if numeric_only else self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the logic for retrieving the relevant data for quantile computation based on the specified axis and the `numeric_only` flag has been updated. Additionally, the conditional statement for transposing the data based on the axis has been revised to ensure accurate handling of the input data.
