Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue arises from the `_check_percentile` method and the data being processed in the `quantile` method. The `_check_percentile` method is likely failing to handle the empty DataFrame conditions, leading to incorrect results further down the line in the `quantile` method.

To fix the bug, we should include a condition in the `_check_percentile` method to handle edge cases such as an empty DataFrame, and also ensure that the dataframe processing in the `quantile` method handles these edge cases correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        return self

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding a condition at the beginning of the `quantile` method to check if the DataFrame is empty and returning the DataFrame itself, we can avoid further processing and returns as the rest of the method relies on the assumption that the DataFrame is not empty.
