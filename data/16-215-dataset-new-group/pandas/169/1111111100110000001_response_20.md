The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class of the `pandas` library. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised due to needing at least one array to concatenate.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the `quantile` method processes the input data and then tries to concatenate the array values. It seems that the input data is not being handled properly, leading to an empty array where the method expects valid data to concatenate.

To fix the bug, the code within the `quantile` method should be reviewed to ensure that the input data is being processed correctly and that any potential edge cases, such as an empty input, are accounted for. It's also important to verify that the data being concatenated is of the expected type and shape.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Ensure that the data is not empty
    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("Input DataFrame is empty")

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, an additional check is added to ensure that the input data is not empty. If the data is empty, a `ValueError` is raised to indicate the issue. This should prevent the error message from the failing test that indicated the need for at least one array to concatenate.
