Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies with the `self._constructor_sliced` and `self._constructor` methods. The `_constructor_sliced` method seems to be used to create a new DataFrame using the result of the quantile computation, and the `_constructor` method is used to create the new DataFrame from the computed quantiles.

The potential error location is identified in these lines:
```python
result = self._constructor(result)
else:
    result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
```

The cause of the bug seems to be in the incorrect usage of the `_constructor_sliced` and `_constructor` methods. It appears that the intention is to create a new DataFrame from the quantile results, but the usage is incorrect.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to use the correct method for constructing the new DataFrame and ensuring that the quantile computation output is used appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = DataFrame(result, index=self.index, columns=self.columns)
    else:
        result = Series(result, index=self.columns)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we use the `DataFrame` or `Series` constructor to create a new DataFrame or Series from the quantile results, depending on the dimensionality of the result. This ensures that the new object is constructed correctly and the bug is fixed.
