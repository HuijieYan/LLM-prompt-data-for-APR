The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas.core.frame` file. 

The test that is failing is `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` file. The error message from the failing test indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.

The potential error within the `quantile` method is likely related to the `concat` operation being performed to compute the quantile. This usually involves the concatenation of arrays, and the error message suggests that there are no arrays to concatenate, leading to the ValueError.

The cause of the bug is related to the logic for computing the quantile and concatenating arrays in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class. It seems that in certain cases, there are no arrays to concatenate, causing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully review the logic for computing the quantile and ensure that there are always arrays available to concatenate. One potential strategy would be to add a check for empty arrays or missing data before performing the concatenation. 

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if len(data) == 0:
        # If the data is empty, return an empty DataFrame or Series
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            return pd.DataFrame(index=q, columns=data.columns)
        else:
            return pd.Series(index=data.columns)

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version of the function, a check has been added to handle the case where the data is empty. If the data is empty, the function returns an empty DataFrame or Series depending on the type of `q` provided. This should resolve the issue of the ValueError occurring when there are no arrays to concatenate.
