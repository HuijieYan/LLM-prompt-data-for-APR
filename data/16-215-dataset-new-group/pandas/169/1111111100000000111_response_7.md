### Analysis:
The source code provided contains a class `DataFrame` with a function `quantile`. The GitHub issue relates to the function `quantile`, which is experiencing issues with datetime data.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue could be related to the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function or its related internal calculations.

### Cause of the Bug 
The cause of the bug is the improper handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function. This is leading to unexpected behavior when the function is called on a DataFrame containing datetime data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix strategy should involve implementing proper handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function. This may include changes to the internal calculations to handle datetime data accurately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Provided that the bug fix strategy involves improving datetime data handling

    # ... (previous function body)

    # Handling of datetime data
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only and self._is_numeric() else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data._is_datetime():
        # If the data contains datetime, handle it differently for quantile calculation
        result = data._data.quantile_datetime(q, interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
    else:
        # Process as numerical data
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    # ... (remaining function body)
```

This corrected function includes a conditional check to handle the situation where the data contains datetime values. This allows for specific handling of datetime data during the quantile calculation process.

By implementing this strategy, the `DataFrame` should return the expected results when `quantile` is applied to datetime data.
