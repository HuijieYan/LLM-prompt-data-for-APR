The issue appears to be related to the handling of DateTime data. The `quantile` method is called on a DataFrame containing DateTime data, and the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error is being raised.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it is observed that the `quantile` method is being called with DateTime data, and the resultant `data` DataFrame is empty. This is causing issues in the subsequent computations, resulting in the ValueError.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of DateTime data within the `quantile` method, leading to an empty DataFrame `data`. Consequently, the subsequent operations on this empty DataFrame result in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` method needs to be modified to properly handle DateTime data and ensure that the `data` DataFrame is not empty. Additionally, the concatenation and other operations need to be modified to handle DateTime values appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` method based on the analysis and proposed fix:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (other docstring remains the same)
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    # Ensure data is not empty and is of appropriate type
    if data.empty:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Get the result based on appropriate data
    if not is_transposed:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the `quantile` method ensures appropriate handling of DateTime data and avoids empty DataFrames during computations.

With this fix, the failing tests related to DateTime data in the `quantile` method should pass, resolving the GitHub issue related to DataFrame quantile functionality with DateTime data.
