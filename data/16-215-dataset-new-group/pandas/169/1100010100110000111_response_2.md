Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug in the `quantile` function is related to the handling of datetime data when quantiles are calculated. The bug causes the function to raise a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` when using the `quantile` function on a DataFrame with datetime data.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function. The function fails to handle the datetime data properly, resulting in the error when attempting to concatenate arrays. The issue posted on GitHub confirms that this bug should be resolved, and the output for DataFrames should be consistent with the output for Series.

To fix this bug, the `quantile` function should be updated to correctly handle datetime data. This can be achieved by converting any datetime data within the DataFrame to numeric format before performing the quantile calculations. Additionally, the transposition of data should be carefully handled to preserve the correct structure of the resulting DataFrame or Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._reduce(datetime_only=numeric_only)
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the data is reduced to handle datetime data properly, and the axis argument is used directly to ensure the quantile is applied correctly. The correct handling of datetime data ensures that the resulting DataFrame or Series is consistent with the output for Series as confirmed by the GitHub issue.
