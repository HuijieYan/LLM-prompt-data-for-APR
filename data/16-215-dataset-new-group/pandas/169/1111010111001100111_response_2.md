#### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug is likely a result of the `_get_numeric_data()` function called within the `quantile` method. This function should return a DataFrame with only the numeric columns, but it appears to be returning an empty DataFrame in the failing cases. There may be an issue when dealing with datetime columns and selecting only the numeric data.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic within the `_check_percentile` function, as well as potentially re-evaluating how the `self._get_numeric_data()` method retrieves the numeric data. It's possible that datetime data is not being handled correctly in the selection of numeric data, leading to an empty dataframe being returned.

Based on the error and the failing test cases, the logic for handling datetime columns or other non-numeric data should be validated and adjusted to ensure that the `quantile` method correctly selects the relevant columns for quantiles calculation.


#### Corrected Version
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """

    # Updated logic for retrieving numeric data
    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])  # Select only numeric columns
    else:
        data = self  # Use all columns including non-numeric

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, numeric_only=numeric_only)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the `quantile` method's logic for retrieving numeric data has been updated. Instead of relying solely on the `_get_numeric_data()` method, it uses the `select_dtypes` method to explicitly select numeric columns based on the `numeric_only` parameter. This should ensure that the correct numeric data is used for the quantile calculations, addressing the issue with datetime columns potentially causing empty dataframes. With these changes, the `quantile` method should now handle the calculation of quantiles correctly with both numeric and non-numeric data.
