The bug occurs because when the `quantile` function is called with an empty DataFrame, it doesn't handle the empty data correctly. This results in an error when trying to concatenate empty arrays, leading to a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, the `quantile` function should include a check for empty data and return an appropriate empty DataFrame or Series without trying to perform any calculations.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return self._constructor_sliced({}, index=q)
        else:
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
    else:
        # Rest of the original quantile function goes here
        # ...
```

This fix checks if the DataFrame is empty and returns an appropriate empty DataFrame or Series without trying to perform any calculations. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
