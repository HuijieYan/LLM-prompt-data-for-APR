From the analysis, it seems that the bug occurs when using the `quantile` function with a DataFrame that contains only datetime data. The error message indicates a concatenation error when trying to perform quantile calculations on an empty DataFrame that contains only datetime data. This issue is described in the GitHub issue titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data".

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_numeric_data` method drops all columns if there is no numeric data, resulting in an empty DataFrame. This causes the subsequent quantile computations to fail with a ValueError indicating the need for at least one array to concatenate.

To fix this bug, the `_get_numeric_data` method needs to be adjusted to handle empty DataFrames without dropping all columns, especially when the DataFrame contains only datetime data.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self.select_dtypes(include=np.number) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, a new approach to selecting numeric data is used, addressing the issue of dropping all columns when only datetime data is present. The `select_dtypes` method is used to specifically handle the selection of numeric data, and it does not drop all columns when only datetime data is present. This change resolves the bug and ensures that quantile calculations work as expected, even with datetime data.

This should address the bug and allow the `quantile` function to work properly with datetime data, as indicated in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
