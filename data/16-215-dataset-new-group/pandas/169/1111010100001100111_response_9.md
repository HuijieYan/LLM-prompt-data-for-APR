The root cause of the bug in the `quantile` function lies in the incorrect processing of datetime data when used with a DataFrame. The issue is due to the attempt to concatenate the datetime data, resulting in a ValueError. This is clearly identified in the GitHub issue titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data," where the expected output is that the DataFrame should return the quantile just as Series does.

To fix this bug, the `_get_numeric_data()` method should be used to correctly handle the datetime and timedelta data in the DataFrame. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the array-like data is appropriately handled for quantile calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self._data
    data = data._mgr.consolidate()  # Ensure that the data is consolidated before quantile calculation
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data.quantile(q=q, interpolation=interpolation, axis=axis, convert=bool(numeric_only))

    return self._constructor(result, index=q) if isinstance(q, list) else result
```

With these updates, the `quantile` function will correctly handle datetime and timedelta data within the DataFrame, avoiding the concatenation issue and producing the expected output stated in the GitHub issue.
