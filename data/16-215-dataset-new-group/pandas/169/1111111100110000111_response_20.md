The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class has an issue related to datetime data, which is not handled properly. The error message indicates that there is a problem with concatenating arrays and a value error is raised.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the `quantile` function handles datetime and timedelta data. When the DataFrame contains only datetime data and the `quantile` function is applied, it attempts to concatenate arrays but fails due to the absence of appropriate arrays.

The strategy for fixing this bug involves addressing the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function. Specifically, the function should be modified to check for the presence of datetime data before attempting to perform operations that are intended for numeric data.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the code remains the same)
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self._get_numeric_data().shape[1] == 0:
        result = self._constructor(index=self.columns)
        return result

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # the remaining logic of the function remains the same
```

By adding a conditional check to handle scenarios where there are no numeric columns in the DataFrame, we can ensure that the function does not attempt to perform operations that are reserved for numeric data (e.g., concatenating arrays for quantile calculation). This change should resolve the issue and the function should now pass the failing test.
