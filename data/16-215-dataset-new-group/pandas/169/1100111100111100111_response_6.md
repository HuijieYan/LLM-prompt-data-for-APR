The issue seems to be related to the computation of the quantile for datetime data in a DataFrame, resulting in a `ValueError` when `DataFrame.quantile()` is called. The failing test cases demonstrate that the issue is with an empty DataFrame where `.quantile()` is called without specifying a specific column or index. In such cases, the function currently tries to perform a concatenation operation where there are no arrays to concatenate, leading to the `ValueError`. 

### Bug Location
The issue seems to be located within the `_quantile` method of the `pandas.core.internals.managers.BlockManager` class, where it tries to perform a concatenation with a list of values that is empty.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug appears to be the inability of the quantile method to handle empty DataFrames when `DataFrame.quantile()` is called without specifying a specific column or index. This problem should be addressed by handling the empty DataFrame cases appropriately.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the quantile method should check for empty DataFrames before attempting any computation. If the DataFrame is empty, it should return a default or appropriate value (e.g., NaN) without performing any computations that might lead to a `ValueError`. 

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `quantile()` method should be updated to handle empty DataFrames by adding a check for the presence of data before attempting any computations. Here's the corrected version of the method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    # Check if the DataFrame is empty
    if self.empty:
        # Return an appropriate value, e.g., NaN
        return np.nan

    # Rest of the original quantile function for non-empty DataFrames
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes a check for empty DataFrames at the beginning of the function and returns an appropriate value, such as NaN, if the DataFrame is empty.
