The bug in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class in `pandas.core.frame` prevents it from returning the quantile of a DataFrame when it contains only datetime data. This issue was raised on GitHub, where the user reported that while the `quantile` method works fine with a Series containing datetime data, it raises a `ValueError` when called on a DataFrame with similar data.

Analysis:
1. The `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` test case fails while calculating the quantile for a DataFrame containing datetime data, raising a `ValueError`. The test is part of the `test_quantile.py` file in the `pandas/tests/frame` directory.

2. The error occurs in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class when trying to calculate the quantile of a DataFrame with only datetime data.

3. The GitHub issue titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" provides information about the equivalence of calling `quantile` on a Series and a DataFrame containing datetime data. It showcases the issue, including the error message raised when calling the `quantile` method on the DataFrame.

Cause of the bug:
The issue arises from the implementation of the `quantile` method not handling the case where the DataFrame contains only datetime data, leading to the ValueError during the internal DataFrame calculations.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by updating the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class to handle the case where the DataFrame contains only datetime data. A check can be added to detect this condition and handle the calculation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()  # Always get the numeric data, as it retains the datetime data
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Check if data is empty, i.e., there are no arrays to concatenate
    if len(data) == 0 or len(data.columns) == 0:
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            result = self._constructor(data, index=q, columns=data.columns)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(data, name=q)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this correction, the `quantile` method will correctly handle the edge case of calculating the quantile for a DataFrame containing only datetime data, resolving the bug and returning the expected output.

After applying the corrected `quantile` method, the failing test should pass, and the issue raised on GitHub should be resolved.
