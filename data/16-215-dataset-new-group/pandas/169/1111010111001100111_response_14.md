The bug seems to be related to the `quantile` function when applied to DataFrames containing datetime data. The failing tests reveal that the bug occurs when the function is invoked for DataFrames with datetime data, resulting in empty DataFrames with issues in concatenation.

The bug appears to be related to the `data._data.quantile` call, where it might not handle datetime data correctly, leading to incorrect results and empty DataFrames. The issue in GitHub also confirms that the bug is related to DataFrames containing datetime data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `data._data.quantile` call is handling datetime data appropriately and returning the correct results. Additionally, we should ensure that the empty DataFrames issue during the concatenation is resolved.

## Corrected Version
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (other documentation remains the same) ...
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._convert_datetime_to_numeric() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    return result
```

In the corrected version:
1. We have modified the line `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self` to `data = self._convert_datetime_to_numeric() if numeric_only else self` to ensure that datetime data is appropriately handled.
2. We removed the unnecessary `is_transposed` variable and the transpose logic since we are handling the data appropriately without transposing it.
3. We removed the logic for constructing different types of results based on dimensionality since the original bug is more related to handling the data correctly.

This corrected version of the `quantile` function should resolve the issues related to datetime data in DataFrames and ensure that it returns the correct results, passing the failing tests and addressing the GitHub issue.
