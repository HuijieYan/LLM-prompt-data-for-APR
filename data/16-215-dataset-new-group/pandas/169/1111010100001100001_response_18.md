Looking at the provided information, the buggy function `quantile` inside the `DataFrame` class of the pandas library has several issues. The main problem arises from the data not being properly processed, leading to an empty DataFrame being returned in both cases. This is due to the `_get_numeric_data()` function being used incorrectly, as well as a potential issue with how the quantile is being calculated and formatted in the return.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the data is properly selected and processed before the quantile calculation is performed. Additionally, we need to handle the case when multiple quantiles are passed as a list to ensure the correct return type.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = self.quantile(q, axis, numeric_only, interpolation)
        return result
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.apply(lambda col: col.quantile(q=q, interpolation=interpolation), axis=0)

    if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
        return result
    else:
        result.name = q
        return result
```

In this corrected version, we first handle the case when `q` is a list, and recursively call the `quantile` function for each quantile in the list. Then, we use the `apply` method to calculate the quantiles for each column of the DataFrame. If the result is a DataFrame, we return it as is, otherwise, we set the name of the Series to the quantile value and return it. This should address the issues with incorrect data processing and formatting, resulting in the correct quantile calculation and return.
