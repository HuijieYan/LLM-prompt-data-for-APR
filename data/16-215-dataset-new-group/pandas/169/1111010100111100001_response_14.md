The potential error in the `quantile` function might be related to the creation of the `data` variable. When `numeric_only` is set to True, the `_get_numeric_data()` method is called to obtain the numeric data from the DataFrame. However, the function seems to return an empty DataFrame in both cases, which is leading to the ValueError when trying to concatenate or perform operations on the resulting data.

To fix this issue, we need to review the implementation of the `_get_numeric_data()` method to ensure that it correctly identifies and retrieves the numeric data from the DataFrame. Additionally, we should revisit the logic for transposing the DataFrame, as the `is_transposed` flag is currently set to False.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self.select_dtypes(include=np.number)  # Modified to obtain only numeric data
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, interpolation=interpolation)  # Simplified call to quantile(), no need for separate handling

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return result
    else:
        return result.rename(q)
```

By modifying the `data` variable to use the `select_dtypes` method to obtain only numeric data, and simplifying the call to the `quantile()` method, we can ensure that the function returns the expected result without encountering a ValueError.

Please note that further testing and refinements may be required depending on the full functionality and requirements of the `quantile` function within the DataFrame class.
