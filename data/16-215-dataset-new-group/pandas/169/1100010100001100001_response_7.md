The bug seems to be related to the way the function handles the input parameters and the internal data manipulation. The function is designed to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis for DataFrame objects in pandas.

The bug appears to be occurring in the data manipulation steps of the function, as it fails to provide the expected output. The issue seems to be related to how the data is being transposed and manipulated.

To fix the bug, the data transposition and manipulation steps need to be reviewed and potentially revised. Additionally, the way the index and columns are handled within the data should be examined.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)
    else:
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the data manipulation and transposition steps have been simplified, and the quantile calculation is handled based on the type of the input q (float or list). This should address the potential issues with the original function.
