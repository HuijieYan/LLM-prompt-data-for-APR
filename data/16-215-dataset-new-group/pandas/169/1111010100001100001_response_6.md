Looking at the buggy function, the potential error locations are in the calculation of the quantile and in the transposition of the data. The cause of the bug is that the calculation of the quantile and the transposition of the data are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the quantile is calculated correctly and that the data is transposed and handled appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
        
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
            
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)
        
        if isinstance(q, list):
            result = result.T
        
        return result
```

In the corrected function, we are using the built-in `quantile` method of the DataFrame to calculate the quantile. We also handle the case when `q` is a list and correctly transpose the result in that case.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the correct quantile values.
