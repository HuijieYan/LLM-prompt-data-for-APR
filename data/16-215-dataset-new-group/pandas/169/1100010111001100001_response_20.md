Looking at the runtime input variables and their values, we can see that the issue lies in the `data` variable, which is initially assigned as an empty DataFrame. This is why the result is also an empty DataFrame or empty Series upon return.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `data` variable is not empty and contains the correct values from the input DataFrame. We can achieve this by adding a check to ensure that the `data` DataFrame is not empty and by selecting the numeric data only from the input DataFrame, if `numeric_only` is set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result

```

With this correction, the `data` variable is now assigned based on whether `numeric_only` is set to `True` or not, ensuring that the function correctly computes the quantiles and returns the expected results for both single and multiple quantile values.
