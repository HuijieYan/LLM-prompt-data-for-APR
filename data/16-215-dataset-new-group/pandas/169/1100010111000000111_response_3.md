Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `DataFrame.quantile` method is not working properly with datetime data. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` explicitly mentions that the method raises a `ValueError`. The GitHub issue further explains that while the equivalent `Series.quantile` method works fine with datetime data, the `DataFrame.quantile` method does not. The expected output is that the DataFrame should return a result similar to what the Series returns.

The potential error location within the `quantile` method is the handling of datetime data, specifically when the `DataFrame.quantile` method is used with datetime data. It seems that the method does not handle datetime data properly, leading to the `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, the strategy should be to update the `quantile` function to handle datetime data correctly. You should check if the data being passed to the `quantile` method is datetime data and then handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Check if the data is datetime data
    if isinstance(data, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        result = data.to_series().quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, there is an explicit check for datetime data, and in case of datetime data, the method converts the data to a Series and then computes the quantile, ensuring that it works correctly with datetime data as well as with other types of data.
