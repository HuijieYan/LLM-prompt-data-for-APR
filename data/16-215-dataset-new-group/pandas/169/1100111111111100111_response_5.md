The issue with the `quantile` function in the DataFrame class is that when it receives a DataFrame containing DateTime data, it fails to handle it properly and throws a ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate". The issue was reported on GitHub, highlighting that the `quantile` method does not return as expected when applied to a DataFrame with DateTime data.

The cause of the bug lies in the `_get_numeric_data()` method, which is used to filter the numeric data from the DataFrame. When the DataFrame contains DateTime data, the `_get_numeric_data()` method is unable to handle the data appropriately, leading to an empty result and eventually causing the failure.

To fix this bug, the `_get_numeric_data()` method within the `quantile` function should be modified to handle DateTime data correctly and return the expected output. Additionally, the logic for handling DateTime data within the `quantile` function itself needs to be updated to align with the expected behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number, np.datetime64])
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return DataFrame(result, index=q, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        return Series(result, index=data.columns, name=q)
```

In this corrected version, the numeric and DateTime data are handled appropriately when filtering the data within the `quantile` method, ensuring that the right data is selected for quantile computation.

This corrected version should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and ensure that the `quantile` function returns the expected output when applied to a DataFrame containing DateTime data.
