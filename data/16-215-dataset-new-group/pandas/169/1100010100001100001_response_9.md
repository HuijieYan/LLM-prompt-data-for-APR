The issue with the buggy `quantile` function is that it fails to return the correct quantile values when the input `q` is an array. This is evident from the incorrect values of `data` and `data.T` at the time of return. The bug also affects the function when `q` is a single float value, as the resulting Series or DataFrame does not accurately represent the quantile values.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the correct data is being used for computation, regardless of the `numeric_only` parameter.
2. We need to address the issue where the function is returning incorrect results when `q` is an array.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = result.T  # Transpose back if q is an array

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we make use of the `quantile` method of the DataFrame, which handles the computation of quantiles for both single values of `q` and arrays of `q` correctly. We also ensure that the transposition is handled appropriately in the case of arrays of `q`.
