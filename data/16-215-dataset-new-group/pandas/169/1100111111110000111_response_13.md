The issue seems to be related to the concatenation of empty arrays, causing a ValueError in the quantile function when operating with datetime data in a DataFrame.

To fix this, we can modify the condition for checking if the result is empty and handle it appropriately before performing the concatenation. 

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    ... (same as original)
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2 and result.size > 0:  # Check if result is not empty
        result = self._constructor(result)
    elif result.ndim == 1 and isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.size > 0:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a check for an empty result before performing the concatenation or creating a DataFrame, we can prevent the ValueError that was previously occurring due to an empty array. This should resolve the issue and make the corrected function pass the failing test.
