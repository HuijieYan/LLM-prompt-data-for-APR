The cause of the bug is that there is a problem with the `pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range('1/1/18', periods=5)).quantile()` call. The issue is that when the DataFrame contains datetime data, the `pd.date_range('1/1/18', periods=5))` produces a DataFrame with only a single column, and that leads to the error when trying to compute the quantile of the DataFrame. The error happens because the code is attempting to concatenate arrays when the DataFrame has no columns. The expected output is that the DataFrame should return just as a Series does.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `quantile` function so that when it is operating on datetime data and there is only one column, it behaves as a Series. This will ensure that the quantile computation is done correctly without attempting to concatenate arrays.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    # Check if the result is a DataFrame with only one column, if so, transform it to a Series
    if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame) and len(result.columns) == 1:
        result = result[result.columns[0]]

    return result
```

With this modification, the `quantile` function should now handle the scenario when a DataFrame with only one column is provided and produce the output just as a Series does. This would fix the bug and ensure that the DataFrame returns correctly when calculating the quantile.
