To fix the buggy function:
1. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The `_check_percentile` method.
   - The `data = self._get_numeric_data()` line might have issues because it depends on the implementation of the `_get_numeric_data` method.
   - The `axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)` line might also contain a bug if the `_get_axis_number` method is not functioning properly.
   - The way the `result` is constructed and transposed might also be prone to errors.

2. The cause of the bug in the buggy function could be a combination of incorrect data manipulation and incorrect axis handling, which could lead to erroneous results.

3. To fix the bug, it is recommended to thoroughly test each method that is being called within the function to ensure they are providing the expected results. It's also important to carefully handle the transposition of data and construct the result appropriately.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    if not isinstance(q, (float, list, np.ndarray)):
        raise ValueError("q must be a float or an array-like object")
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    
    if axis == 1:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)
    
    return result
```

In the corrected version, we have simplified the logic and made use of the existing `quantile` method available for the data object. We also performed additional checks on the input and reduced the complexity of the original implementation.
