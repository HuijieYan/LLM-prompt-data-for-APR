The bug seems to occur due to the manipulation of the data and the handling of transpose operations. The bug is likely caused by incorrectly handling the transposed data and not updating the column labels correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data transposition is handled correctly and that the column labels are updated accordingly. Additionally, we should check if the input `q` is a list and handle it appropriately to return a DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=self.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q, index=self.columns)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case when `q` is a list to return a DataFrame with the index set to `q` and the columns being the same as the original DataFrame. Otherwise, we return a Series with the index set to the columns of the original DataFrame.

This should address the bug and handle different input cases correctly.
