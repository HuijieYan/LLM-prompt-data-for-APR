The bug in the provided function seems to occur in the following section of code:

```python
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
```

The bug seems to be related to the way the result is being constructed, as it leads to `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for constructing the result is not handling the case where `result` is empty or a scalar value. The error message indicates that there is an attempt to concatenate arrays, which is not possible with an empty result.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where `result` is empty or a scalar value, and construct the result accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if not result.empty:  # Check if result is not empty
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

By checking if `result` is empty or a scalar value and constructing the result accordingly, the function should be able to handle cases where the `ValueError` was being raised.
