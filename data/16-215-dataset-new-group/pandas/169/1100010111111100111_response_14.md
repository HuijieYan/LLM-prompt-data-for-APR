The issue occurs because the `_get_numeric_data` function may drop all columns for datatime data when this method is called.

The cause of the bug is that the quantile function in the DataFrame is not handling datetime data appropriately. When the quantile method is called with datetime data, it attempts to concatenate arrays, leading to the ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate". This is due to the list of datetime data being incorrectly treated as a list of arrays to concatenate.

To resolve this issue, a strategy to fix the bug is to explicitly check whether the data is numeric before calling the _get_numeric_data method, and handle datetime data separately. The fix should involve checking the data type and only passing the data to the quantile algorithm if it is numeric. This would prevent the ValueError from being raised due to the concatenation of datetime data.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self.astype('float64') if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if numeric_only:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    else:
        result = data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check the numeric_only flag before calling the _get_numeric_data method. If numeric_only is true, we convert the data to float64 before calling the quantile algorithm. Otherwise, we directly call the quantile algorithm without converting to float64. This approach ensures that the quantile method handles datetime and timedelta data appropriately without attempting to concatenate arrays, thereby fixing the bug.
