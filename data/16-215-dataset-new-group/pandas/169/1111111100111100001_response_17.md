The issue seems to be related to the `concat` operation not receiving any arrays to concatenate when the `quantile` function is called.

Looking at the source code of the `quantile` function, it seems that the `self._get_numeric_data()` method call may be erroneously returning an empty DataFrame when `numeric_only` is `True`. This would then result in no data to be processed in the subsequent operations, leading to the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error.

In the code, the `self._get_numeric_data()` method is used to retrieve only the numeric columns from the DataFrame. This means that when `numeric_only` is `True`, it should filter out non-numeric columns and return the remaining numeric data. However, it seems that it's failing to do so in the given cases.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `self._get_numeric_data()` method should be inspected to ensure that it correctly filters out non-numeric columns and returns the expected data.

Additionally, the `self._check_percentile(q)` method call should be investigated to ensure that it is correctly validating the given quantile values and not interfering with the data retrieval.

Finally, the logic for handling the result from the quantile operation should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly constructs the resulting DataFrame or Series based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we removed the manual handling of the quantile calculation and rely on the `data.quantile` method to perform the operation directly on the DataFrame. This ensures that the internal implementation of quantile calculation in pandas is used, and potential issues related to handling data are addressed by pandas itself.
