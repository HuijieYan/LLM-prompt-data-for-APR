Potential error locations:
1. The `_check_percentile` function is being called on `self`, but it is not clear what this function does or how it may affect the calculation of the quantile.
2. The condition to transpose the data based on the axis is not handled correctly, as seen in the failing tests.

Cause of the bug:
The `_check_percentile` function may be altering the input `q` in an unexpected way, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the transposition of the data is not accounted for properly, which results in an incorrect output.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review and potentially modify the `_check_percentile` function to ensure it is handling the input `q` correctly.
2. Update the data transposition step to ensure it is applied correctly based on the value of the `axis` parameter.

Corrected Version:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the `quantile` function directly calls the `quantile` method on the data, passing the parameters `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation` directly, which should handle the calculations correctly based on the input parameters without the need for additional manual handling.
