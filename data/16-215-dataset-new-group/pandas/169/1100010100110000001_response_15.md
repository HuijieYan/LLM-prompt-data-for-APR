The error message is a `ValueError` that occurs when attempting to concatenate at least one array. This suggests that there is a problem with the data being passed to the `quantile` function.

The potential error location within the buggy function may be with the `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self` line, which may not be returning the expected data for quantile calculation.

The bug may be caused by the incorrect data being passed to the `quantile` function, leading to an empty or incorrect array being concatenated and resulting in the `ValueError`.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the correct data is being passed to the `quantile` function. This can be done by validating the data and checking for any potential issues with how it is being retrieved from other functions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    
    ... (same docstring as provided in the original function) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Get the data based on the numeric_only parameter
    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    # Get the axis number
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # Check if the axis is transposed
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    # Transpose the data if necessary
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Calculate the quantile
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
