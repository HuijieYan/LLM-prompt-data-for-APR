To fix the bug in the `DataFrame.quantile` function, we need to ensure that the call to `self._constructor_sliced` is performed correctly. This function is responsible for constructing a new DataFrame when the result of the quantile function is a 1-dimensional array. The issue arises from incorrect concatenation of the 1-dimensional array, leading to the "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" error.

Based on this analysis, the bug fix involves ensuring that the `self._constructor_sliced` function is called with the correct parameters, so it constructs a new DataFrame appropriately. Additionally, the detection of whether the result is a 1-dimensional array or not needs to be revisited.

Here is the corrected version of the `DataFrame.quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        # Check if the result is a DataFrame with a single column
        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame) and result.shape[1] == 1:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result.iloc[:, 0], name=q)
        else:
            # If not, it implies the result is a Series or DataFrame.
            result = self._constructor(result, index=[q])

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The corrections involve adding conditional checks to determine if the result is a 1-dimensional array within a DataFrame and using `self._constructor_sliced` accordingly. Once the correction is made as above, the `DataFrame.quantile` function should return correct results and pass the failing test. Additionally, this fix resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding the quantile operation on a DataFrame with datetime data.
