The bug in the `quantile` function seems to be caused by an issue with accessing the data and transposing it correctly when determining the quantile values.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to review the logic for transposing the data and ensuring that it is correctly handled for both single quantile values and multiple quantile values.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the key change is made in the line where the `quantile` function is called on the `data` to calculate the quantile values. The `axis` parameter of the `quantile` function is set based on whether the data is transposed or not, ensuring the correct quantile values are calculated in both cases. Additionally, if `q` is a list or array, the resulting data is transposed before returning to ensure the correct shape.
