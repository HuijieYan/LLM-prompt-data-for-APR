The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the quantile calculation not working correctly for DataFrames with datetime data. This is evident from the GitHub issue titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" and the failing test cases provided.

The main issue causing the bug appears to be related to the handling of datetime data.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to modify the logic to handle datetime data appropriately when calculating the quantile for DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`.

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """

    data = self.select_dtypes(include=np.number) if numeric_only else self

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```
In the corrected version, the quantile calculation directly operates on DataFrame `data` and returns the appropriate result.

This modified version should address the issue with the quantile calculation for DataFrames with datetime data, as reported in the GitHub issue.
