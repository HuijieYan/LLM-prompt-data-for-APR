The `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error message occurs when the `concat_compat` function in the `pandas/core/dtypes/concat.py` file attempts to concatenate arrays, but finds none to concatenate.

The potential error locations within the buggy function is:
1. The `_check_percentile(q)` may not be correctly checking the percentile and affecting the data.
2. The call to `data._data.quantile` may not be returning the expected values.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of data when calculating the quantile, leading to an error in concatenating arrays.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data is correctly handled when calculating the quantile in the `quantile` function. Specifically, we should check the handling of the percentile and how it affects the data, as well as the correctness of the `data._data.quantile` calculation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (other comments remain the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q, axis=axis)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=0 if is_transposed else 1, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the main change is in the `result = data.quantile()` line, which was updated to use the `quantile` method directly on the data, and ensure the correct axis is used based on whether the data is transposed or not. By using the `quantile` method directly, we can leverage the existing functionality of the `pandas` library for calculating the quantile, and avoid potential issues related to data handling and concatenation.
