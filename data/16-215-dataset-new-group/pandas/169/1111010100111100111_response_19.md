The bug appears to be occurring when the `quantile` function is called on a DataFrame with datetime data. The function is intended to return the values at the given quantiles over the requested axis, but it seems to fail when dealing with datetime data.

The cause of the bug:
1. The `quantile` function includes a conditional statement that checks for `numeric_only`. If `numeric_only` is `False`, the quantile of datetime data should also be computed. However, the implementation of this functionality seems to be causing an issue, as observed from the failing test cases.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the implementation of the conditional statement to correctly allow for the computation of quantiles of both numeric and datetime data when `numeric_only` is `False`.
2. Ensure that the data handling logic within the function accurately accounts for the different data types and computes quantiles as expected.

Given the analysis and the GitHub issue, here's a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if len(result.columns) > 0:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version should address the issue described in the GitHub report and allow for the computation of quantiles for datetime data when `numeric_only` is `False`.
