To fix the bug, it's important to identify the root cause. The failing tests indicate that the buggy function is erroring out when dealing with DataFrame containing datetime data. The issue from GitHub also supports this, indicating that DataFrame quantile is broken with datetime data. The failing tests also show that the error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" is thrown during the execution of the buggy function when dealing with the DataFrame containing datetime data. Therefore, the bug appears to be caused by a mishandling of DataFrame containing datetime data inside the `quantile` function.

Given this insight, a potential strategy for fixing this bug is to add proper handling for datetime data in the `quantile` function. This may involve using a conditional check to differentiate between datetime and other data types, and adjusting the quantile calculation accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_datetime = data.select_dtypes(include='datetime').shape[1] > 0
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_datetime:
        result = data._data.quantile(q)
    else:
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, an additional conditional check for datetime data (`is_datetime`) has been added. If the DataFrame contains datetime data, the quantile is computed directly using `data._data.quantile(q)`. Otherwise, if the data does not contain datetime data, the existing logic for computation is used. This approach allows for different handling of datetime data in the quantile calculation, addressing the bug identified from both the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
