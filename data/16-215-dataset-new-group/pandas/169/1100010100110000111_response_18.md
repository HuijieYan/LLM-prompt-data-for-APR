Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the problem arises when `pd.DataFrame().quantile()` is called on a DataFrame containing datetime data. The `quantile` method seems to be failing to handle DateTime data resulting in a ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate.

The issue arises due to how the `_get_numeric_data()` and the `is_transposed` boolean are being used in the quantile function. The `data` object used within the function appears to have no numeric data, which causes the error when calling `data._data.quantile()`. This is because `_get_numeric_data()` returns an empty DataFrame when there's no numeric data, instead of the original DataFrame. Additionally, the transposed flag seems unnecessary and redundant, especially as it triggers the `data.T` operation.

The fix involves using the original DataFrame when numeric_only is False, which would include DateTime data. Moreover, the transposed flag should not be used to change the data, as itâ€™s not required in this context.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    # remove redundant transposed flag
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- The numeric_only argument is used to determine whether to include non-numeric data, which ensures that datetime and timedelta data are not excluded.
- The redundant `is_transposed` flag usage was removed, addressing the unnecessary manipulation of the data during calculations.

This corrected version should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
