The bug in the provided code seems to be that the function isn't handling the case when the DataFrame has no columns. This is causing the failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` to fail. The bug is in the `quantile` function, which is not properly handling the input when `data` has no columns and is transposed. This results in incorrect return values, causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the columns are empty before attempting to transpose the data. If the columns are empty, we should proceed with the quantile calculation without transposing the data.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.columns.empty:  # Check if columns are empty
        is_transposed = False  # If columns are empty, do not transpose

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
``` 

This corrected version includes a check for empty columns and adjusts the transposition accordingly. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
