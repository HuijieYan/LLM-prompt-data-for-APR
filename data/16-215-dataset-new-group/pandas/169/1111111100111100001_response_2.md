Looking at the function `quantile` inside the `DataFrame` class of the pandas library, we can see that the code attempts to compute the quantile over a requested axis for a DataFrame. The `quantile` method should return the value at the given quantile for the specified axis. However, there are clear issues with the code that are causing it to fail.

1. The function calculates the quantile of the input DataFrame based on the provided parameters `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`. It then manipulates the data and attempts to calculate the result, which will be returned.

2. The cause of the bug is likely related to the data manipulation and calculation steps inside the function, which result in incorrect values as indicated by the failing tests and the relevant variable values.

3. One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the data manipulation and quantile calculation steps are performed correctly and handle edge cases where necessary. Additionally, properly handling cases where no valid quantile can be computed should also be considered.

Here's a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    # Get the numeric data if numeric_only is True, otherwise use self
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    # Get the axis number based on the input
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # Transpose the data if the axis is column-wise
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Compute the quantile based on the provided parameters
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    # If the result is a 2D array, create a new DataFrame; otherwise, create a Series
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    # Transpose the result back if the data was transposed
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the quantile is computed directly from the DataFrame `data`. The use of non-existent functions and incorrect manipulation of the data has been removed, and the result is correctly returned based on the input parameters. This corrected version should now pass the failing test scenarios.
