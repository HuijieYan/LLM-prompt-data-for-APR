The bug in the provided function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the input parameters and their interaction with the internal variables. The key issues are the empty DataFrame being returned for the 'data' variable and the inconsistent behavior when 'q' is a float or a list. Additionally, the transposition of the DataFrame is not properly handled, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should handle both individual float values and lists of quantiles. It should also properly transpose the DataFrame before calculating the quantile if 'axis' is set to 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T  # Transpose the result back if 'q' is a list

    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the quantile calculation is performed correctly for both a single quantile value and a list of quantiles. It also properly handles the transposition of the DataFrame based on the 'axis' parameter.
