Looking at the buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class, it appears that the error is occurring due to an empty DataFrame being generated and manipulated inside the function, resulting in a ValueError when trying to concatenate arrays.

After analyzing the function and the failing test, as well as the runtime input/output values, we can identify the potential causes of the bug:
1. The `quantile` function seems to be returning an empty DataFrame or Series, leading to concatenation errors, as evident in the failing test.
2. The generation and manipulation of an empty DataFrame inside the function, possibly due to the `_get_numeric_data` function, is causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the input DataFrame is empty, and ensure that the appropriate types and shapes of data are returned to avoid concatenation errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    if data.empty:
        # Handle case where data is empty
        if isinstance(q, list):
            result = self._constructor(data=np.nan, index=q, columns=data.columns)
        else:
            result = pd.Series(data=np.nan, index=data.columns, name=q)
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case where the data is empty separately, by returning an appropriate empty DataFrame or Series based on the input `q`. This should address the concatenation error and ensure the function passes the failing test.
