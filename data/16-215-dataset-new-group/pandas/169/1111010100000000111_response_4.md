The cause of the bug seems to be related to an issue when using the `quantile` method with datetime data in a DataFrame, which is not behaving as expected when compared to using the same method with a Series. The result of `pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range('1/1/18', periods=5)).quantile()` should return a single timestamp value, just like `pd.Series(pd.date_range('1/1/18', periods=5)).quantile()` does, but instead, it raises a ValueError.

The bug appears to be related to the logic inside the `quantile` function, where the data is being processed and manipulated for computation of the quantile. The issue might be with the way the data is being transposed or processed, resulting in an unexpected behavior when the data is of datetime type.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `quantile` function needs to be adjusted to handle datetime data correctly. Specifically, the way the data is transposed or processed should be updated to handle all possible data types, including datetime.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        if isinstance(result, (float, int, np.integer)):
            result = pd.Series(result, index=data.columns)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, an additional check has been added to handle the case where the result is a single quantile value. If the result is a single value, it is converted to a Series with the index as the columns of the DataFrame, similar to how it would behave with a Series.

This should resolve the issue with the `quantile` method when using datetime data in a DataFrame and ensure that it returns the correct result as expected.
