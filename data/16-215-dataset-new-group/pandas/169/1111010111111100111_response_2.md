The cause of the bug appears to be a placeholder variable, `cols`, which is used to store the nominal column. However, the "captain tightpants" column (currently named `cols`) is for informational purposes only, and declares the name of the columns. Another potential source of the bug is in the `_get_numeric_data()` function which is erroneously returning an empty DataFrame when all columns are of a non-numeric, non-date type. This leads to incorrect results when `quantile` is called. To fix this, the `_get_numeric_data()` should be modified to return valid data for the non-numeric case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Other function code here...
    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
        if data.empty:  # Check if the DataFrame is non-numeric
            data = self
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version checks if `data` is empty, and if so, assigns `self` to `data`. This change ensures that the correct data is used for calculation when `numeric_only` is `True`. This strategy should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and pass the failing test.
