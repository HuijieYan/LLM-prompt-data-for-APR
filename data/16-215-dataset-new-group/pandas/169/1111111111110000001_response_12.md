The bug occurs in the `DataFrame.quantile` function, where the `result` is calculated using the `data._data.quantile` method with interpolation and other parameters. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`, which suggests that the data being processed is empty, leading to an error when trying to calculate the quantile.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the scenario where the input DataFrame has no numeric data, causing the attempted concatenation of empty data to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where there is no numeric data in the DataFrame. We can return an empty DataFrame or Series in this case to avoid the error.

The corrected version of the function would include the following addition to handle empty or non-numeric data:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    ... (function docstring remains the same)
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    if data.empty or (isinstance(data, pd.Series) and not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(data.dtype)):
        if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
            return pd.DataFrame(index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            return pd.Series(name=q, index=self.columns)

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this addition, the function will handle the case of empty or non-numeric data, returning an empty DataFrame or Series as appropriate.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
