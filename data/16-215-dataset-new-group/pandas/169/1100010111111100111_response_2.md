### Bug Location
The bug could be in the data assignment, the result derivation, or the order of the transposed operations.

### Bug Explanation
The DataFrame quantile method is not working correctly with date-time data. The failing test is trying to find the quantile for a DataFrame containing date-time data. The failing test results in errors due to improper handling of the date-time data.

The buggy function quantile includes a line - `result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)` where the data from the DataFrame is utilized to find the quantiles. However, in the failing test cases, when the data contains only date-time values, it seems the function is causing an issue with transposing the data properly, and consequently, the concatenation function results in the error "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate".

### Bug Fix Strategy
A potential fix would involve ensuring that during the computation of the quantile, the date-time values are effectively handled and that the transposition of the data is done appropriately. This would involve reviewing the logic for handling non-numeric data, handling transposition, and ensuring that the correct axes are used for the calculation.
```
Potential Fix:
- Add a conditional check to identify data types, so when dealing with non-numeric data, data._data.quantile() can be avoided.
- Adjust the transposition logic to ensure it only transposes if necessary.
- Update the method of data retrieval or usage to avoid the concatenation error caused by the date-time data.
```

### Corrected Version
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (existing documentation) ...

    Returns
    -------
    ... (existing documentation) ...
    """

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```
