The bug appears to be related to the DataFrame quantile operation when working with datetime data. This bug causes an error with a ValueError, "need at least one array to concatenate," which occurs when calling the `quantile` function on a DataFrame with datetime data.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function and the failing tests, the potential error location appears to be around the line `result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)`. Specifically, it seems that when working with datetime data and calling the quantile function, the internal operation is failing, leading to the "need at least one array to concatenate" error.

The cause of this bug is likely due to the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function. Since datetime data has different handling requirements compared to numerical data, the internal operation for quantile calculation may need to be adapted to handle datetime data appropriately.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the internal operation within the `quantile` function to handle datetime data correctly. This may involve adding a conditional check to identify datetime data and perform the quantile calculation accordingly. Additionally, it may involve addressing the concatenation error that arises when attempting to compute the quantile of datetime data.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function to address the bug:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if isinstance(self.dtypes[0], (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
        data = self
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(self.dtypes[0], (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
        result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q))
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes a conditional check to distinguish between handling datetime data and numerical data when performing the quantile operation. For datetime data, it leverages the DataFrame's `apply` function to calculate the quantile, while for numerical data, it uses the existing quantile calculation approach. This modification should resolve the bug related to the quantile operation for DataFrame with datetime data.
