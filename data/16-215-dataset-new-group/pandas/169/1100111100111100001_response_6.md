The bug in the provided function is causing a ValueError: "need at least one array to concatenate." This is because the existing code in the quantile method of the DataFrame class in the pandas module is intended to calculate quantiles, but an empty DataFrame is being generated and results in the concatenation error. 

The issue is that the code is trying to generate quantiles for an empty DataFrame and the intermediate computations are failing. 

One strategy to fix the bug is to include a condition to check if the DataFrame is empty and handle this edge case separately. If the DataFrame is empty, the function could return an empty DataFrame or raise an appropriate exception.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    if self.empty:
        return self.__class__()

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
    # existing code for computing and returning the quantiles
```

By checking if the DataFrame is empty and returning an empty DataFrame using `self.__class__()` , we avoid the concatenation error and ensure that the quantile function handles the edge case of an empty DataFrame.
