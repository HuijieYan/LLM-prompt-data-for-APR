The bug in the `quantile` function is causing the failing test to not return the expected results. The issue appears to be with the `data` variable, which is an empty DataFrame, and the `cols` variable, which is an empty Index. This results in incorrect values being calculated for `result`. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the appropriate data is being used for the quantile calculation.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    (same as before)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

    (same as before)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    result = data.quantile(q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we use the `quantile` method of the DataFrame to calculate the quantile values, which will ensure that the correct data is used in the calculation.

By making this change, the failing test should pass and return the expected results.
