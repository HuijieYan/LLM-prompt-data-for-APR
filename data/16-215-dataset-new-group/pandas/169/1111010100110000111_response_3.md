### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The line `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self` could be causing the error if `self._get_numeric_data()` does not return data in the correct format.
2. The line `result = data._data.quantile(...)` might also be causing the error if `data._data` does not have the expected structure or if the quantile computation is incorrect.

### Explanation of the bug:

The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` when trying to compute the quantile over datetime data in a DataFrame.

Looking at the code, the bug seems to be related to the `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self` which is trying to obtain the numeric data based on the `numeric_only` parameter, and `result = data._data.quantile(...)` which is the line that computes the quantile.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

The logic for obtaining the numeric data and computing the quantile should be adjusted to handle datetime data correctly. Ensuring that the data returned by `self._get_numeric_data()` is in the expected format and that the quantile computation handles datetime data appropriately is essential for fixing the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])  # Obtain only numeric data
    else:
        data = self

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we use the `select_dtypes` method to obtain only the numeric data when `numeric_only` is `True` and use the DataFrame's built-in `quantile` method to compute the quantile. This approach ensures that handling of different data types, including datetime data, is done correctly by the library's internal methods.
