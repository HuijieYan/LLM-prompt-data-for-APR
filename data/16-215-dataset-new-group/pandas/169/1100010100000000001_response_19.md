The potential error location in the code is within the `_check_percentile` method, as it is being called without being defined within the function. This may cause the function to raise an error.

The cause of the bug is that the `_check_percentile` method is being called without being defined within the function, which will result in an error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to define the `_check_percentile` method within the function or remove the call to the method if it is not necessary for the functionality of the function. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle potential errors that could arise from the `self._get_numeric_data()` method and the `self._get_axis_number(axis)` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
