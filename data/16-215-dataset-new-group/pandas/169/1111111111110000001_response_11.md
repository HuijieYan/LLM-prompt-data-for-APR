The buggy function in the code is the `quantile` method of the DataFrame class in the pandas' core/frame.py file.

The failing test quantile_empty_no_columns is testing the quantile function with an empty DataFrame and expects an empty Series and an empty DataFrame as the result.

The error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" indicates that there is an issue with concatenating arrays.

The cause of the bug is that the `_constructor` and `_constructor_sliced` methods may not handle the case when the input data is empty properly. This leads to an attempt to concatenate empty arrays, resulting in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the `_constructor` and `_constructor_sliced` methods of the DataFrame class should handle the case when the input data is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (other parts of the docstring remain the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    # Handling the case when the result is empty
    if result.size == 0:
        if isinstance(q, float):
            result = pd.Series([])
        else:
            result = pd.DataFrame([])

        result.name = q
    else:
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, a check for the case when the result is empty has been added before constructing the resultant Series or DataFrame, and in that case, an empty Series or DataFrame is returned accordingly. This should fix the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
