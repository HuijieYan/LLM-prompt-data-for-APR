The bug in the `quantile` function in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file is causing the failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` to produce a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error. This error occurs when trying to concatenate arrays when there is no data present.

The bug seems to be related to data handling in the `quantile` function when the DataFrame contains datetime data. The `data` variable, which is supposed to contain numeric data after the `_get_numeric_data` check, ends up being an empty DataFrame, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the handling of datetime data in the `quantile` function needs to be modified to ensure the proper data is selected for quantile computation. Based on the failing test and the runtime values, the `data` variable does not contain any data when it should, which leads to the error. Therefore, adjustments need to be made to the logic of handling datetime data and the `_get_numeric_data` check.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (other code remains the same)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

    ... (other documentation remains the same)

    """

    # Adjusted logic to handle datetime data
    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number'])
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks whether to include numeric data only or use all data. It then selects the appropriate data based on the `numeric_only` parameter before computing the quantile as before. This adjustment ensures that the correct data is used for quantile computation and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
