From the provided source code and failing test, we can identify the potential location of the bug within the `_quantile` function of the DataFrame class in the pandas/core/frame.py file. The error message from the failing test indicates a ValueError related to concatenating arrays. 

The runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function show that the data is empty, and the concatenation is resulting in an error due to the lack of arrays to concatenate. This indicates that the bug is likely related to handling empty data frames or incorrect handling of transposed data frames.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of an empty data frame before performing any operations that would lead to concatenation. We should also ensure that transposed data frames are handled correctly. 

Here's the corrected version of the _quantile function:

```python
def _quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only and not self.empty else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if not data.empty:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    else:
        result = self._constructor()

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the data frame is empty. If it is, it creates and returns a new instance of the DataFrame class without performing any other operations. This addresses the issue of handling empty data frames. If the data frame is not empty, it proceeds with the original logic for computing the quantile.

By incorporating this fix, the function should now pass the failing test.
