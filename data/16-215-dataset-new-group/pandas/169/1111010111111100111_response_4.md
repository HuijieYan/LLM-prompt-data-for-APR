The bug seems to originate from the function `quantile` in the DataFrame class in the pandas module. The bug is causing `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` as seen in the GitHub issue. The issue seems to relate to datetime data while calculating quantiles.

Upon analyzing the function code, specifically the portions where the bug seems to be triggered, it seems the issue lies in the logic that handles DataFrame with no numeric data, specifically the part `data = self._get_numeric_data()`.

The cause of the bug seems to be the erroneous behavior when handling DataFrames with no numeric data. This causes the subsequent operations and calculations to fail and results in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle DataFrames with no numeric data more gracefully. One potential strategy would be to include a check to return quickly with the requisite empty results if the DataFrame contains no numeric data.

For example, a check to verify if the DataFrame is empty or does not contain any numeric data could be performed at the beginning of the function, and in such cases, the function would return immediately with the expected empty results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        # New code to handle empty DataFrame or non-numeric data
        if self.empty or not self._get_numeric_data().empty:
            return pd.Series([], index=[], name=q) if np.isscalar(q) else pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[])
    
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
    
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
    
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    
        return result
```

This modification ensures that the function first checks for the presence of numeric data, and if not present, immediately returns with the expected empty results to handle the empty DataFrame or non-numeric data condition.
