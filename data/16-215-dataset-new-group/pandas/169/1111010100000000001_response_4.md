Potential Error Locations:
- The error could be in the `data = self._get_numeric_data()` line if `numeric_only` is set to `False` and `self` does not contain only numeric data.
- Another potential error could be in the `_constructor` and `_constructor_sliced` methods, as they may be returning the wrong type of object.
- There could be an issue with the logic of transposing the data.

Explanation of Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that when `numeric_only` is set to `False`, the function still calls `self._get_numeric_data()` without checking whether the data is numeric or not, leading to potential errors. Also, the logic for transposing the data might not be implemented correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check for whether the data is numeric before calling `self._get_numeric_data()`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the logic for transposing the data is implemented correctly. We should also review and possibly update the `_constructor` and `_constructor_sliced` methods to ensure they are returning the correct object type.

Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0,
        interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
In the corrected code, the `numeric_only` check was added to avoid calling `_get_numeric_data` unnecessarily. The logic for transposing the data was also updated. Lastly, the code was updated to correctly handle the result based on its dimensions.
