The bug is likely with the concatenation of the arrays in the `_concat_compat` function in the `pandas.core.dtypes.concat` module, as indicated by the error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate."

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input arrays are not empty when performing the concatenation.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = None  # Initialize result variable
    if not data.empty:  # Check if the data is not empty
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result is not None and result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    elif result is not None:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed and result is not None:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the `data` object is not empty before calling the `.quantile` method on it. If `data` is empty, the `result` variable remains `None`, and the function returns `None` as well. The function also explicitly checks if `result` is not `None` before performing further operations on it to avoid potential errors.

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
