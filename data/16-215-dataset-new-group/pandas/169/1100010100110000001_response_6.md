The error message points to an issue with concatenation, specifically with needing at least one array to concatenate. This suggests that the `data` variable may be empty when attempting to concatenate it.

The potential error location is within the `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self` line, where the `data` variable can be empty if there is no numeric data in the DataFrame.

The bug is caused by the function not handling the case where there is no numeric data in the DataFrame correctly, leading to an empty `data` variable and triggering the error during concatenation.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to check if the `data` variable is empty, and if it is, then return an empty DataFrame or Series depending on the type of data. This can prevent the function from attempting to concatenate an empty array.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # ... (other parts remain the same)

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame):
            return pd.DataFrame()
        elif isinstance(data, pd.Series):
            return pd.Series()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, after getting the `data` variable, it is checked whether it is empty. If it is, then an empty DataFrame or Series is returned accordingly. This ensures that the function does not attempt to concatenate an empty array and resolves the issue.
