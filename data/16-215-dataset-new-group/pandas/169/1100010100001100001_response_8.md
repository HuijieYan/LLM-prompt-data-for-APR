The buggy function appears to have issues with the handling of input parameters and the manipulation of the DataFrame. It seems to be encountering problems with the data retrieval and transposition.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `self._get_numeric_data()` function might not be returning the expected numeric data.
2. Data manipulation logic for transposing the DataFrame might be impacting the results.

The cause of the bug could be related to the data types and structures not aligning as expected, leading to empty DataFrames and unexpected indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for extracting numeric data and transposing the DataFrame to ensure that the correct data is being operated on.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    if axis == 1:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we simplify the logic by directly using the `quantile` function on the DataFrame. We handle the transposition based on the axis value and directly compute the quantile without unnecessary complexity. This should address the issues with the bug and improve the function's performance.
