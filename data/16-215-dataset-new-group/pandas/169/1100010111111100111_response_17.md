The problem appears to be in the `data._data` variable, which seems to be empty when using the `quantile` method with a DataFrame containing datetime data. The output from the failing test indicates that the issue arises when trying to concatenate data, resulting in a ValueError with the message "need at least one array to concatenate."

This issue is also reflected in the runtime values of the variables inside the buggy function, where `data._data` is shown to be an empty BlockManager, which is likely leading to the problem with concatenation.

To fix this bug, the `data._data` variable should be examined, and a strategy to ensure that it is populated with the proper data should be implemented.

Given the buggy function and the identified issue, here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if len(self._get_numeric_data()) == 0:
        result = self.copy() if isinstance(q, float) else self.copy().rename(columns={c: q for c in self.columns})
    else:
        result = self._data.quantile(q=q, axis=self._get_axis_number(axis), interpolation=interpolation)
        if issubclass(result.dtype.type, np.floating):
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=self.columns)
        else:
            result = self._constructor(result)

    return result
```
In this corrected version, the DataFrame is checked to see if there is any numeric data available using `len(self._get_numeric_data())`, and based on that, the quantile operation is performed. If there is no numeric data available, the method returns a copy of the DataFrame or Series with the specified index. Otherwise, it performs the quantile operation using the original implementation.

This approach addresses the issue with the DataFrame quantile operation when there are no numeric columns and provides a solution to the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue.
