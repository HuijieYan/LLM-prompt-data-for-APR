The bug in the given function lies in the `data` variable assignment and further operations. This is evident from the error message, the failing test, and the GitHub issue description. The error message specifically points to a ValueError from the `concatenate` operation in the `_concat_compat` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `data` variable is not correctly assigned, causing the subsequent operations on `data` to fail, leading to the `ValueError` during concatenation.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the `data` variable is assigned the correct value, considering whether the data is numeric, and also handle edge cases such as the empty DataFrame as presented in the failing test.

Here's the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            result = pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            result = pd.Series([], name=q)

        return result

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=axis, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By ensuring that the `data` variable is handled correctly, and handling the case when the DataFrame is empty, as well as correctly passing the relevant parameters to the `quantile` operation, the corrected function addresses the bug and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.
