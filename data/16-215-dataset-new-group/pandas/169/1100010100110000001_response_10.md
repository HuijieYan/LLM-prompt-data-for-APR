The bug appears to be in the `quantile` function of the `pandas` library. The error message indicates a ValueError due to the need for at least one array to concatenate.

The potential error location within the buggy function could be in the section where `data._data.quantile()` is called, as the error message mentions the need for at least one array to concatenate.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the `data._data` object not containing the necessary arrays for concatenation, leading to the ValueError. This could be due to improper handling of empty data when calling the `quantile` function.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to add a check for empty data before attempting to perform the concatenation operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("Data is empty")

    result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The corrected version includes a check for empty data before performing the quantile computation. If the data is empty, a ValueError is raised. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
