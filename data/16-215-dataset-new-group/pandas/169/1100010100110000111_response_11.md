The cause of the issue is traced to the `pandas/core/frame.py` file, specifically within the `quantile` function. The issue is related to the fact that when using `pd.DataFrame.quantile()` with datatime data, it does not return the result properly, instead it raises a `ValueError` due to lack of array to concatenate internally. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the datetime and timedelta data.

To fix the bug, modification is needed in the `quantile` function with regards to its handling of datetime and timedelta data. A strategy to fix the bug could include checking the data type of `data` and then appropriately handling the conversion for datetime and timedelta types.

A potential fix for the bug in the `quantile` function would be to ensure that the datetime and timedelta data are handled differently, using a conditional check within the function to handle these specific data types.

Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    (Same as in the original function)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Handling datetime and timedelta data separately
    if data._is_datelike_mixed_type:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected version, the `quantile` function should now handle datetime and timedelta data properly, and the issue described should be resolved. This corrected version of the function should allow the failing test to pass and address the GitHub issue.
