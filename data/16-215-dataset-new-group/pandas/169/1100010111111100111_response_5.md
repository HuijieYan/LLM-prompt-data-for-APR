## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `_get_numeric_data()` function could be dropping all columns in some cases, leading to an empty DataFrame.
2. The `is_transposed` flag is set based on the `axis` parameter, and this manipulation may lead to incorrect results.
3. The `result` is constructed differently based on the dimension, and this might be leading to incorrect output.
4. The concatenation error in the test case is due to the empty data being concatenated without proper checks.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug can be due to the `_get_numeric_data()` function dropping all columns, resulting in an empty DataFrame. This empty DataFrame then influences the subsequent operations, leading to an incorrect output. Additionally, the manipulation of the `is_transposed` flag, and the construction of `result` based on dimension, might be causing inconsistencies in the output.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
1. Implement a check to ensure that the `data` DataFrame is not empty before processing.
2. Explicitly handle transposed and non-transposed cases to ensure correct operation.
3. Ensure that the construction of `result` is consistent and properly handles data frames and series.
4. Add checks to handle situations where there are empty data frames in the test cases.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if not len(self):
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return self._constructor(result)
    else:
        return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

```

With these changes, the function addresses the potential issues by checking for empty DataFrames and handling the transposed and non-transposed cases explicitly. It also addresses the inconsistency in constructing `result` and handles the situations with empty data frames in the test cases. These corrections should help in resolving the bug.
