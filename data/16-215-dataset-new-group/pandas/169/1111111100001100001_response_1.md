The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect calculation of the quantile. The function fails to calculate the quantile values correctly, leading to incorrect results. The bug is likely in the calculation of the quantile where the result is being calculated improperly, leading to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the quantile needs to be reviewed and corrected. It's possible that the logic for calculating the quantile is incorrect and needs to be updated. The use of `self._get_numeric_data()` may not be appropriate in all cases and should be reviewed, as well as the `is_transposed` variable and its impact on the calculation of the quantile.

Also, the variable `result` is obtained from the calculation of the quantile and then processed with `self._constructor` and `self._constructor_sliced`. This processing should be reviewed to ensure that the correct data and data structures are being returned.

It's also important to review the behavior of the `_check_percentile` function as it may impact the calculation of the quantile.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the calculation of the quantile is performed using the `data.quantile` method, and the result is updated based on the type of `q`. This should ensure that the quantile values are calculated correctly and returned appropriately based on the input parameters.
