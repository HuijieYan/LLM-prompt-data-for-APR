Potential Error Locations:
The bug could be located in the section where the 'result' variable is being computed, specifically where 'result' is assigned to a new DataFrame using the '_constructor' function.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely related to the fact that when 'df' does not have any numeric columns, the function fails to handle this case properly. This leads to unexpected behavior and causes the failing test to occur.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the quantile function to handle the case where 'df' does not have any numeric columns. This can be achieved by adding a check for empty columns and returning an empty Series or DataFrame as expected by the test case.

Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Check if 'data' is empty with no numeric columns
    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return self._constructor_sliced([], index=q)
        else:
            return self._constructor({})

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The corrected version includes a check for empty 'data' and returns an empty Series or DataFrame as expected by the failing test.
