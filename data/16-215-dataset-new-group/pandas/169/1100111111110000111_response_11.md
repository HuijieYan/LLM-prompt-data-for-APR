The bug is likely located in how the DataFrame is processed in the quantile function, specifically when working with datetime data.

The original code is failing with a ValueError that indicates the need for at least one array to concatenate. This error occurs when attempting to concatenate arrays but none are present. This may be related to how the DataFrame is being processed and how the concatenation of the results is being handled.

The bug description in the GitHub issue mentions that the DataFrame should return just as the Series does, suggesting that the current behavior of the quantile function with datetime data in DataFrames is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should start by reviewing the logic used to process DataFrames with datetime data in the quantile function. Specifically, it is important to verify how the DataFrame is processed, how the data types are handled, and how the final concatenation of the results is performed.

Here's the corrected version of the function, taking into account the suggestions provided:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the documentation remains the same)

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    if not isinstance(data, DataFrame):
        data = data.to_frame()
      
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version:
1. We have added a check to ensure that if the data is not already a DataFrame, it is converted to one using the `to_frame()` method.
2. This ensures that the data is handled consistently as a DataFrame, regardless of the initial input.
3. By correcting the data type handling, we can ensure that the concatenation and other operations within the function work correctly, resolving the issue with incorrect behavior when working with datetime data in DataFrames.

After applying these changes, run the failing test again to verify that the corrected function now passes the failing test and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
