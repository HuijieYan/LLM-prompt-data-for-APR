The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the way the `clocs` parameter is handled. When the `clocs` parameter is a tuple, the function attempts to get the level number for each item in the tuple. The bug occurs because the function expects a single level representation for the `clocs` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `_unstack_multiple` so that it can handle single-level or multi-level representations for the `clocs` parameter properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Convert single-level representation to multi-level

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

With this modification, the function `_unstack_multiple` is now able to handle both single-level and multi-level representations for the `clocs` parameter. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing test cases.
