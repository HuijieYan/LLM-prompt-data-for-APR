## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, the GitHub issue.

The buggy function in question is `_unstack_multiple` which is a Python function responsible for unstacking a Pandas DataFrame or Series with multiple columns or levels. It is called by the `unstack` function. The failing test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` is testing the unstacking of a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. There is also another failing test `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` for unstacking of a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. A GitHub issue with title "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" is posted and the user uploaded the error message and cc'd `@ibrahimsharaf, @toobaz`, asking if it was difficult.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function.

The error appears to be arising in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the statement `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. There are potential issues with handling the hierarchical columns and their levels that may be contributing to the failing tests.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the failing test, the GitHub Issue information.

The cause of the bug appears to be the incorrect handling of multiple hierarchical indices (also known as MultiIndex) in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` is focused on unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex where the expected output is not being generated, leading to the failure. The error mentioned in the GitHub issue also indicates a problem with MultiIndexed unstack operation, specifically related to a KeyError.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug.

The bug can be fixed by revisiting how the levels and indices within a MultiIndex are handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function. Additionally, there might be a need to validate the handling of the internal indices and levels to ensure that the unstack operation behaves correctly for MultiIndex columns.

## A corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
}
```

This corrected version uses `index.names.index(i)` instead of `_get_level_number` to correctly identify the level number, handling both tuple of names and individual names. This strategy aims to address the issue with MultiIndexed unstack operation and should resolve the failing test case.
