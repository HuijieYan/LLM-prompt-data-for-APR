Looking at the runtime input/output variable values and types of the buggy function's cases, the issue seems to arise from the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The problematic part of the function seems to be in the handling of different branches for `Series` and non-`Series` cases, along with the complexity involved in handling hierarchical columns with different levels.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to simplify the code by refactoring the logic to handle both `Series` and non-`Series` cases more uniformly, and addressing the handling of hierarchical columns more robustly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if index._get_level_number(i) not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Handle the hierarchical columns with different levels
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = Index(get_compressed_ids(ccodes), name="__placeholder__")
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [get_compressed_ids(ccodes)],
            codes=rcodes + [get_compressed_ids(ccodes)],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This refactored version simplifies the logic and handles both `Series` and non-`Series` cases uniformly, as well as properly addressing the handling of hierarchical columns with different levels.
