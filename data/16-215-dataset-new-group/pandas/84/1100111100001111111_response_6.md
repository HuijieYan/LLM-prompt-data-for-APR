The bug seems to occur due to incorrect handling of the hierarchy of column names in the `clocs` parameter, which leads to issues when unstacking the data. The function `_unstack_multiple` aims to handle hierarchical column unstacking, but it fails in the provided cases. The bug is identified based on the observed and expected variable values, types, and behaviors, as well as the GitHub issue description.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by an issue when extracting the level numbers (`_get_level_number`) from the given hierarchical column values, which leads to incorrect unstacking behavior and potentially raises a KeyError with the relevant level not being found.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can implement better handling of the hierarchy of column names when extracting the level numbers. By correcting this step, we ensure that the subsequent unstacking operations are performed on the correct levels in a multi-index DataFrame.

### Corrected function
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with additional comments for clarity:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Correct handling of hierarchical column names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function body remains unchanged
```

By making the correction described above, we improve the handling of hierarchical column names, ensuring that the unstacking operation on multi-index DataFrames works as intended.

With this fix, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
