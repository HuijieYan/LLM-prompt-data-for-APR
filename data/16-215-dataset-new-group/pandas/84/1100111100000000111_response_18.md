Based on the provided GitHub issue and the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the issue occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndexed series using the `unstack` method with tuple names. The `_unstack_multiple` function is responsible for handling multi-indexed unstack operations and is failing when dealing with hierarchical columns.

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function originates from the following lines:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

This line incorrectly uses the `_get_level_number` method to determine the levels of columns based on the provided `clocs`. This leads to ValueError and KeyError ("'A' is not in list" and "'Level A not found" respectively) when trying to access the levels that do not exist.

To fix the bug:
- Change the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` to use the `get_loc` method to retrieve the correct levels based on the names provided in `clocs`.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]  # Use get_loc to get the level number based on level names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # Remaining implementation stays the same...
```
