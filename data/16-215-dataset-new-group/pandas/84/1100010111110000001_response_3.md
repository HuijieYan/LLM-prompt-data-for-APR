The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` and the failing test is `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex`. 

The specific error in the failing test is `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`. This error occurs at line 320 in the function `_unstack_multiple`.

In the failing test, the input index is a `MultiIndex` with two levels ('A', 'a') and ('B', 'b'). When `df.unstack(("A", "a"))` is called, it triggers the `_unstack_multiple` function with `clocs` as `("A", "a")`. The buggy part is using `_get_level_number` to convert the column locations into level numbers. The error `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` indicates that the method `_get_level_number` is not able to correctly convert the level names to their corresponding level numbers, causing the bug in the function.

To fix the bug, the level names should be properly converted into level numbers. Since the names are in a tuple in the failing test case, the fix should handle tuples properly. This can be achieved by checking the data type of the input and then extracting the index based on the correct data type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By checking the data type of the input in `clocs` and appropriately extracting the index based on the type, we can fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly with tuples of level names.

After applying this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should pass the failing test without triggering the ValueError.
