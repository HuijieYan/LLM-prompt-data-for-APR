To fix the buggy function, we need to make sure that it correctly handles the unstacking of a MultiIndex DataFrame with columns that are tuples. We also need to ensure that the function returns the expected output for the failing test cases provided.

Looking at the first failing test case in which `clocs` is `('A', 'a')`, let's analyze the output and identify the issue. The issue is observed when creating the `dummy_index` and `unstacked`. The `dummy_index` should ideally represent the appropriate MultiIndex with levels and codes. However, the creation of `dummy_index` from `obs_ids` and `recons_codes` is not correct. As a result, the subsequent unstacking operation results in incorrect output.

Similarly, for the second and third failing test cases, we need to check if the creation of `dummy_index` and the subsequent unstacking of the DataFrame are performed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling hierarchical columns and unstacking of the DataFrame. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct MultiIndex is created and used for unstacking the DataFrame, considering the hierarchical column levels and codes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Create index and column codes and levels
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data.copy()
        for cloc in clocs:
            result = result.unstack(cloc, fill_value=fill_value)
        return result
    else:
        new_data = data.copy()
        columns = new_data.columns
       
        # Create new MultiIndex for unstacked DataFrame
        unstacked_columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
            columns, names=[None, *index.names[clocs]])
       
        # Unstack the DataFrame and assign new MultiIndex to columns
        unstacked = new_data.unstack(clocs).reindex(columns=unstacked_columns, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the unstacking of the DataFrame with tuple-named columns and pass the failing test cases.
