The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line. The `clocs` input variable is a tuple containing MultiIndex names, but the `_get_level_number` method expects a level number and not a label, which causes the KeyError: 'Level A not found'.

The fix to this bug involves modifying the `_get_level_number` line to handle the case when the `levels` is a MultiIndex. We can utilize the `get_loc` method of the MultiIndex to get the integer locations of the levels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]  # Use get_loc to obtain integer locations of the levels

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
