Based on the failing test and error messages, the bug exists in the `_get_level_number` call for multiindexed data. The error message indicates that the 'A' level is not found, which means that the mistaken assumption is made regarding the naming of the levels in the index. 

The failing call in the test is `df.unstack(("A", "a"))`, and the uncertain aspect is the way in which the `unstack` function operates when using tuple names within multiindexed data. The corrected function should include these aspects and be able to resolve the key error.

One solution for fixing the bug is to handle the levels differently based on the shape and hierarchy of the data. Specifically, if the columns are a `MultiIndex`, the function should unstack the specified level. This is similar to what happens for Series, where the function `unstack` seems to handle the case when no hierarchical columns are present. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index
    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        if isinstance(data.index, MultiIndex):
            return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            return data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
```

This version handles the unstacking for both Series and MultiIndex column data, properly unstacking based on the specified levels. The condition `if isinstance(data, Series)` and the subsequent `if/else` block determine the proper unstacking based on the type of the data. This should resolve the key error and also cover the cases from the failing test.
