The main issue with the current implementation of the function `_unstack_multiple` is that it does not handle the case where multiple levels are present in the index. The function is designed to unstack a single level of the index, but when multiple levels are present, it fails to do so correctly.

The function needs to be modified to handle the case where there are multiple levels in the index.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic to handle multi-level indices correctly. This can be achieved by iterating through the levels of the index and performing unstacking for each level, taking care to adjust the column positions and names accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Iterate through the levels to perform unstacking for each level
    unstacked_data = data
    new_columns = None
    for cloc in clocs:
        unstacked_data = unstacked_data.unstack(cloc, fill_value=fill_value)
        if new_columns is None:  # Store the new columns if not already done
            new_columns = unstacked_data.columns

    unstacked_data.columns = new_columns  # Update the columns with the new columns

    return unstacked_data
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to handle unstacking multiple levels in the index correctly and pass the failing test cases.
