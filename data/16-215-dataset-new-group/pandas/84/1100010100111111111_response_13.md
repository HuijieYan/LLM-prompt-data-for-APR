The issue here is that the function `_get_level_number` is failing to retrieve the level number, resulting in a `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`. This is caused by the fact that the level name is being used as the input for `_get_level_number`, while the function expects a level number.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the scenario where a tuple of level names is passed as the input parameter `clocs`. We also need to ensure that the `clocs` list is handled properly and translated into level numbers.

Given the nature of the bug and the direct error message from the failing test, we can correct the bug by identifying the level numbers for the given level names, `('A', 'a')` in this case, and using those level numbers for further processing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        try:
            level_number = index._get_level_number(loc)
            level_numbers.append(level_number)
        except ValueError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {loc} not found") from e

    rlocs = list(range(index.nlevels))
    for num in level_numbers:
        rlocs.remove(num)

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the scenario where a tuple of level names is passed, and it will use the corresponding level numbers for further processing. This should resolve the error and ensure that the correct level information is used during unstacking.

However, please note that this modification does not address handling hierarchical columns, as the comment in the original code notes. If handling hierarchical columns is a requirement, it should be addressed as a separate issue.
