I have analyzed the buggy function and identified the possible error locations. It seems that the error is likely caused by how the function is attempting to access indices and levels, which creates a KeyError in the failing test case.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the logic for accessing indices and levels is correct and that the proper MultiIndex structure is configured based on the input data.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged based on the provided function's implementation
```

This corrected version should eliminate the KeyError issue and address the problem with multi-index unstacking, as outlined in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
