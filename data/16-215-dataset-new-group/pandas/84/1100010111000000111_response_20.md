The bug occurs in the function `_unstack_multiple` due to a KeyError when we try to unstack a Series or a DataFrame with a multi-level index using a tuple to represent the specific level names to be unstacked.
The process followed by the function `_unstack_multiple` to handle a generic unstack call can deal with MultiIndexed columns, but it is not dealing with hierarchical columns.
The bug arises due to an incorrect mapping of the tuple names to their respective index, causing a KeyError, as shown in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug:
We should create logic that correctly identifies and separates the MultiIndex values and ensures that the hierarchical columns are effectively and accurately handled in cases when we want to unstack a multi-index using a tuple to represent the specific level names.

By fixing the resolution of the tuple index to the correct level of the disassembled index, this error can be avoided.

The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (tuple, list)) else i for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    ...
```

With this correction, we handle the scenario in which the `clocs` parameter refers specifically to a level in the multi-index, by using `_get_level_number` to map the tuple level names to the actual level number. This will resolve the KeyError and ensure that we properly identify and separate the MultiIndex values.
