I made some changes in the given python function based on the given issue's details and the failing test cases. Some new functions and methods needed to be added/modified. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extracting the level name(s)
    level_names = [i[0] for i in clocs]

    # Checking if only a single level name is present
    if len(level_names) == 1:
        level_names = level_names[0]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # Unstacking the Series
        unstacked = data.unstack(level_names, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Unstacking the DataFrame with hierarchical columns
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
