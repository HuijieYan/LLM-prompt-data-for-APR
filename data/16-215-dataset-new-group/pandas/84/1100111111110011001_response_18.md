### Bug analysis
The bug occurs because the function is trying to find the level index in a multi-index and is failing to do so. This leads to errors like `ValueError: The name X occurs multiple times, use a level number` and `KeyError: 'Level X not found`.

The function `_unstack_multiple` is unable to handle multi-level index columns, and the error is being generated while trying to find the level number for the `clocs` list. It's not able to correctly identify the levels and codes for hierarchical index columns.

### Bug fix strategy
The fix should involve using the existing functions provided by pandas to handle multi-level index columns. The function should identify whether the input `data` has a multi-index and handle it accordingly. Additionally, the function should use the existing pandas methods to handle the unstacking rather than implementing its own logic.

### The corrected function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i, val in enumerate(clocs):
            result = result.unstack(i, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
```

With the corrected function, we are able to detect if the dataframe has a multi-index and use pandas' native unstack method to properly handle the unstacking operation. This will fix the issues related to the multi-level index columns and the errors encountered during the unstacking process.
