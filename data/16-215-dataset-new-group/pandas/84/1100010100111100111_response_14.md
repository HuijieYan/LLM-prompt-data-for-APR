The issue arises due to a bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is trying to extract the level numbers for multi-level indexes, but it's not handling hierarchical columns correctly.

The error message clearly indicates that it encounters a KeyError when trying to retrieve the level number for a specific name.

The primary strategy to fix the bug is to handle hierarchical columns properly within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged from here
    # ...
```

In this version, we handle the case in the list comprehension where `clocs` contains tuples to properly extract the level numbers for hierarchical columns.

By fixing this issue, the function should work correctly and pass the failing tests related to the unstacking of multi-level indexes with tuple names.
