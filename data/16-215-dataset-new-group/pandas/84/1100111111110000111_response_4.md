The cause of the bug is that when `df` is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, the `df.unstack` method fails to select a correct level for unstacking when `level` is a tuple.

The issue occurs in the `_get_level_number` function of the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module, as it raises a `ValueError` when converting a tuple to a level number, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the tuple differently in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # convert string tuples to level numbers
    if all(isinstance(loc, tuple) for loc in clocs):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(loc) for loc in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This change will ensure that when the input `clocs` is a tuple, it's correctly handled to obtain the corresponding level numbers needed for unstacking from the MultiIndex. With this change, both of the failing tests should produce the expected results, resolving GitHub issue #19966.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
