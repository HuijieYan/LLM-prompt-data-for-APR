The cause of the bug is that, in the `_unstack_multiple` function, the `index._get_level_number` method is used to retrieve the levels of a MultiIndex based on the input parameter `clocs`, but `index._get_level_number` accepts level names as input, not tuples like `('A', 'a')`. This causes a KeyError when a multi-level tuple is used as the input parameter.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to correct the input type passed to the `_get_level_number` method according to the expected input type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Correcting the input type for _get_level_number
    cloc_levels = [index.get_level_values(level_name).values for level_name in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[index.names.index(level_name)] for level_name in clocs]
    ccodes = [np.asarray(pd.factorize(level)[0], dtype='int8') for level in cloc_levels]
    cnames = index.names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [index.names.index(level_name) for level_name in clocs]]

    # Rest of the function implementation remains unchanged
}
```
In the corrected version:
- The input type for `_get_level_number` is fixed to use the level name directly.
- The `_get_level_number` method is replaced with the `get_level_values` method to retrieve the level indices for a given level name.
- The level indices and corresponding codes are retrieved based on the level names, ensuring that the correct level information is obtained.
- The remaining logic for recomposing the index, handling the Series and DataFrame cases, unstacking, etc., remains unchanged.
