The `KeyError` is raised at the `_get_level_number` method located in `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` at line 753.

The cause of the bug: In the `_unstack_multiple` function, the issue is caused by the `index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs` on lines 315-317. The `clocs` represents the level name ("A") and since the multi-index has named levels, the comparison of the level names is failing.

The strategy for fixing the bug: We need to modify and normalize the level names stored in the `clocs` list before using them to extract level numbers. We should ensure that the level names are consistent with the multi-index levels in the `index` object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # normalize and validate the level names
    clocs = [i for i in clocs]  # copy the list
    clevels = index.names

    # ensure that clocs are level numbers and not names
    levels = index.names
    clocs = [
        "level {}".format(level) if level in levels else level for level in clocs
    ]

    shape = [len(index.levels[index._get_level_number(level)]) for level in clocs]
    
    # rest of the code
}
```

This corrected version addresses the inconsistent use of level names instead of level numbers by normalizing the level names and validating them against the multi-index levels in the `index` object.
