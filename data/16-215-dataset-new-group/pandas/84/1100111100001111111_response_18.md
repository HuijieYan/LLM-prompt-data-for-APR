To fix the bug, we need to address the invalid indexing of the `clocs` when it's a tuple by checking the length and accessing it correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By checking the type of `clocs` and then accessing the level numbers, we ensure that it's handled correctly for single-level and multi-level scenarios.

This should resolve the KeyError issue when trying to unstack MultiIndex with tuple names.

This fix addresses the specific issue reported on GitHub and provides a more robust approach to handling the level numbers for the unstack function.
