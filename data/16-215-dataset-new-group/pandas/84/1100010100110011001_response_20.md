## Identifying potential error locations
1. The error message indicates that the variable `level` is not being found in the list `self.names`.
2. The buggy function involves manipulating index and column level data, including getting level numbers, codes, and names.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to get the level number of a given level, but it is not finding the specified level in the list of names. This is most likely due to an issue with the way the levels are being handled or identified within the function, leading to incorrect references or indices.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to review the process of identifying level numbers and handling level data within the function, ensuring that the correct level numbers are being used and that the levels are being accessed accurately from the data structures.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=clevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=ccodes + [comp_ids],
        names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
This version of the function primarily adjusts the handling of clocs, shapes, and clevels, and ensures that the correct levels are being used for unstacking the data. This revised approach should address the issues raised in the error message and the failure cases provided.
