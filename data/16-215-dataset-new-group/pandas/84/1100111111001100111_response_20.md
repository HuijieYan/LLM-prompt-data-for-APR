Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be in the `_unstack_multiple` function of the pandas library. The function fails when trying to handle tuple names in a multi-index when calling the `pd.Series.unstack()` method. 

The issue arises when level names are provided as a tuple, which should be supported by the pandas API but leads to errors within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

To fix this bug, an update is needed in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the multi-index tuple level names correctly and remove the errors related to it. The `clocs` parameter should be handled properly, and the function logic adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # the rest of the function remains the same
```
In the updated function, the `clocs` parameter is checked to see if it's a tuple, and if so, `index._get_level_number` is called for each item inside the tuple. If the item is not a tuple, the function proceeds as usual.

This update should address the issue of handling tuple names and avoid the KeyError, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
