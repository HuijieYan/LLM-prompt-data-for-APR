The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing because it makes incorrect assumptions about the structure of the data's index and throws errors for certain input configurations. The function is unable to properly handle the multi-index columns and does not correctly stack the DataFrame as expected.

The potential error locations in the code are:
1. The formulation of `dummy_index` and `unstacked` is incorrect, causing the incorrect stacking and unstacking of the DataFrame.
2. The handling of MultiIndex columns is incorrect and leads to inappropriate functioning of the function.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the MultiIndex columns and index more accurately and appropriately to ensure the correct behavior of stacking and unstacking the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    data_unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return data_unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we are utilizing the built-in `unstack` method of the DataFrame to handle the unstacking process according to the specified column locators. This can ensure that the function correctly handles multi-index columns and indexes, allowing for the proper stacking and unstacking of the DataFrame.
