Here is the fixed version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The issue was with the handling of `clocs` in the `_get_level_number` function. The fix involved checking whether the input `i` inside the list comprehension is a tuple or not and accordingly passing it to `_get_level_number`. This helps in resolving the KeyError and ValueError issues observed in the failing test cases.
