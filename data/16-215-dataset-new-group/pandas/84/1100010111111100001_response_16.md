The issue occurs on line 320, where the function `_get_level_number()` is being called. The error message "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" suggests that the code is trying to find the index of the level 'A', but it doesn't exist.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The issue seems to be with the way the `clocs` variable is being used. It is being passed from the test as a tuple, but the function is treating it as a single value when converting it to a list of level numbers.

### Fixing the Bug
We need to modify the handling of the `clocs` variable to correctly identify the levels that need to be unstacked.

### The Corrected Function
After analyzing the code, I have corrected the `_unstack_multiple()` function as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(lvl) if isinstance(lvl, str) else lvl for lvl in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify the levels that need to be unstacked. This should fix the errors encountered in the failing tests.
