After analyzing the buggy function, we find that the main issue lies in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. When the function calls `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, it is trying to get the level number for the MultiIndex. However, the error message indicates that 'A' is not in the list, and there is also a KeyError with a similar issue, which means that the levels are not being found.

The bug seems to be caused by the `clocs` variable being a tuple of (name, level), which is incorrect when the function tries to get the level number. The input should be a number representing the level of the MultiIndex, not a tuple.

To fix the bug:
We need to modify the input parameter `clocs` to be a list of actual levels of the MultiIndex, not a tuple containing names and levels. Then, we need to use these levels to get the corresponding level numbers in the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to level numbers
    clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...

    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly get the level numbers from the MultiIndex, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
