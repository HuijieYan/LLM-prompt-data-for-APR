### BUG FIX

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameter `clocs` when it contains a tuple of level names. This is leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to get the level number from the index. 

The strategy to fix this bug would involve modifying the code that processes the `clocs` parameter to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple of level names. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Modified handling of clocs
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index.get_loc(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected function now includes handling for tuple input in the `clocs` parameter. When `clocs` is a tuple, its elements are used to get the loc of each level from the index using `index.get_loc(level)`.

This should address the `KeyError` issue and enable the function to correctly unstack the input data.

This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
