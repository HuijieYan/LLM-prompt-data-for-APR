The buggy function is intended to perform unstacking of a DataFrame, but it has several issues that lead to incorrect results. Here's an analysis of the buggy function:

1. The function `_unstack_multiple` takes the input `clocs`, which is a tuple of column location identifiers, and `data`, which is a DataFrame. It aims to perform unstacking based on the input values, and it should return the unstacked DataFrame.
2. The function then extracts various information from the input data, such as index, levels, codes, and names, to aid in unstacking.
3. It then proceeds to create new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame based on the information extracted.
4. Depending on the type of the input data, it updates the index or columns of the unstacked DataFrame accordingly.
5. The issue with the current implementation seems to be related to the computation and assignment of the new_levels, new_names, and new_columns.

Based on the analysis, the strategy for fixing the bug should involve:
- Reviewing the extraction and computation of levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame to ensure they are correctly represented.
- Ensuring that the assignment of the index or columns for the unstacked DataFrame is consistent with the type of input data.

Below is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index information
    index = data.index
    index_levels = list(index.levels)
    index_codes = list(index.codes)
    index_names = list(index.names)

    # Extract the specified column level numbers
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(col) for col in clocs]

    # Determine the levels to unstack based on extracted level numbers
    unstack_levels = [index_levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    unstack_codes = [index_codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    unstack_names = [index_names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]

    unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Update columns based on the unstacked levels
    unstacked.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(unstacked.columns.levels, names=unstack_names)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected function, we directly use the `unstack` method on the input data to achieve the desired unstacking. Then, the columns are updated based on the unstacked levels and names.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the given cases.
