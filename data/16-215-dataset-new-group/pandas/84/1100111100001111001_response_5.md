The problem with the function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be occurring at the last part where the type of the `unstacked` variable is being checked to determine whether it needs to be adjusted or if it can be directly returned. However, the condition for checking if the `unstacked` variable is a Series may be incorrect.

Based on the input parameter values and types, and the expected values and types of relevant variables, it seems that the bug is related to mishandling the Series and DataFrame types.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to revise the condition for checking if the `unstacked` variable is a Series. One way to do this would be to use the `isinstance` function and ensure it only checks for Series and not a MultiIndex.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ..
    # (previous code remains unchanged)
    # ..

    if isinstance(data, Series) and not isinstance(data.index, MultiIndex):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        # (remaining code for DataFrame types remains unchanged)
        # ..

    return unstacked
```
