The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely causing the failure of the test cases. The bug is primarily due to incorrect manipulation of the levels, codes, and names of the index during the unstacking operation. The problem is visible in the cause of the KeyError exception raised during execution.

To fix this bug, it is essential to ensure that the index-level manipulation is done correctly, and the unstacking operation is applied properly. Additionally, we need to verify proper validation and handling of multi-index data.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index
    index = data.index

    # If the data is a DataFrame with MultiIndex
    if isinstance(data, DataFrame) and isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        # If single level unstacking
        if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
            clocs = [index._get_level_number(lvl) for lvl in clocs]
            unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
        # If multiple levels unstacking
        else:
            # Create a copy of the DataFrame
            dummy = data.copy()
            # Create a MultiIndex for the unstacked DataFrame
            new_index = index.droplevel(level=clocs[0]).unique()
            # Split and unstack the data
            unstacked = dummy.unstack(level=clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
            # Update the index
            unstacked.index = new_index
    # If the data is a Series
    elif isinstance(data, Series):
        # Unstack it and set the fill_value
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        return data

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue of unstacking multi-index data with tuple-level names. The changes applied ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly along with validation for multi-index data and fill value.

Once the correct unstacking operation is applied, the `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` tests should pass without errors.
