The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is due to the incorrect manipulation of the list `clocs`. The function is trying to convert the column locations from names to integer levels. However, in Cases 1 and 2, this transformation breaks the functionality, leading to error messages like `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and `KeyError: 'Level A not found`. 

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to correctly handle the conversion of the column locations from names to integer levels.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code for the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected version uses an if-else condition to handle both single and multiple column locations correctly.
