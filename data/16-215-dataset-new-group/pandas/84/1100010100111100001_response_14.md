The problem seems to be occurring during the processing of the levels and codes of the index, when creating a new column for the unstacked DataFrame. The function does not correctly handle the MultiIndex structure when multiple levels are involved.

The cause of the bug may be that the function does not properly account for multiple levels in the index when creating the new columns for the unstacked DataFrame. This leads to incorrect reshaping and column naming issues.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly deals with the MultiIndex structure, its levels, and codes, especially when multiple levels are involved. We should also check for any discrepancies in the data columns, names, levels, and codes that might arise from the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By simplifying the function to utilize the built-in `unstack` method available for both Series and DataFrame, we can ensure that the unstacking process handles the MultiIndex structure correctly and avoids the previous issues.
