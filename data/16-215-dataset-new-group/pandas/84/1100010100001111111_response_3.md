The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it's incorrectly handling hierarchical columns, leading to KeyError when attempting to unstack the data.

The function incorrectly extracts level numbers from the index, leading to incorrect behavior for multi-level indices. This causes issues when attempting to unstack with the specified level names.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that multi-level indices are properly handled and level numbers are extracted correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clev_names = [(name,) if not isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in clocs]
    clocs = [index.names.index(name) for name in clev_names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same...

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that level names are correctly extracted and that multi-level indices are appropriately handled. This should resolve the KeyError issue when unstacking with specified level names and fix the bug with handling hierarchical columns.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle multi-level indices and perform unstacking as intended.
