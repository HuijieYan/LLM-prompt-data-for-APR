### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be caused by the `clocs` parameter, which is a tuple containing the names of the level to unstack. The function wrongly assumes that `clocs` contains the names of the levels, but the failing tests indicate that `clocs` could also contain level numbers.

When the `clocs` parameter contains both level names and level numbers, the function fails to properly handle the case, resulting in an error when accessing the level names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle both level names and level numbers in the `clocs` parameter correctly.

1. First, we need to identify the type of the elements in `clocs` to determine whether they are level names or level numbers.
2. Then, we can use the appropriate method to handle the different types of elements in `clocs` to ensure that the function works correctly in both cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    is_str = all(isinstance(item, str) for item in clocs)

    if is_str:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```
By adding a check for the type of the elements in `clocs` and converting level names to level numbers if needed, we can ensure that the function works correctly for both cases. This should fix the bug that caused the failing tests.
