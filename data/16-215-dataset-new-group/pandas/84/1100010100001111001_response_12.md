## Bug Explanation
The bug appears to be in the part of the function that deals with hierarchical columns (multiple levels of columns). In Cases 2 and 3, the bug is caused by `clocs` being a tuple with more than one element, which should indicate multiple levels of columns. However, the code does not correctly handle this situation and produces incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic that handles the hierarchical columns to correctly account for multiple levels of columns indicated by the `clocs` parameter. We should modify the code to create new MultiIndex columns according to the levels and codes obtained from the restructured data, and assign those columns to the result before returning it.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py

# this is the corrected function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Existing code continues here...

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = unstcols.levels
        new_names = [None] * len(new_levels)
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[-1]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
This corrected version of the function should handle multi-level hierarchical columns according to the input `clocs`, and produce the expected output for all provided cases.
