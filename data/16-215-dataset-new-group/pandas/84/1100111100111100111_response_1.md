### Code revision and explanation

The issue in the code is that the `index._get_level_number` method is not designed to handle tuple level names in the MultiIndex. To fix this issue, the input `level` in the `_unstack_multiple` function must be checked to see if it's a tuple or a single level name. If it's a tuple, the level names should be extracted and converted into corresponding level numbers for unstacking. 

A new helper function `get_level_numbers` can be created for this purpose. This function will accept the `index` and a `level` (which can be a tuple or a single level name), and return the corresponding level numbers. Then, the `_unstack_multiple` function can use this helper to calculate the `clocs` if required. 

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function will be able to handle both single level names and tuple level names, leading to a successful unstack operation for MultiIndex with tuple level names.

### Corrected code

```python
def get_level_numbers(index, level):
    # If level is a tuple, convert level names to level numbers
    if isinstance(level, tuple):
        return [index._get_level_number(i) for i in level]
    else:
        return [index._get_level_number(level)]

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = get_level_numbers(index, clocs)  # Call the helper function to get level numbers

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
}
```

With this change, the `_unstack_multiple` is updated to handle both single level names and tuple level names when unstacking MultiIndex columns. This should resolve the KeyError issue faced during unstacking operations on MultiIndex with tuple level names.
