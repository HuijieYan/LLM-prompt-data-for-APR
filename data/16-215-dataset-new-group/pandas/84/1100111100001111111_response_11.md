The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to occur due to an issue with the processing of the `clocs` input. When unstacking a multi-index DataFrame, the function is unable to determine the level numbers correctly, leading to errors.

Based on the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, especially around the handling of multi-index data, we should focus on updating the logic related to handling multi-index levels and codes.

Given this information and the GitHub issue, we should modify the function to ensure that it can correctly determine the level numbers and handle the unstacking of multi-index DataFrames with tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [i if isinstance(i, int) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged.
    # ...
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, the `clocs` handling logic has been updated. When the index is a `MultiIndex`, it checks if the input `clocs` elements are instances of a tuple, and if so, it retrieves the level number using `_get_level_number`. This additional check and handling should address the issue described in the GitHub report and handle the unstacking of multi-index DataFrames with tuple names.

With these changes, the corrected function should now return the expected results and resolve the issue outlined in the GitHub report.
