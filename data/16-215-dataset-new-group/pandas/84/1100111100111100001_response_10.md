Looking at the failing test cases and the runtime values of the input parameters and variables inside the buggy function, it seems like the issue is with the `_get_level_number` and the subsequent usage of the `clocs` variable. The error message shows that the levels from the `clocs` are not found in the `index.names` which suggests that the `clocs` variable is not being processed correctly.

It appears that the `clocs` variable is being treated as nested tuples in the failing test cases, but the buggy function is not handling this correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle the nested tuples within the `clocs` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = (*clocs,)  # Unpacking the nested tuple

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # ... rest of the function
```

By adding the check for `clocs` being a tuple and then unpacking it, we can fix the bug related to the handling of nested tuples. This should address the issue with the failing test cases.

Please note that the actual changes required might be more extensive, and this fix specifically addresses the nested tuple issue mentioned in the failing test cases. Testing the complete function is required to ensure that all edge cases are handled correctly.
