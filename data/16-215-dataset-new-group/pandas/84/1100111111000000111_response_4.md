The `KeyError` in the GitHub issue explanation is pointing to the line in the code where the error is originating. The KeyError occurs when attempting to access a MultiIndex level that does not exist.

In the `_unstack_multiple` function, the `clocs` array is derived from `index._get_level_number(i)` for i in `clocs`. If a level name in `clocs` is not found in the index, a KeyError will be raised.

The error in the code is due to the way that `clocs` is being derived and subsequently used to access the MultiIndex level. The raised error is due to the confusion between the use of tuple names being accessed as a single label.

A strategy to fix this issue is to modify the way the MultiIndex levels are accessed to correctly handle tuple names in a MultiIndex. Additionally, a check for the existence of the MultiIndex level before attempting to unstack it can be added.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            # Handling the tuple names
            loc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in loc]
            cloc_numbers.append(loc_numbers)
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                cloc_numbers = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in cloc_numbers]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
After applying these modifications, the provided test cases for the MultiIndex unstack method are expected to pass, and the issue on GitHub should be resolved.
