The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` appears to be trying to unstack a DataFrame 'data' based on the 'clocs' input, which represents the hierarchical columns for 'data' by their names.

### Error Identification:
- The function is not correctly using the input 'clocs' to unstack the DataFrame 'data'.
- The function is failing to appropriately handle hierarchical columns when dealing with MultiIndex.

### Bug:
The bug appears to stem from incorrect handling of the column locations ('clocs') when the input DataFrame has hierarchical columns.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly identify the levels of the hierarchical columns based on 'clocs'.
2. Use the identified levels of the columns to create a dummy index for the unstacked DataFrame.
3. Correctly reconstruct the unstacked DataFrame based on the original data using the new levels and codes from the unstacking process.
4. Return the unstacked DataFrame.

### Corrected Function:
Based on the identified bug and fix strategy, here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    levels = data.columns
    cnames = [levels[x] for x in clocs]
    rnames = [x for x in levels if x not in cnames]
    
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels([*rnames, *cnames])
    
    return unstacked
```
In this corrected version, the function corrects handles the unstacking process based on the 'clocs' input and correctly reconstructs the unstacked DataFrame with the right levels and codes.
