The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` method is not correctly handling the situation when the level specified by the method is a tuple. Instead of treating the tuple as a single unit, the method considers it as separate elements resulting in a 'Level A not found' error. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the situation when a tuple is passed to the `_get_level_number` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [(index._get_level_number(i[0]), i[1]) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    
    return unstacked
```

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now accurately resolve the level names and indices when the input to the `_get_level_number` method is a tuple.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function is expected to pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
