The provided function `_unstack_multiple` has a bug that prevents it from performing the unstacking operation correctly. The bug stems from a failure to properly work with hierarchical columns. This results in the unstack operation raising a KeyError when attempting to unstack a level specified with a tuple name.

The problematic segment of code is when the function tries to handle the hierarchical column. It incorrectly attempts to access the levels of the hierarchical index without taking into account the tuple-related mixing of names. This results in an error and prevents the unstacking operation from completing successfully.

To fix this bug, you will need to refine the logic of handling hierarchical indexes and properly recast the column levels when unstacking a dataframe.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Ensure that clocs is a list
    clocs = [clocs] if not isinstance(clocs, list) else clocs

    # Extract index, data, and column names
    index = data.index
    columns = data.columns
    
    # Get the level numbers of the columns to unstack
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    # Unstack the data and adjust column names as needed
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack(level=-1, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we handle tuple names correctly and ensure that the unstacking operation is performed appropriately. This should resolve the KeyError and successfully complete the unstacking operation.

This fix addresses the issue where the unstack fails with a KeyError when trying to handle a tuple name in a MultiIndex for a Series. The corrected function arranges the columns of the DataFrame correctly when unstacking a level via the _unstack_multiple function.
