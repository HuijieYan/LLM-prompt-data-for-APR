## Issues
The function `_unstack_multiple` is not properly handling the cases when there is a MultiIndex in the data. The function is supposed to unstack the index, but it seems to have issues while dealing with MultiIndex and hierarchical columns.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. When dealing with MultiIndex, the function should appropriately handle grouping and unstacking.
2. Properly reconstruct the new index and column levels and codes when unstacking.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
The corrected function uses the `unstack` method directly on the data, passing the `clocs` and `fill_value` parameters. This will appropriately handle both single Index and MultiIndex cases.

The above correction assumes that the portion of the code related to MultiIndex and hierarchical columns is causing the bug. If that's not the case, further analysis and debugging will be required.
