## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the conversion of the tuple index names to integers using the `_get_level_number(i)` method. This results in a `KeyError` because the conversion expects the level `('A', 'a')` to be found within the index, which is not the case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle the hierarchical index with tuple names. The goal is to ensure that the tuple names are utilized as expected without causing a `KeyError`.

## The Corrected Code
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unused_index = data.index
    rlocs = [unused_index.nlevels]  # yield all rlocs not included in clocs

    clevels = [unused_index.get_level_values(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    group_index = get_group_index(clevels, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=clevels + [obs_ids],
                             codes=comp_ids + [np.arange(len(obs_ids))],
                             names=list(unused_index.names) + ['__placeholder__'],
                             verify_integrity=False)

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack('__placeholder__', fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The correction involves creating `clevels` with the actual index values from the corresponding levels specified by `clocs`, followed by the recalculation of `comp_ids` and `obs_ids`. Subsequently, the `dummy_index` is formed using these recalculated values, and the unstacking process is performed as before.

This corrected code should now properly handle the index with tuple names, resolving the `KeyError` issue and providing the expected unstacked result.
