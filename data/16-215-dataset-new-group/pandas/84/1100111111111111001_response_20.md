### Revision of the buggy function

After analyzing the failing tests and comparing the expected values with the actual values during the executions, I have identified some issues in the `_unstack_multiple` function that need to be corrected. Below is the revised version of the function along with a brief summary of the changes made.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [[]] * len(clevels)

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, [len(x) for x in clevels], sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, [len(x) for x in clevels], ccodes, xnull=False)

    if not rlocs:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = obs_ids
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = [None] + [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        unstcols = unstacked.index
        new_levels = [clevels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [None] + [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

Summary of Changes Made:
1. Replaced `if rlocs == []` with `if not rlocs` for better readability.
2. Simplified the creation of `ccodes` by initializing it with an empty list.
3. Changed the calculation of `dummy_index` for better handling when `rlocs` is empty.
4. Updated the code to handle the case where the data is not a Series.
5. Fully revised the process of defining `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes` for better consistency and correctness.

These changes are made to ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function handles the input cases accurately and produces the expected output for the provided failing tests.
