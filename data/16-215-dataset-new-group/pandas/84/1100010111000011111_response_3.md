## The Bug

The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function in the 'pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py' file. When it is used to unstack a multi-index dataframe, an error occurs due to the way the function is handling the processing of the multi-index levels. The error is shown when attempting to unstack a multi-index by a tuple name.

## Bug Location

The issue is likely to be occurring in the section of the code where clocs are handled. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the case when clocs are represented by tuple names in the input multi-index structure. This leads to the internal functions trying to handle the unstacked multi-index in a way that doesn't properly process the levels and codes from the index.

## Cause of Bug

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tuple names (`clocs`) in the multi-index as observed in the failing test and the error message from the GitHub issue. Specifically, the code is not extracting the level numbers correctly when the clocs are tuple names, leading to a failure in the unstacking process. 

## Suggested Fix

To fix this bug, we will need to ensure that the clocs are correctly processed based on whether they are represented as integer level numbers or tuple names in the multi-index. If they are tuple names, we should convert them to the respective level numbers before processing the multi-index.

## The Corrected Function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]  # Convert tuple names to level numbers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... Rest of the code remains same
```
