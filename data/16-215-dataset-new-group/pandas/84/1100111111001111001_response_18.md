The cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of the `clocs` parameter and its relationship with other variables, leading to incorrect manipulation of the `unstacked` variable. This is causing the function to return unexpected results, resulting in failing tests.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic and manipulation of the `clocs` parameter and its impact on the subsequent operations within the function. It may also involve validating the nested conditions for unstacking data and ensuring that the transformation aligns with the expected behavior for MultiIndex and DataFrame structures.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    if len(clocs) == index.nlevels:
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    return unstacked.unstack(clocs[1], fill_value=fill_value)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues related to the incorrect handling of the `clocs` parameter and its impact on the unstacking operation. It validates the length of `clocs` and checks for the number of levels in the MultiIndex before applying the unstacking operation accordingly. I hope this helps to fix the bug and pass the failing tests.
