The error occurs due to an issue when looking up the index level number in the `MultiIndex`. Within the `_unstack_multiple` function, the `_get_level_number` method is used to get the level numbers from the `MultiIndex`. However, the method itself is not implemented properly and it causes errors while handling tuple names in MultiIndex.

The issue has been raised on GitHub with the title "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The error message provided in the issue also shows the same problem, indicating the KeyError while searching for the level in the MultiIndex.

The fix for this issue can be done by modifying the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class, so that it can correctly handle the tuple names in MultiIndex. This will resolve the KeyError and allow the unstack operation to work correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) and any(isinstance(i, tuple) for i in index.names):
        clocs = [list(index.names).index(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By using the corrected version of `_unstack_multiple`, the issue with the failing test and error in the GitHub issue will be resolved. This will allow the unstack operation to work correctly with MultiIndex having tuple names.
