The bug in the `_unstack_multiple()` function in `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` arises from an error in handling hierarchical columns when using the MultiIndex `unstack` method. When we check the test that fails (`test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex`), it shows that the bug occurs when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

The main cause of the bug arises due to the level names not being handled correctly, which results in a KeyError or ValueError when attempting to unstack the MultiIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of hierarchical columns before unstacking the data. As part of the fix, the `clocs` parameter and the corresponding code logic needs to be updated to correctly handle the hierarchical columns more effectively.

Here is a corrected version of `_unstack_multiple()` that should fix the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if hasattr(index, '_get_level_number') else
             index.names.index(i) if i in index.names else None for i in clocs]

    if None in clocs:
        raise ValueError('Invalid level name in clocs')

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    ...

    // Rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

In this corrected version of the function, the clocs parameter now handles both level numbers and level names. It first checks if there is a built-in `_get_level_number` method in the index, then it falls back to index.names.index to get the level number. If neither method succeeds, it raises a ValueError. Additionally, we are ensuring that None is not present in the `clocs` list to avoid errors.

This version should resolve the issue by correctly handling hierarchical columns before unstacking, thereby matching the level names with the levels in the MultiIndex.

This corrected version should fix the bug and resolve the GitHub issue.
