To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, it's necessary to correct the way the `clocs` variable is handled and used to get the level number from the index. 

The current implementation is causing problems when a tuple of names is provided as the `clocs` parameter, as exposed by the failing tests and the associated GitHub issue. It's trying to use the level names directly as index levels, which doesn't work properly.

The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, str) else c for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # The rest of the function implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, the `clocs` variable is first checked to determine if the elements are strings or integers. If an element in `clocs` is a string, it means it represents the name of a level, so the function uses the `_get_level_number` method to get its corresponding level number. If it's already an integer, it's used directly. This allows the function to handle both types of input correctly.

By implementing this correction, the function should now work properly with the provided inputs and solve the issue explained in the failing test and GitHub issue.
