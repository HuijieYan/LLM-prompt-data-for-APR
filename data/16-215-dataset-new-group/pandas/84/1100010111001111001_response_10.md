The issue with the buggy function appears to be with the unstacking process, as the function is designed to unstack the data based on the values provided in the `clocs` parameter. However, the implementation of unstacking logic seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected output.

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect construction of the intermediate variables that define the unstacked DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the logic for unstacking the DataFrame needs to be revised to ensure that the unstacked DataFrame is constructed correctly. Additionally, the column names, index names, and levels need to be updated according to the expected values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if index.names[i] not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly unstack the DataFrame based on the specified `clocs` and produce the expected output, resolving the bug.
