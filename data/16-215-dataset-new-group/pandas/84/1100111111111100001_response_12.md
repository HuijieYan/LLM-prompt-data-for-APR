The issue appears to stem from the `clocs` variable being assigned incorrect values. It looks like the `MultiIndex` object `index` is being used to extract level numbers, but this is not the correct way to do it, which is causing the function to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should use the `MultiIndex` object `data.columns` instead of `index` to extract the level numbers. This will ensure that the correct level numbers are used to unstack the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers from column MultiIndex
    clevels = [data.columns._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now return correct results and pass the failing tests.
