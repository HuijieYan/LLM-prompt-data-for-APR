## The bug's cause
The bug is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function trying to access a level of the index that is not present in a MultiIndex.

The issue stems from the `clocs` variable where there's no proper check to ensure whether a level exists in the MultiIndex. The bug results from how the `clocs` list is used to access levels in the `index` object.

## A strategy for fixing the bug
The fix involves checking whether each level in `clocs` is a valid level in the `index` object before proceeding with further computations.

## The corrected function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the number of levels in the index
    nlevels = data.index.nlevels

    # Use the list comprehension to ensure each level in clocs is a valid level in the MultiIndex
    clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) if (isinstance(i, str) and i in data.index.names) else i for i in clocs]

    # Remove the invalid levels from clocs
    clocs = [i for i in clocs if isinstance(i, int)]

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code stays the same
}
```

With the added checks to make sure each level in `clocs` exists in the `index` object, we can mitigate the KeyError issues reported in the GitHub issue.
