The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the incorrect handling of hierarchical columns. The function is failing for unstacking when the columns are MultiIndexed and the unstack variable involves tuple names. This specific error is due to how the level number is obtained in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The `_get_level_number` method returns the level number for the multi-index based on the provided level. In case of failure, it should raise a KeyError, but the incorrect handling of tuple-based names for levels causes a ValueError instead of a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can reformulate the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the unstacking of hierarchical columns with specific attention to scenario involving tuple-based names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not (isinstance(i, tuple) and all([name in index.names for name in i])) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains the same...
```

In the corrected version, `clocs` list is checked for tuple-based names, and if all names in the tuple exist in the index, we retain the tuple as it is, otherwise we get the level number. This modification will prevent failing scenarios like the one described in the failing tests and fix the bug associated with unstacking MultiIndexed dataframes with tuple names.
