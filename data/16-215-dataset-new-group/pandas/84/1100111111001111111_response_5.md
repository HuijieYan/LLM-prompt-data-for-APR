Given the reported bug that the MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with a KeyError, it appears that the issue occurs when trying to use the unstack functionality on a Series with MultiIndex index and tuple names. This triggers a ValueError and a subsequent KeyError when the level number and the level itself are sought in the indexes and not found. 

To address this, we need to correct the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle the case when `clocs` and `rlocs` - column and row locations in the index - are not empty. 

The MultiIndex-related variables and operations within the `_unstack_multiple` function are not working correctly for the given test cases. The function is designed to work with multi-level indices but is failing in these particular cases. 

There are multiple bugs in the `_unstack_multiple` function:
1. The treatment of 'rlocs' and the construction of 'dummy_index' is incorrect when `rlocs` is not empty.
2. The handling of Series data within the function is broken.

A strategy to fix the bug could include the following steps:
1. Identify and isolate the specific code blocks within the `_unstack_multiple` function that are problematic for the given failing test cases.
2. Make necessary changes to correctly handle the multi-level indices, including 'rlocs', 'dummy_index', and data types like Series.
3. Ensure that the changes are made in such a way that the function can handle the given test cases without errors and that the data and index structures are correctly reformatted according to the expected output.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Assume that 'data' input parameter is either Series or DataFrame
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(index, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        # Construct a new index with 'obs_ids' and 'comp_ids'
        shape = [len(index.levels[i]) for i in clocs]  
        group_index = get_group_index([index.codes[i] for i in clocs], shape, sort=False, xnull=False)  
        comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
        
        # Reconstruct the codes
        recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, [index.codes[i] for i in clocs], xnull=False)
        
        # Construct the dummy index containing the new levels and recons_codes
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=[index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + [obs_ids], 
                                 codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [recons_codes[0]], 
                                 names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"], 
                                 verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = dummy_index.levels
        new_names = dummy_index.names
        new_codes = dummy_index.codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + dummy_index.levels
        new_names = [None] + dummy_index.names
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

With the corrected version, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to correctly handle the multi-level indices, the construction of dummy indices, and gracefully handle data types like Series. This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and address the reported GitHub Issue.
