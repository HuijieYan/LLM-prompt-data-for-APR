The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to occur when trying to determine the level number of a specific index. This results in a `KeyError` or a `ValueError` because the level is not found. The problem is associated with the variable `clocs`, which seems to be calculated incorrectly.

The issue was reported on GitHub under the title "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" and it is reproducible when attempting to use the unstack function on a MultiIndex Series.

To address this issue, potential strategies could include checking the calculations of the `clocs` variable to ensure it is correctly determined before proceeding with the unstack operation.

Based on the issue description and the variables involved, the correct implementation should handle hierarchical columns properly and determine the level number correctly without causing KeyError or ValueError.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function body remains the same
```

This corrected implementation checks if the given `clocs` value is an instance of an integer. If it is not, it retrieves the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`. This should resolve the issues related to determining the level number correctly.
