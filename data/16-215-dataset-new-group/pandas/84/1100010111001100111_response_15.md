I've carefully reviewed the code for the function `_unstack_multiple`. It appears that the issues are due to the `_unstack_multiple` function failing to properly handle unstacking operations on MultiIndex objects. The key problem occurs in the process of transforming the input data and indices for unstacking, leading to errors when trying to access levels and keys.

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the way hierarchically indexed data is handled. Specifically, you should consider restructuring the code to a more robust and clearer format. A good approach to this is by utilizing Pandas's built-in support for multi-index manipulation.

For the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function, please see the code below. The modifications have been made to handle the unstacking operation properly, avoiding errors that were present in the original code.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    clocs = list(clocs)  # Ensure clocs is a list

    df = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)  # Unstack the first level

    for level in clocs[1:]:
        df = df.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)  # Unstack subsequent levels

    return df
```

This corrected implementation should effectively handle the unstacking operation on MultiIndex data, resolving the issues that caused the failing test cases. After applying this fix, the function should properly process the input data and output the expected results for all test cases.

I hope this solution resolves the bug and addresses the GitHub issue related to the unstacking operation on MultiIndex objects. Let me know if you need further assistance!
