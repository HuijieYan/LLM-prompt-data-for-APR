The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None)`. It is called by `unstack(obj, level, fill_value=None)` function. The issue discussed in the GitHub issue is related to using `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` on a MultiIndexed Series object `s` and it is throwing a `KeyError` exception.

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it does not correctly handle hierarchical columns yet, and the `index._get_level_number(i)` call tries to retrieve the level number for non-existing levels, leading to the KeyError when unstack is invoked on the Series.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to correctly handle the hierarchical columns and correctly resolve the level numbers. The corrected version of `_unstack_multiple` should handle the MultiIndexed columns correctly and use the behavior that is expected by the `unstack` call on a Series object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if not clocs:  # An empty list of clocs might lead to other issues, so we'll handle it differently
        return data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value) if isinstance(data, Series) else data.unstack()

    unstack_kwargs = {"level": clocs, "fill_value": fill_value}

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        return data.unstack(**unstack_kwargs)
    else:
        return data.unstack(**unstack_kwargs)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case when clocs is empty separately to avoid unnecessary complexity. We then use `unstack` method with the appropriate arguments based on the input to handle the unstacking of the data properly depending on whether it is a Series or another type of data structure.
