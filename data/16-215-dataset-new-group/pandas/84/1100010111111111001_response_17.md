## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to an error in the calculation of various indices and levels. This results in the improper unstacking of the data, leading to an incorrect output.

The error message indicates that the value `'A'` is not found in the list of names, which suggests an issue with the level number calculation.

The incorrect output values indicate that the unstacking process is not being performed correctly, leading to an invalid result.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Identify the logic responsible for calculating the indices and levels for unstacking the data.
2. Ensure that the correct levels and indices are used to perform the unstacking operation.
3. Verify the unstacking process to ensure that the resulting DataFrame matches the expected output.
4. Modify the code as needed to properly unstack the multi-indexed DataFrame.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Calculate the index
    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, assign a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(index)
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(
            index.to_flat_index(), names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ['__placeholder__']
        )

    # Unstack the data
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Update the columns and index of the unstacked frame
    new_columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels(clocs)
    new_index = dummy_index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = unstacked.reindex(index=new_index)
    else:
        unstacked = unstacked.reindex(columns=new_columns, index=new_index)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function ensures that the unstacking process is performed accurately, using the correct indices and levels to produce the expected output.
