## The problem:

The `_get_level_number` function in the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module is raising a `ValueError` because it is unable to find the level name specified in the code of the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The `_unstack_multiple` function has a condition where it checks if `clocs` is an empty list, it returns the `data`. However, this check might not be sufficient. There are various operations being performed on `clocs` and `index`, which might lead to the failure.

## The solution:

1. Ensure that the code handles the case where `clocs` is an empty list correctly and returns the `data` in that scenario.
2. Verify that the operations being performed on `clocs` and `index` are valid and do not lead to errors.
3. Modify the code to use a proper strategy to handle data with multi-level indexing.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    # ... rest of the code ...
```

The above correction ensures that if `clocs` is an empty list, the function immediately returns `data` without performing any further operations. This should help avoid the `ValueError` raised by `_get_level_number`.
