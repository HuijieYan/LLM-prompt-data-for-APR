Based on the failing tests and the raised GitHub issue, it appears that the `_unstack_multiple` function in the pandas core module `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` is failing due to its inability to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names correctly. The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` in the file `pandas/tests/frame/test_reshape.py` specifically address this issue.

The error messages indicate that 'A' is not found in the list, and level 'A' is not found, both coming from `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py`. The provided test cases, together with the corresponding error messages, reflect that the `_get_level_number` function within the MultiIndex class is encountering issues associated with the Tuple names within the MultiIndexes.

To fix this bug, you can directly use the `unstack` method which can handle the unstacking of both single and multi-index data. You need to replace the `_unstack_multiple` function with the direct use of `unstack` method of the given DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        result = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        result = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

By utilizing the built-in `unstack` method of the DataFrame or Series object, we can bypass the low-level operations required for unstacking and ensure that the method properly handles both single and multi-level indices, as demonstrated in the failing tests.

This corrected version should resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to this bug.
