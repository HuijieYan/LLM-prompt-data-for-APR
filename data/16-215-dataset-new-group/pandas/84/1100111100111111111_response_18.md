## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect identification of the levels and the level number when using a MultiIndex with tuple names during the unstacking process. The code needs to correctly identify the levels and the level number based on the input tuple names.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` function should handle exceptions more appropriately and identify tuple names correctly. The `_unstack_multiple` function should also ensure proper handling of MultiIndexes with tuple names during the unstacking process.

## Buggy Function Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple) and all(isinstance(item, str) for item in level):
        for i, l in enumerate(self.names):
            if level == l:
                return i
        raise ValueError(f"Level {level} not found")
    elif not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
    else:
        try:
            return self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")


def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple) and all(isinstance(item, tuple) for item in clocs):
        clocs = [_get_level_number(data.index, i) for i in clocs]
    elif not isinstance(clocs, (list, int)):
        clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same up to the return statement
    # ...
```

This corrected version checks if the input `clocs` is a tuple and whether all items inside the tuple are also tuples. If so, it calls the modified `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names. Otherwise, it carries out the operation accordingly.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and accommodate the use of tuple names correctly when performing the unstack operation on a MultiIndex.
