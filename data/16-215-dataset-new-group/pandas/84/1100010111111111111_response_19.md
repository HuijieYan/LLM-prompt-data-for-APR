I will provide the suggested strategy for fixing the bug and then the corrected version of the function.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is due to an issue with the `clocs` variable. It appears that `clocs` is not being correctly converted to level numbers when it is a tuple of names. This causes an exception when trying to unpack the levels later in the function. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic that converts `clocs` to level numbers and ensure that it handles both single and multiple levels correctly.

#### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected version specifically checks if the `clocs` variable is a tuple. If it is, it iterates through each item in the tuple, otherwise, it directly gets the level number. This ensures that both single and multiple levels are handled correctly, addressing the issue that caused the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
