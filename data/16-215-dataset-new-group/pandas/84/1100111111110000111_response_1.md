The cause of the bug: 
The error is due to the function `_get_level_number` within the MultiIndex class in the pandas library. This function is supposed to return the index of the given level name. However, it seems that this function doesn't handle tuple names as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly process the provided `clocs`, which may contain multiple levels of index names.

Based on the error messages and the failing tests, we can identify the potential location of the bug as follows:
- The `clocs` argument that is passed to `_unstack_multiple` is expected to contain a level name, which may sometimes be a tuple of names for MultiIndex data structures.
- The code attempts to call `_get_level_number` on each element of `clocs`, potentially causing the error in cases where `clocs` contain a tuple of names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    # New code
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
    # ...
```

The new code first checks if the index is a MultiIndex and if `clocs` contains a tuple. If so, it retrieves the index of the tuple using `index.names.index(i)` instead of directly calling `_get_level_number`.

This modification allows the function to handle tuple names correctly when unstacking the data, and it should resolve the issue with unstacking tuple names from MultiIndex objects.

After making these changes, the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function should fix the previously reported issue.
