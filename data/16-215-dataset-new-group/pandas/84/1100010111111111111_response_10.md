The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the processing of the `clocs` variable, which is a tuple. It appears that when the function attempts to determine the level number from the tuple, it throws a `ValueError` and a subsequent `KeyError`.

The cause of the error is likely associated with how the `clocs` tuple is processed during the unstacking operation. The `clocs` tuple is used to extract the relevant level numbers, and it seems that the current implementation fails to handle the tuple names correctly.

To fix this bug, we can update the processing of the `clocs` variable to account for tuple names and appropriately extract level numbers. This should prevent the `KeyError` from being thrown and ensure that the unstacking operation proceeds as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clevels = index.get_level_values(clocs[0]).unique()
    ccodes = [index.get_level_values(c).codes for c in clocs]
    cnames = [index.get_level_values(c).name for c in clocs]
    
    new_columns = data.columns.rename(list(data.columns.names[:len(clocs)]) + cnames)
    result = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value).reorder_levels(new_columns)

    return result
```

This updated version should provide a solution to the unstacking operation and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread. With these changes, the function should handle tuple names in multiindex unstacking correctly and resolve the reported KeyError.
