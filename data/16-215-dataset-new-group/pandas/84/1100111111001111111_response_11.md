The cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from a logical error in the indexing and unstacking data that contain a MultiIndex with tuple names. This leads to issues with handling and unstacking the hierarchical indices properly.

To fix the bug, revisions need to be made within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically when handling hierarchical column data and performing the unstacking operation. Additionally, the `unstack` function called inside `_unstack_multiple` also needs to be handled properly to resolve the issues described in the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs != []:
        data = data.swaplevel(i=rlocs[0], j=-1)

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    return unstacked
```

The revised `_unstack_multiple` function ensures that the correct level indexing and unstacking process is performed, resolving the issues with handling tuple names and nested indices.

This updated version should pass the failing tests and provide the expected input/output values, satisfying the GitHub issue details.
