The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing it to fail for the provided test cases. The issue seems to be related to unstacking the DataFrame by multiple levels within a MultiIndex on columns. The process of identifying level numbers and extracting codes from the index is not functioning as expected, leading to errors.

The cause of the bug is identified as the data's MultiIndex structure not being handled appropriately, leading to errors during the unstacking process. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the process of identifying and extracting the level numbers and codes from the MultiIndex. It would involve assessing the structure of the MultiIndex and making sure that the necessary information for unstacking is obtained correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = []
    for val in clocs:
        if isinstance(val, tuple):
            clevels.extend(index.levels[index.names.index(val)])
        else:
            clevels.extend(index.levels[val])

    rlevels = []
    for val in rlocs:
        rlevels.extend(index.levels[val])

    group_index = get_group_index(index.codes._all(), shape=len(rlocs), sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape=len(clocs), codes=index.codes._all(), xnull=False)

    if not rlocs:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=[rlevels, obs_ids],
            codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [comp_ids],
            names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [clevels]
        new_names = [clocs]
        new_codes = [recons_codes]
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                if isinstance(val, tuple):
                    val = index.names.index(val)
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                if i == len(clocs) - 1:
                    cols = result.columns
            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns

        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0], *clevels]
        new_names = [data.columns.name, *clocs]
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0], *recons_codes]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrections made to the function are aimed at the following:
- Correctly identifying the required level numbers and codes from the MultiIndex
- Handling the unstacking process for both Series and DataFrames in a more reliable manner
- Ensuring the correct levels, names, and codes are attributed to the unstacked result

These modifications should address the issues with the unstacking process and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

Please ensure to test this corrected function with the provided failing test cases to validate its functionality.
