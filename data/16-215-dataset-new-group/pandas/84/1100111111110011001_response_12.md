#### The cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `clocs` variable, which is used to get the level number. When `clocs` is passed to the function, the buggy section of the code iterates over each element in `clocs` and attempts to retrieve the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`. The issue arises because `clocs` contains a tuple with multi-index levels which causes the `index._get_level_number(i)` to fail.

#### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to address the incorrect handling of `clocs` by handling the case when `clocs` contains a tuple with multi-index levels. We should ensure that the code can handle multi-level indices.

#### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Identify potential multi-index and pass the index level names directly to the clocs
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) and isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = index.names.index(clocs)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

Note: The key change in the corrected version is identifying the potential multi-index and then passing the index level names directly to the clocs. This will allow the function to handle multi-level indices correctly.
