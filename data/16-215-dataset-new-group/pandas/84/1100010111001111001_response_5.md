The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails the given test cases. After analyzing the code and the failing test cases, the cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle multi-level indices when performing the unstack operation. This leads to incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the logic for handling multi-level indices and unstacking operations. This can be achieved by accurately determining the levels, codes, names, and index structures, and then performing the unstack operation while considering the multi-level properties of the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    new_names = list(index.names)
    new_levels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    new_codes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]

    # For each level in clocs, perform unstack
    for level in clocs:
        clevels = index.levels[level]
        ccodes = index.codes[level]

        for rloc in rlocs:
            new_levels.append(index.levels[rloc])
            new_codes.append(index.codes[rloc])
            new_names.append(index.names[rloc])

        # Create the unstacked DataFrame
        unstacked = data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)

        # If the unstacked object is a Series, convert it to a DataFrame
        if isinstance(unstacked, pd.Series):
            unstacked = unstacked.to_frame()

        # Reconstruct the index after unstacking
        new_index = pd.MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels,
            codes=new_codes,
            names=new_names,
            verify_integrity=False
        )

        # Set the new index for the unstacked DataFrame
        unstacked.index = new_index

        # Modify the levels, names, and codes for the subsequent unstacking
        new_levels = [unstacked.index.levels[i] for i in range(len(clocs))]
        new_codes = [unstacked.index.codes[i] for i in range(len(clocs))]
        new_names = list(unstacked.index.names)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function iterates over the levels in `clocs`, performs unstacking, and correctly reconstructs the multi-level index after each unstack operation. This should address the issue of incorrect reshaping and ensure that the function produces the expected output for the given test cases.
