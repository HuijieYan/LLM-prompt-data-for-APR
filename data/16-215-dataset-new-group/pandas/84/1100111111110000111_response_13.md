Based on the detailed description in the GitHub issue and the failing tests, the bug appears to be caused by the handling of MultiIndex when unstacking with tuple names. The failing test cases describe unstacking using different levels of the MultiIndex with tuple names, and the error messages consistently show that the column or level names are not being found in the MultiIndex.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` primarily performs index manipulation operations for unstacking. The cause of the bug is likely related to how levels and column names are being identified and managed in this function. It appears that the function is not correctly handling tuple names in the MultiIndex.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully handling the identification of levels and column names for the MultiIndex, especially when tuple names are involved. The extraction of levels and codes from the MultiIndex may also need special treatment to handle tuple names correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs[0], (tuple, list)):
        # Tuple names are involved
        clocs = [(index._get_level_number(i), i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [(index._get_level_number(i), index.names[i]) for i in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, `clocs` are inspected to detect whether tuple names are involved. If the first element of `clocs` is a tuple or a list, then the individual elements of the tuples are passed to `_get_level_number` along with the tuple itself. Otherwise, the usual treatment of level numbers and names is applied. By handling the different cases separately, this correction aims to fix the bug related to unstacking with tuple names in MultiIndex.
