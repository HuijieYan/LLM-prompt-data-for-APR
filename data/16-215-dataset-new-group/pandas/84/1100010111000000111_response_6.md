The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function as it fails to properly handle a MultiIndex with tuple names when performing an unstack operation. Specifically, the bug occurs when trying to extract the level number for the specified levels. This causes an error when attempting to handle MultiIndex with tuple names, resulting in a KeyError.

This bug arises from the fact that when `clocs` contains tuple names, the function attempts to extract the corresponding level number. However, the original implementation is not able to correctly handle the case where `clocs` contains tuple names in a MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, we should modify the implementation to correctly handle the scenario where `clocs` contains tuple names in a MultiIndex. This involves extracting the level numbers of tuple names and processing them appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else level for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... (rest of the implementation remains unchanged)
```

The proposed fix includes checking each item in `clocs` to determine if it's a tuple name or not. If it's a tuple name, we use `index._get_level_number(level)` to get the level number, otherwise, we use the value as is.

This modified implementation ensures that the function correctly handles the scenario where `clocs` contains tuple names within a MultiIndex, allowing it to pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
