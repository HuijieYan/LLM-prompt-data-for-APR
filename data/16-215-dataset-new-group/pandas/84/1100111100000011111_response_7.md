The cause of the bug is that the `clocs` list is being used to index into a MultiIndex `index` without accounting for the possibility that a single label is actually a tuple of labels, causing the `index._get_level_number(i)` to throw a KeyError. Additionally, the code doesn't deal with hierarchical columns, and the conditions for hierarchical columns handling aren't clear. This leads the function to encounter errors when trying to parse and handle data with hierarchical columns. 

To fix the bug, the logic for handling hierarchical columns should be clearly defined and implemented in the function's code. In addition, we need to handle the case where the list of column locations `clocs` contains tuples. The function should implement a way to map these tuples to a unique identifier that can be used to index the MultiIndex `index`. The handling of hierarchical columns should be performed earlier in the function, before we proceed to make use of the `clocs` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handling hierarchical columns
    col_is_multilevel = isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex)
    if col_is_multilevel:
        for i, val in enumerate(clocs):
            unstack_val = clocs[i] if not isinstance(clocs[i], tuple) else clocs[i][0]
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            data = data.unstack(unstack_val, fill_value=fill_value)
        return data

    # Proceed with non-hierarchical columns
    # Rest of the code remains same...
    # ... (existing implementation)

    return unstacked
```

Note that this is a partial fix to address the bug related to the MultiIndex unstacking. Further investigation might be needed to handle additional edge cases.
