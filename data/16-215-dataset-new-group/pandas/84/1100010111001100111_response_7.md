The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the segment where it attempts to handle hierarchical columns. The main issue seems to stem from the fact that the function does not handle combining a MultiIndex with a tuple in the `unstack` method.

The relevant portions of the function that need to be fixed are:
```
# NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
```

The reported test failures and the runtime input/output variable values reveal that the function is encountering errors while dealing with multi-indexes as well as tuple-based unstacking levels.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle tuple-based unstacking of MultiIndex. This can be accomplished by improving the logic for dealing with hierarchical columns and unstacking them correctly while maintaining the integrity of the data. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    index = data.index
    unstack_levels = [idx if isinstance(idx, tuple) else (idx,) for idx in clocs]
    
    unstacked = data.unstack(unstack_levels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This revised implementation should be capable of correctly handling the unstacking of MultiIndexes with tuple-based levels. After making these changes, the function should be able to pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
