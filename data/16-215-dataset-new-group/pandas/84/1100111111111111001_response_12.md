The cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` includes an exception related to level numbers. This is causing the ValueError and KeyError in the failing tests. The logic is also overly complex and difficult to follow. 

The function's logic can be simplified by using the `unstack` function directly within the `_unstack_multiple` function, eliminating the need for the complex logic within `_unstack_multiple`.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be rewritten. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version of the function, we remove the unnecessary and redundant logic, and utilize the built-in `unstack` method of the Series and DataFrame objects. The implementation is simplified and more straightforward. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected outputs.
