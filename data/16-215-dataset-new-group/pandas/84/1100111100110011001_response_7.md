The issue stems from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that it's trying to access the level 'A', but it's not found in the list of names.

The bug seems to occur when interpreting MultiIndex index and columns. The index is formed properly from rlevels and dummy columns properly from Clevel combinations of the old index which is probably not able to interpret the provided level 'A'. 

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to re-evaluate the logic of how the levels and placeholders are manipulated and how the combination of new columns are formed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(data.index.get_level_values(0).unique(), name=rnames[0])
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels,
            codes=rcodes,
            names=rnames,
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)

        return result
```

In the corrected function, we use `data.index.get_level_values(0).unique()` to create a dummy index, ensuring that the principle level is captured correctly. We also simplify the logic for building the unstacked DataFrame while removing unnecessary conditional checks.
