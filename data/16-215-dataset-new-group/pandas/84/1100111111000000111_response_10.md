The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function which is an internal function of the pandas library, specifically within the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file. The bug is associated with the unstacking process when dealing with MultiIndexed data and tuple names. The source of the error is traced to the `index._get_level_number(i)` method call. 

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of MultiIndexed data with tuple names within the `_unstack_multiple` function. Specifically, when attempting to retrieve the level number using the `index._get_level_number(i)` method, it fails when dealing with tuple names within the MultiIndex. It throws a KeyError claiming that "Level A not found".

The strategy for fixing the bug involves handling the tuple names properly when processing the MultiIndexed data. It may require a modification in how the levels and codes from the MultiIndex are accessed and processed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_product(clevels, names=cnames)
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_product([rlevels + clevels], names=rnames + cnames)
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(list(range(len(clocs))), fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(list(range(len(rlocs, index.nlevels))), fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The updated function makes use of the `get_level_values` method to access the values of levels from the MultiIndex. It then constructs a new MultiIndex using `MultiIndex.from_product`, employing the proper names and values for the new index. Finally, the unstacking operation is performed using the obtained dummy dataframe.

The corrected function should now successfully handle the unstacking of MultiIndexed data with tuple names, resolving the KeyError issue and passing the failing test case.
