The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` contains an error in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This error originates from the `_get_level_number` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module. The `_get_level_number` method looks for the input level in the `self.names` of the MultiIndex and returns the index number of the level. The error occurs when it doesn't find the specific level in the `self.names` and raises a KeyError or a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we can make modifications to the `_get_level_number` method. We need to ensure that the input level is being correctly processed and the correct error handling is in place when the level is not found. It may also require modifications in the data handling process within the `_unstack_multiple` method.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_level_number` method and the associated `_unstack_multiple` method:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    if isinstance(level, tuple) and len(level) == 2:
        level = (self._get_level_number(level[0]), level[1])
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not isinstance(level, int):
        raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    return level
```

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # add the modified _get_level_number method above
    def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
        if isinstance(level, tuple) and len(level) == 2:
            level = (self._get_level_number(level[0]), level[1])
        count = self.names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not isinstance(level, int):
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            level = self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
        return level

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the method implementation
    ...
    return unstacked
```

By modifying the `_get_level_number` method and incorporating its use within the `_unstack_multiple` method, we ensure that the input levels are correctly processed and errors are handled appropriately when the levels are not found.

This should address the bug and enable the correct handling of MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names, as described in the GitHub issue.
