The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it is handling the index object incorrectly and is failing to determine the level numbers with tuple names. This is causing KeyError and ValueError when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` to correctly handle cases with tuple names by modifying the logic to distinguish between integer and tuple names when getting the level number.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By correctly handling the cases with tuple names in the level numbers, this bug can be resolved, and the failing tests related to unstacking MultiIndex with tuple names should pass.

After making this change, you can verify the fix by running the failing test cases to ensure that the bug is resolved.
