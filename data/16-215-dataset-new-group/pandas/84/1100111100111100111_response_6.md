The issue stems from the fact that the `_get_level_number()` method in the `MultiIndex` class is unable to handle tuple names properly, leading to a KeyError during the unstacking operation, which is likely caused by failing to extract the proper level number when a tuple name is given.

Upon examining the relevant variables and their values at runtime, we can identify potential issues in the `_unstack_multiple()` function. The indexing and extraction of level numbers from `clocs` could be problematic, leading to incorrect values being used in subsequent operations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple()` function to correctly handle tuple names, ensuring that the level numbers are extracted properly so that the unstacking operation can be carried out without errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Check for tuple names in clocs
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        # Convert the tuple to a single string since unstack only supports single level names
        clocs = ["_".join(c) for c in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    # ...
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the fixed version, we first check if the `clocs` parameter contains a tuple, and if it does, we convert it to a single string representation using underscores. This ensures that the unstack operation is carried out without KeyError issues related to the level numbers.

Applying this update to the buggy function should resolve the unstacking issue with tuple names in the MultiIndex.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
