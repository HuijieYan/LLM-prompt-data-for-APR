The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing errors related to the functions `get_group_index`, `get_compressed_ids`, `decons_obs_group_ids`, and a custom `Index._get_level_number` method. Specifically, the error message indicates that 'A' is not found because the MultiIndex has a level with a tuple name.

The cause of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` function incorrectly assumes level names to be a single string whereas they can be a tuple. This causes issues when it tries to call the `_get_level_number` method with the entire level name as a tuple.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle the case when a level name in a MultiIndex is a tuple. We can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle this scenario by checking if a level name is a tuple, and if so, extract the first element of the tuple to use as the name.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i[0] if isinstance(i, tuple) else i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = get_compressed_ids(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In the revised version of the function, we handle the case where `clocs` may contain tuple names. We extract the first element of the tuple if it's present and pass it to the `_get_level_number` method. This change addresses the issue raised in the error messages.
