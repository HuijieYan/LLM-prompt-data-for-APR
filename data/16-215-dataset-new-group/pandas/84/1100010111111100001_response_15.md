The function `_unstack_multiple` is supposed to handle unstacking of hierarchical columns. However, the bug lies in the function when it tries to determine the level number for the specified column.

The bug occurs because the function expects column levels to be provided as strings, but they are actually tuples, causing the function to incorrectly infer the level number.

To fix the bug, an additional check is needed to handle the case when the column levels are tuples instead of strings.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_new = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc = tuple(index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc)
        else:
            cloc = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        clocs_new.append(cloc)

    clocs = clocs_new

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function implementation...
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function works correctly with both single-level and multi-level column indices.
