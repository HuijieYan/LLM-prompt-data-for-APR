The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to handling MultiIndexes, specifically when unstacking columns with tuple names. The bug is likely causing the function to incorrectly identify level numbers associated with the MultiIndex.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` followed by a `KeyError`, which suggests that there is a failure in handling MultiIndexes when unstacking the specified levels.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the function correctly handles the levels in the MultiIndex and properly identifies level numbers to perform unstacking successfully.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    obs_ids = data.index
    recons_codes = np.arange(len(data))

    dummy_index = obs_ids
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
``` 

This corrected version should address the issues with the unstacking operation on MultiIndexes and provide the expected output for the failing tests.
