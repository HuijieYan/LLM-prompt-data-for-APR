The issue seems to arise from the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas.core.reshape.reshape` module, specifically from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line of code is trying to map each element in `clocs` to an internal level number and store the mapped values in `clocs`. This works correctly. However, `clocs` is then used to obtain `rlocs`, the complement of `clocs`. The underlying issue is caused by the fact that `rlocs` should be calculated based on hierarchical columns, however, the function doesn't implement this feature at the moment.

To address the bug, I'd suggest modifying the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to account for the possibility of hierarchical columns. Specifically, the code needs to be able to handle the case where columns of the DataFrame are MultiIndexed. To implement this fix, we need to identify whether the columns are MultiIndexed and modify the unstacking procedure accordingly.

Below is the fixed version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # If columns are multi-indexed, iterate through the clocs and unstack each level
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    # If columns are not multi-indexed, continue with the existing logic
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the specific issue with unstacking multi-indexed columns should be resolved, as the function will handle multi-indexed columns appropriately when unstacking.
