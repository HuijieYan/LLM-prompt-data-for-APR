The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is occurring because of incorrect implementation for processing the `clocs` input.

The `_unstack_multiple` function is trying to retrieve level numbers for the given `clocs` by calling the `.index` method on the `names` attribute of the `index` object. This is causing the error. The `names` attribute of the `index` object is a list of tuples, and the `index` method cannot find a single string `'A'` or any tuple that matches the input `clocs`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `clocs` input processing in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It seems that the input `clocs` here represents the names of the levels. If that's the case, we should process them as such rather than trying to use them directly as level numbers.

Notice the line that says `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This tries to find the level number for each `clocs`, assuming `clocs` is a list of integer level numbers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # create a list of levels based on the names specified in clocs
    levels = [index.names.index(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in clocs]

    # rest of the function body remains the same
    # ...
```
