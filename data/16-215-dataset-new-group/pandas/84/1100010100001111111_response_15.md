The bug seems to be related to the way the function `_unstack_multiple` handles the indexing of levels when using multi-index data. The error generated suggests that the level "A" is not found, which indicates an issue with level number identification within the function.

To fix the bug, the identified error location is the part where the function retrieves the level number for each level in a multi-index. The issue lies here in the specific line:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The cause of the bug is that the code attempts to convert column names into level numbers, which doesn't work as expected when dealing with multi-index data.

To resolve this bug, we need to revise the way level numbers are identified and provide a solution for handling hierarchical columns properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):  # check if the index is a MultiIndex
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]  # map the names to level numbers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case of a multi-index separately by first checking if the index is a `MultiIndex`. If it is, then we map the names to level numbers, addressing the issue with hierarchical columns.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle multi-index data and perform the unstack operation as expected.
