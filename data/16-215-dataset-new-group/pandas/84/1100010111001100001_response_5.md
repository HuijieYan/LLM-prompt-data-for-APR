The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be due to incorrect logic in unstacking multi-level indices. This is evident from the failing test results and the runtime values of variables inside the function.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for unstacking multi-level indices to ensure that the correct column names and indices are created. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `clocs` contains more than one level.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to a list
    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    # Unstacking each level in clocs
    for level in clocs:
        data = data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)

    return data
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue with multi-level unstacking and correctly pass the failing tests.
