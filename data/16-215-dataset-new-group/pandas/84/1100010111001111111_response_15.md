To fix the bug, we need to address the issue of unstacking a MultiIndexed DataFrame with tuple names, which currently leads to a "KeyError." The issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function, where the code is failing to properly handle Hierarchical columns with tuple names while unstacking.

The fix involves addressing these key areas:
1. Properly handling hierarchical columns with tuple names when unstacking
2. Addressing how the code deals with the levels of multi-index labeling
3. Ensuring that error handling and exception are robust to prevent errors like "KeyError"

Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function to resolve the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in rlocs]

    if not rlocs:
        # Adjust handling for single level case
        dummy_index = pd.Index(data.index.levels[clocs[0]])
    else:
        # Properly construct the MultiIndex for the dummy index
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(rlevels, names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs])

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        # Handle unstacking for Series
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Handle unstacking for DataFrame
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

Key changes in the corrected function include:
- Properly handling the level numbers of tuples if present in the `clocs` parameter
- Refactoring how the `rlevels` and `clevels` are chosen and constructed to help in creating the appropriate `dummy_index` for the unstacked data
- Adjusting the unstacking logic for both Series and DataFrame to avoid KeyError

With these changes, the corrected function should resolve the KeyErrors and properly handle unstacking of MultiIndexed DataFrames with tuple names, as per the expected input/output values mentioned.

Now, running the failing test cases using the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function should result in the tests passing and satisfying the expected output values, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
