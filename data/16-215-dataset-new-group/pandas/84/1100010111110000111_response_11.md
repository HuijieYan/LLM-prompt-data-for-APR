The issue arises from the `_get_level_number` function in the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module, which raises a KeyError when trying to unstack a multi-index with tuple names. This bug has been reported in the GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError."

The cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` uses the `_get_level_number` method, which expects the level number but receives a level name such as `("A", "a")`. This leads to KeyError being raised in the `_get_level_number` method, causing the unstack operation to fail.

The resolution to this issue involves modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multiple levels referencing tuple names in the multi-index and passing those levels as part of the `clocs` argument.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    # Convert level names to level numbers for multi-level indices
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(lvl) if isinstance(lvl, str) else lvl for lvl in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Other implementation steps remain the same
    ...
```

In this correction, the `clocs` list is iterated over to convert level names to level numbers before passing the `clocs` to the `_get_level_number` method. If the level is a string, it's assumed to be a level name, and the `_get_level_number` method is used to convert it to a level number. This should resolve the unstack issue and ensure that unstack operations on multi-indices with tuple names are handled correctly.
