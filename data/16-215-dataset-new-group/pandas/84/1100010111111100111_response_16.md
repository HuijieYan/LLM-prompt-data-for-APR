The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely to be caused by the issue with obtaining the level number inside the `for` loop. The method `_get_level_number` runs into an error and is unable to get the level number, leading to a `KeyError` when using a tuple for unstacking.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve revisiting the logic to obtain the level number. It is important to ensure that the function can handle the scenario with multiple levels and tuple names for the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The remaining code remains the same
    # ...
```

With this change, the function should be able to handle getting the level number when a tuple is used. Additionally, the use of `isinstance(i, tuple)` ensures a conditional check to perform the specific logic for tuple names in the MultiIndex.

This corrected version should fix the bug, allowing the function to successfully execute unstacking operations on MultiIndexes with tuple names.
