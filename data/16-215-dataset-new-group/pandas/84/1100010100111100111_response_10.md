To fix the issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to address the error raised in the `_get_level_number` method. The error occurs when the function tries to index the level in the `clocs` list, which is causing a KeyError.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters, it appears that the `clocs` variable is supplied as a tuple, causing the downstream operations to fail when it's treated as a list of index references.

One approach to fix this bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle both single-level and multi-level indexing when `clocs` is provided as input. This way, regardless of whether `clocs` is a single level or a tuple of levels, the function can handle the indexing properly.

Here's an updated version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that can handle both single-level and multi-level indexing:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # If clocs is not a list, convert it to a list
    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

By converting `clocs` to a list if it's not already a list, we ensure that it can be iterated over without causing an error during index references.

This modification should resolve the issue and handle both single-level and multi-level indexing when calling `_unstack_multiple`. It will enable the function to properly unstack the multi-indexed data without causing KeyErrors or ValueErrors.

I suggest replacing the `_unstack_multiple` function with the provided corrected version to resolve the bug.
