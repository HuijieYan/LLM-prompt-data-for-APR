In the provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the error seems to be happening in the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" explains that the problem occurs with multi-indexed data when unstack is used along with tuple names. The error raised is "KeyError: 'Level A not found'", which indicates that the issue is related to the level being specified with string-based tuple names.

The code iterates over the clocs (column locations) and attempts to get the level numbers. However, this fails when the column names are specified using tuple names with strings such as `("A", "a")`.

To fix this, the function should be modified to handle the case when tuple names are provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Other code...

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            if isinstance(val, tuple):  # Check if the column location is a tuple
                val = tuple([index._get_level_number(sub_val) for sub_val in val])  # Convert tuple names to level numbers
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            if isinstance(val, tuple):  # If a tuple was converted, update clocs as well
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    # Other code...
```

In the corrected version, we first check whether the column location `val` is a tuple and then convert the tuple names to level numbers. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

With this correction, the code should be able to handle the unstack operation on multi-indexed data even with tuple names, and the reported KeyError should no longer occur.
