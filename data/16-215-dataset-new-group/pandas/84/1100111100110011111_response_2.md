The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from an incorrect usage or interpretation of the index names resulting in either a `ValueError` or a `KeyError` when calling `_get_level_number`, as evidenced by the failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the list `clocs` only contains integer values representing the level number, and not the level name. This can be achieved by directly using the level names to obtain the corresponding level numbers instead of providing level names which don't exist in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert level names to level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level_name) for level_name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function body as it is
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:
1. We ensure that the `clocs` list only contains valid level numbers by converting level names to level numbers using the `index._get_level_number` method.
2. The other parts of the function body, which involve the manipulation of `clocs` and `rlocs`, is kept as it is.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should no longer raise the `ValueError` or `KeyError` related to level names that do not exist in the index, ultimately resolving the issue identified in the failing test cases.
