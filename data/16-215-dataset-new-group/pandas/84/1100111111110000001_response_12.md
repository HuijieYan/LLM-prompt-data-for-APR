Looking at the error messages from the failing test cases, it seems like the issue resides in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. This method is used inside the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error messages indicate that the `Level A not found` error or `'A' is not in list` is raised during the process of extracting level numbers from a list of labels.

The cause of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` function is directly calling the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class, but it seems that it's not handling the tuple-multiindex correctly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function properly handles MultiIndexes. This might involve extracting the labels from the tuple-multiindex and then passing them to `_get_level_number` one by one or handling the multiindex differently within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):  # Handling tuple-multiindex
            cloc_number = []
            for clabel in cloc:  # Extracting labels from the tuple-multiindex
                cloc_number.append(index._get_level_number(clabel))
            cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle tuple-multiindex correctly and is expected to pass the failing test cases.
