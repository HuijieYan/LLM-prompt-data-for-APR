I will analyze the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` and its related test cases to identify potential errors and suggest strategies for fixing the bug.

#### Analysis:
The `_unstack_multiple` function is intended to handle hierarchical columns when unstacking in Pandas. However, the function has multiple issues, primarily related to incorrectly extracting and manipulating index information and unstacking operations.

Some potential error locations within the function are:
1. Incorrectly extracting level numbers for column indices (`clocs`).
2. Improper handling of MultiIndex when the input data has hierarchical columns.
3. Incorrect manipulation of the columns and indices for unstacking operations.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely causes the function to produce unexpected results and errors when dealing with hierarchical columns. As a result, the failing test cases are unable to validate the correct unstacking behavior.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle level numbers and MultiIndex for hierarchical columns.
2. Ensure correct manipulation of column and index information during unstacking.
3. Utilize built-in Pandas functions to handle hierarchical data structures.

#### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we directly use the `unstack` method on the input `data` with the specified `clocs` and `fill_value`. This utilizes the built-in Pandas functionality for handling hierarchical columns and should pass the failing test cases. Additional logic for handling specifics of MultiIndex and hierarchical column manipulation is not needed.
