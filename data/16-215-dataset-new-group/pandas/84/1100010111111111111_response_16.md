Based on the provided information, it seems that the `_get_level_number` function is causing the issue. The error message shows that an attempt is made to use a tuple defined as the `level` parameter, triggering a KeyError if the tuple is not found when trying to retrieve the level based on the input tuple values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to better handle the multiple indices and correctly retrieve the level based on tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    recons_codes = index.get_indexer_for(clocs)  # get the level numbers for the clocs

    unstacked = data.unstack(recons_codes, fill_value=fill_value)  # unstack using the level numbers
    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we use the `get_indexer_for` method to retrieve the level numbers based on the provided `clocs` tuple, thereby avoiding the KeyError issue. This change ensures that tuple names can be used to correctly unstack the multi-index.

This fix should resolve the problem outlined in the GitHub issue and make the `_unstack_multiple` function handle a tuple with hierarchical names properly.
