The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is encountering errors when trying to handle multi-level indexes during the `unstack` operation. The issue was reported on GitHub and describes a KeyError occurring due to the absence of the specified level within the multi-index. The root cause seems to be the incorrect handling of multi-level indexes within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-level indexes during the unstack operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if not isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = (clocs,)  # Ensure clocs is a tuple

    clocs_num = index._get_level_number(clocs)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(get_compressed_ids(index._values, clocs_num), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
            get_compressed_ids(index._values, rlocs),
            names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
        )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Adjust the new index and columns after unstacking
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = unstacked.index.set_names(cnames, level=clocs)
    else:
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.set_names(cnames, level=clocs)

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected function, the changes include:
1. Correctly handling the `clocs` parameter as a tuple to ensure compatibility with multi-level indexes.
2. Creating the `dummy_index` using `Index` for the placeholder case and `MultiIndex.from_arrays` for the general case, ensuring the integrity of the multi-level index.
3. Setting the names of the new index or columns after unstacking to match the original levels (for clarity and consistency).

This corrected function should resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues encountered during the unstack operation on multi-level indexes while addressing the GitHub issue raised.
