The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises because the indexing operation within the function is incorrectly handling tuple names for MultiIndex objects. This leads to the `ValueError` and `KeyError` exceptions when trying to unstack the input data.

The key variables causing this issue can be identified from the provided failing test cases. The bug occurs when the names and codes of the MultiIndex are being extracted and invoked. This issue is primarily connected to how the `clocs` parameter is processed when obtaining level numbers and subsequently generating new columns based on the unstacked data.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle MultiIndex objects with tuple names when performing unstack operations. The corrective action involves modifying the code that handles the `clocs` parameter to ensure the correct level numbers and codes are used for the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]
    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    if len(rloc_numbers) == 0:
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function handles the case of MultiIndex with tuple names when performing the unstack operation.
