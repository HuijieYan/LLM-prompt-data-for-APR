The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is causing unexpected results, as shown by the failing test cases. The analysis of the runtime and expected values reveals that the bug is occurring when attempting to construct the `new_columns` variable. The relationships between `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes` and other variables are complex and not functioning as expected.

The initial strategy for fixing the bug involves revisiting the logic used to construct `new_columns` and ensuring that it aligns with the expected values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... other unchanged code ...
    
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=[clevels[0]] + [Int64Index([i for i in range(len(obs_ids))])],
        codes=[comp_ids] + [obs_ids],
        names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the `new_columns` variable is constructed using a simpler logic that explicitly defines the levels and codes, ensuring that the columns are created as expected for both DataFrames and Series.
