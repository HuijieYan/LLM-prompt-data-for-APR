There is an issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function in the pandas library. The issue seems to be caused by the fact that it doesn't deal with hierarchical columns when performing unstacking with multiple levels. Specifically, it fails when attempting to unstack columns with tuple names.

In the provided GitHub issue, the error occurs when trying to unstack a Series using the `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` command, and it results in a KeyError with the message 'Level A not found'. This suggests that the `_unstack_multiple` function is not correctly handling the tuple names in the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the hierarchical columns when performing unstacking with multiple levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    if data.columns.nlevels > 1:
        # Construct the hierarchical index using a MultiIndex
        mi = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([data.columns.get_level_values(i) for i in range(len(data.columns.levels))])
        data.columns = mi

    # Proceed with the unstack operation
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the input data contains columns with multiple levels. If so, we construct a `MultiIndex` to represent the hierarchical columns before performing the unstack operation. This should resolve the issue related to unstacking with tuple names.
