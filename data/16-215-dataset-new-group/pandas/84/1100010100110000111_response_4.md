The buggy function `_unstack_multiple()` has an issue with the retrieval of the level number from the MultiIndex. It is causing `KeyError` when trying to get the level number.

The issue is due to the fact that the `names` property of the index is a tuple of tuples, and the `_get_level_number()` method expects the level's name to be just a string, not a tuple.

The best strategy to fix the bug would be to modify the `_get_level_number()` method to handle both cases: when `names` is a list of strings or a list of tuples, and then extract the level number accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(names, level):
        if all(isinstance(name, tuple) for name in names):
            return names.index(level)
        return index._get_level_number(level)

    clocs = [get_level_number(index.names, i) for i in clocs]

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged
    # ...
```

By using the `get_level_number()` function, we can now handle both cases where `names` is a list of strings or a list of tuples and get the level number accordingly.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
