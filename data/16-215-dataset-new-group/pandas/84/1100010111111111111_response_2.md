The bug occurs because the function `_unstack_multiple` doesn't handle Tuple names within the MultiIndex, leading to an incorrect index list, resulting in multiple runtime errors such as `KeyError` and `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to correctly handle hierarchical columns and Tuple names. This can be done by handling Tuple names within the MultiIndex using a different approach, either by writing custom logic for handling Tuple names or by utilizing existing Pandas functionality.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index
    index = data.index

    # If the column location is a tuple, retrieve the level using the names
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        # Otherwise, use the original approach
        clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code...
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if the `clocs` input is a tuple, and if so, retrieves the level numbers using the level names. If `clocs` is not a tuple, it follows the original approach.

By handling Tuple names in the MultiIndex separately, this corrected version should fix the bug and allow the function to handle hierarchical columns and Tuple names correctly. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to unstacking with Tuple names within the MultiIndex.
