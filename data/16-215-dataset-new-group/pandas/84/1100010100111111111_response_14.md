## Solution:

The function `_get_level_number` is raising a `KeyError` because it's expecting a level number but is receiving a tuple instead. This indicates that the issue lies in the `_get_level_number` method and the `_unstack_multiple` method within the `reshape.py` file.

The strategy is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` method to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple and to call the appropriate error handling for this scenario. We will add a check to determine whether `clocs` is a tuple, and if it is, handle it accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` method:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        raise ValueError("The tuple `clocs` should be a list")

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # ... rest of the original code
```

By adding this check and the appropriate error handling, we can resolve the bug and ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` method correctly handles the case where `clocs` is a tuple.

Feel free to integrate this correction into the `reshape.py` file to fix the bug.
