Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The cause of the bug is related to the way the function is handling the input `clocs` and its interaction with the `index` object. The function should correctly handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple containing MultiIndex level names.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the handling of `clocs` to ensure that it is correctly being processed and used to access the correct level names in the `index` object. Additionally, the function should handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple containing MultiIndex level names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function to address the identified bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc_level(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
  
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, the `clocs` list is being properly handled to address both the cases: when `clocs` is a single level number and when it is a tuple containing MultiIndex level names.

This approach should effectively fix the bug and ensure that the function can handle the unstack operation correctly, especially with tuple names in MultiIndex, as described in the GitHub issue.
