The bug is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function, where it's failing to handle the case where the column index is a MultiIndex. The function seems to be incorrectly assuming that the column index is a single-level index.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling MultiIndex column labels for unstacking. It tries to access the level numbers of the column labels, however, the function `_get_level_number` assumes that there will be no MultiIndex. This causes a failure when trying to get the level number.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the case where the column index is a MultiIndex. Instead of manually handling the level numbers and reinventing the unstack operation, the function should directly use the `unstack` method of DataFrame to achieve the required unstacking. It should also retain the integrity of the MultiIndex labels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By using the built-in `unstack` method of DataFrame or Series, we can eliminate the need for manual handling of MultiIndex columns, and directly unstack the given levels. This will ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly, and the test cases should pass without any errors.
