The function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels. The error occurs at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where it appears that the variable `i` is not taking values that can be found in `index.names`.

The error message indicates that the 'A' level is not found when executing `s.unstack(("A", "a"))`. The idea behind the unstack method is to convert a multi-index into a DataFrame by pivoting the grouped keys of the multi-index into separate columns.

The error message from the failing test in the GitHub issue indicates that the code is trying to access a level that doesn't exist in the index, and subsequently the KeyError and ValueError are raised.

This bug can be fixed by checking if `i` is present in `index.names` before attempting the access. A potential fix would be to ensure that the levels provided in `clocs` exist in the MultiIndex `index`.

Given these observations, the corrected version of the function would be as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In this corrected version, a check is added to ensure that only valid levels are used for the unstack operation, preventing the KeyError and ValueError that were previously raised.

This fix should resolve the issue and ensure that the unstack operation behaves as expected for MultiIndexed DataFrames with tuple names.
