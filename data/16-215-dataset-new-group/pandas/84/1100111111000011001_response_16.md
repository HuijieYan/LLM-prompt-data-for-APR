The issue in the _unstack_multiple function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the nested indices and the MultiIndex data type.

The bug is likely to be resolved by making the following updates:
1. Ensure that the function handles MultiIndex columns correctly by checking if the data.columns is a MultiIndex, and if so, iterate through the length of clocs, taking the value of clocs[i], and then unstack the result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):  # Check if columns is a MultiIndex
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            return result

        # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With these changes, the _unstack_multiple function should properly handle MultiIndex columns and resolve the issues encountered during the failing test.

The corrected function has been updated to handle the MultiIndex columns by checking their type and then appropriately unstacking the result.
