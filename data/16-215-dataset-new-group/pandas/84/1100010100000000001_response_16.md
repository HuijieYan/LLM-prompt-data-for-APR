The potential error locations in the given function are:
1. The creation of the `dummy_index` is not handled properly for certain cases.
2. There is an issue with the assignment of the new index in the `unstacked` variable.
3. The reassignment of the index or columns of `unstacked` is not being done correctly based on the type of `unstacked` (Series or DataFrame).

The cause of the bug is likely due to the mishandling of the index creation and reassignment for the `unstacked` variable, especially when dealing with MultiIndex and SingleIndex cases.

To fix the bug, the strategy would be:
1. Ensure proper creation and assignment of the `dummy_index` for all cases, including the handling of MultiIndex and SingleIndex.
2. Correctly reassign the index or columns of the `unstacked` variable based on its type (Series or DataFrame).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstacked.index = new_columns
        else:
            unstacked.columns = new_columns

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, I have ensured that the creation and assignment of the `dummy_index` are handled for both MultiIndex and SingleIndex cases. Additionally, the reassignment of the index or columns of the `unstacked` variable is done correctly based on its type (Series or DataFrame).
