## The buggy function

The `_unstack_multiple` function is failing, and it is designed to handle unstacking hierarchical columns to produce a DataFrame with a new shape. It involves various operations on the index and columns of the input data. The function has multiple conditional blocks based on the types of the input data and names of columns involved.

## Bug
The bug is occurring because when the function is trying to unstack the input `data` using the `unstack` method, it is not handling multi-index column names correctly. This is leading to an error when trying to get the level number from the index. The `_get_level_number` method is throwing a `ValueError` or `KeyError` because it is unable to find the levels due to incorrect handling of multi-index column names.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we could modify the logic used to create the new columns after unstacking and ensure that the correct column names are used when reassigning the columns to the unstacked data. We need to handle multi-index columns appropriately during the unstacking operation and update the new columns accordingly.

## The corrected function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs if len(clocs) > 1 else clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result
        else:
            dummy_index = index.droplevel(clocs)
            unstacked = data.set_index(dummy_index).unstack(level=clocs if len(clocs) > 1 else clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this modification, the input data is unstacked as required, and the output DataFrame will have the correct shape and multi-index columns.

Now, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle multi-index column names correctly and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
