Looking at the runtime input/output variable values, it appears that in all three cases the function initially receives two input parameters: `data` and `clocs`. 

The first case shows that the following code is run when there are no `rlocs`:
```python
if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
```

In the second case, the following code is run after the unstacking function moves data into "tall" format:
```python
unstacked.columns = new_columns
```

Finally, the third case demonstrates that the buggy function encounters 2 issues:
- An error occurs when the multiple index naming process yields a name of type `UnitTuple` which is not supported. The cause is traced to the `MultiIndex` instantiation method.
- The 'unstacked' DataFrame has the columns organized in a format that doesn't match the original 'data' multi-index setup:

```python
unstacked.columns, value: `MultiIndex([('d', 'a', 1),
            ('d', 'a', 2),
            ('d', 'b', 1),
            ('d', 'b', 2),
            ('e', 'a', 1),
            ('e', 'a', 2),
            ('e', 'b', 1),
            ('e', 'b', 2)],
           names=[None, ('A', 'a'), 'B'])`, type: `MultiIndex`
```

From the runtime values provided, we can see that a strategy for fixing the buggy function is to focus on the following areas:
1. Ensure proper organization of multi-index columns or rows after unstack operations.
2. Modify the logic that generates the MultiIndex names to avoid triggering errors due to unsupported data types.

Based on the error analysis, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    unstacked.columns = data.columns
    
    return unstacked
```
In the corrected version above, the code that sets up the `dummy_index` has been modified to ensure a regular index construction, and the final `unstacked` DataFrame has its columns set to the original `data.columns`.

By using the information derived from the runtime variables, the bugs have been identified, and the function has been corrected accordingly.
