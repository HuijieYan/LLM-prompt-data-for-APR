The cause of the bug is due to the `_get_level_number` method throwing an error when trying to locate a level within the MultiIndex object. This error occurs because the method tries to find the index of the level when it is actually an element of a tuple and not a valid level for the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method should be modified to handle tuple input by checking if the input is a tuple, and if so, treating it as a level itself. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_level_number` method and the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same

def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(
            f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
        )
    if not isinstance(level, int):
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            return level
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    else:
        try:
            level = self.names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

```

By modifying the `_get_level_number` method and handling tuple input within the `_unstack_multiple` function, the bug should be fixed and the failing tests should pass.
