Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function for the provided cases, we can see that the function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to handle unstacking of hierarchical columns. However, there are several issues leading to incorrect results.

Upon inspection, it is clear that the function is not handling hierarchical columns correctly. There are also issues with the reconstruction of new indexes and columns. Additionally, the logic for handling `MultiIndex` columns is not accurate.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling hierarchical columns and reconstructing new indexes and columns. Additionally, we need to make sure that the function supports multi-index columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            dummy = data.unstack(clocs)
        else:
            dummy = data.copy()
            dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack(rlocs if rlocs else "__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issues with handling hierarchical columns and reconstructing new indexes and columns. It also provides support for handling `MultiIndex` columns.

This should resolve the bugs and provide correct unstacking of the data.
