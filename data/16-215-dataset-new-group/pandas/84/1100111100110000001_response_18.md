There are two errors in the buggy function _unstack_multiple. The first error is related to the ValueError: 'A' is not in list. This occurs on line 320, when the function calls index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs. The second error is related to KeyError: 'Level A not found. This also happens on line 320, in the same location trying to retrieve the level number from the given level name.

The cause of the error is due to incorrect referencing of levels by name. The function _get_level_number expects the level number but is being given the level name. The KeyError further indicates that the level name 'A' is not found.

To fix the bug, we need to change the part of the code that extracts the level numbers from the level names. Instead of directly calling index._get_level_number(i) with i being the level name, we need to retrieve the level number for the given level name and then use that level number to perform further processing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    mentions = list(index.names)

    cnames = [i for i in clocs]
    rnames = [i for i in mentions if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in rnames]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rnames == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
