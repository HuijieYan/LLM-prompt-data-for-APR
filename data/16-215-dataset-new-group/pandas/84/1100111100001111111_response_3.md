The cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function stems from the way it handles multi-index and unstacking. When using a tuple to define the levels, the function is unable to handle the multi-index properly, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to unstack the data. This issue has been reported on GitHub, referencing the difficulty in handling multi-index unstacking.

To address this bug, I would suggest the following strategy for fixing it:
1. Revise the logic for handling multi-index levels, ensuring that the function properly interprets the levels when unstacking.
2. Verify that the function's approach to grouping and formatting the data aligns with the expected behavior for handling multi-index data.
3. Ensure that the function can properly identify and unstack the specific levels when using a tuple to define the levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    levels = index.levels

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    clevels = [levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By incorporating the suggested changes, the revised function now properly handles the multi-index levels when unstacking, addressing the reported bug on GitHub.
