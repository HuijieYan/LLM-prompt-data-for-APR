The issue with the unstacking behavior is likely due to the "_get_level_number" method within the function "_unstack_multiple" in the file "pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py".

In the first case:
- The function "clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]" is using a list comprehension to obtain the levels of the index. However, it is applied directly to the original input "clocs" without handling the tuple inside. This seems to be causing the issue with unstacking when the multi-index has named tuples.

In the second and third cases:
- The scenarios are similar to the first case, where the faulty code "clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]" is causing the unstacking to fail with KeyError, as shown in the errors.

To fix the bug, the function "_unstack_multiple" needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when "clocs" is a tuple of level names.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
  
    index = data.index
    
    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_number = tuple(index._get_level_number(name) if name in index.names else name for name in loc)
            level_numbers.append(level_number)
        else:
            level_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    clocs = level_numbers

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```
  
This updated version of the function should correctly handle the case when "clocs" is a tuple of level names. It iterates through the input and gets level numbers for each tuple. This should fix the unstacking behavior with named tuples in multi-indexes.

Overall, this change should resolve the unstacking bug related to multi-index named tuples, as reported in the GitHub issue.
