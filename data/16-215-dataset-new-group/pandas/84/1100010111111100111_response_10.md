The issue occurs in the function `_unstack_multiple` in the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. The relevant code part is:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The `KeyError` occurs when the method `_get_level_number` is called on the MultiIndex `index` object. The cause of the error is that the column levels are being passed to `_get_level_number`, which expects an index level, leading to the incorrect logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The strategy to fix the bug is to adjust the handling of the specified column levels based on whether it is a Series or DataFrame, and modify the logic to correctly process the levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        index = data.index
        dummy_index = Index(range(index.nlevels), name="__placeholder__")
        dummy = data.reindex(index=dummy_index, method='ffill')

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        unstacked.index = index.levels + (clocs[0],)
    else:
        index = data.index
        cols = [idx for idx, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in clocs]
        level_values = [index.get_level_values(lvl) for lvl in cols]
        unstacked = data.unstack(level_values)
        unstacked.columns = data.columns.levels[cols] + (clocs,)

    return unstacked
```

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` pass.

I have updated the logic based on the provided details of the failing tests as well as the cause of the error. This fix addresses the incorrect handling of column levels and ensures the correct unstacking behavior.
