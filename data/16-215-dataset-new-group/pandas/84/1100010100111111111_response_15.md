The issue is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function failing to handle hierarchical columns yet, which results in a KeyError. The error occurs due to the attempt to extract level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`, which causes a ValueError because the tuple names are not found. The issue was raised in GitHub and has been identified as a bug related to the unstack method when passing a tuple of names as the argument. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the method for extracting level numbers to handle multi-level indices or columns correctly using tuple names.

Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = index.get_level_values(clocs[0]).unique()
    rlevels = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
