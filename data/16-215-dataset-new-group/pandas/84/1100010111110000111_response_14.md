The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function as indicated in the failing tests and the GitHub issue is the `clocs` variable is not referring to the correct levels in the MultiIndex. This is evident from the error message `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and `KeyError: 'Level A not found'`

To fix this issue, the `clocs` variable should be indexed using the `Index` API to correctly identify the levels represented by the `clocs`. We can use the `Index.get_loc` method to find the positions of specific levels within the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]  # Updated here to use get_loc

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this update, the `_unstack_multiple` function should correctly handle the levels in the MultiIndex, and the failing tests and the GitHub issue should be resolved.
