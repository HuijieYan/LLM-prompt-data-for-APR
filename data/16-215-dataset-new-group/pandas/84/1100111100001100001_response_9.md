Looking at the input and output data, it seems like the _unstack_multiple function is meant to perform unstacking of data in a multi-index DataFrame. The problem is that when working with hierarchical indexes, the function is not handling the index manipulation and unstacking correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The main issue appears to be with how the function handles the hierarchical index. Specifically, it doesn't correctly handle the case when there are multiple levels in the column index, resulting in incorrect unstacking.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the logic for handling hierarchical indexes and unstacking within the function. It's important to ensure that the function correctly handles the multi-index structure and performs the unstacking operation accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Get the level numbers
    clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]

    # Perform unstack based on the specified levels and fill value
    unstacked = data.unstack(clevel_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we identify the level numbers of the specified column levels and then use the unstack function provided by Pandas to perform the unstacking based on the specified levels and fill value. This approach ensures that the unstacking is handled correctly, especially when dealing with multi-index DataFrames.
