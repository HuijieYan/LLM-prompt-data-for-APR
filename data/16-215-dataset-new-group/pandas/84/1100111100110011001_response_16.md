### Solution

The buggy function throws errors when it tries to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`. To fix this, we will modify the buggy function to use the proper level identifier for the `MultiIndex` in the input data.

```python
# Fixed function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    # Get appropriate level identifiers from names
    clocs = [i[1] if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code will remain the same
    # ...
```

This fix takes into account the possibility of the input MultiIndex having multiple levels, and it uses the second element of a tuple if the element is a tuple to identify the proper level. With this fix, the buggy function should work correctly for both single-level and multi-level MultiIndex inputs.
