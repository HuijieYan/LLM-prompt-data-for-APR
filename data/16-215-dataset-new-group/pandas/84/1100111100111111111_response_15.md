## Issue Analysis
The error occurs due to the use of a tuple of levels as input to the `unstack` function, but the `_get_level_number` method in the `MultiIndex` class does not handle tuple inputs correctly. The method assumes that the input is a single level name or an integer index and raises a `ValueError` or `KeyError` when the input is a tuple.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function's handling of the `clocs` variable, particularly in the statement `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This is where the tuple input causes the issue. The error is also related to the use of `clocs` to denote the column level locations in the input data.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the assumption that `clocs` is a list of single-level names or integer indices, while in the failing test, it is a tuple of level names.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by checking the type of `clocs`. If it is a tuple, the function should treat it as such and handle the levels within the tuple appropriately. If `clocs` is a list, the function should continue processing as normal.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # check if clocs is a tuple and handle it appropriately
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        levels_numbers = [data.columns.names.index(name) for name in clocs]
    else:
        # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
        index = data.index
        levels_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function's logic remains the same
    # ...
```

The conditional check at the beginning of the `_unstack_multiple` function handles the case wherein `clocs` is a tuple. This allows for appropriate handling of the levels within the tuple. This fix ensures that the input is correctly processed and prevents the original bug from occurring.
