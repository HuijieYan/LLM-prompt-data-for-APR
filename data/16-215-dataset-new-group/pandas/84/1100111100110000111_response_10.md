To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the correct level is being identified for the column MultiIndex. The current bug occurs when the `_unstack_multiple` function calls the `_get_level_number` for the column MultiIndex and does not properly handle the tuple names.

The issue comes from line 320 of the `_unstack_multiple` function within the pandas core file reshape.py. When the level to unstack is given as a tuple, the `_get_level_number` function encounters the issue of not properly finding the level 'A' because it's represented as "('A', 'a')".

The current implementation does not account for handling MultiIndexes with tuples names correctly, leading to errors when trying to unstack MultiIndexed data with tuple names. The error message "KeyError: 'Level A not found'".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` method to account for tuples while identifying the correct level and proceed accordingly. We should verify if a level with the complete label or tuple exists and proceed accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Corrected implementation of the buggy function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(multi_index, level):
        if isinstance(level, tuple) and multi_index.nlevels > 1:
            names = multi_index.names
            if level in names:
                return names.index(level)
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not present in the MultiIndex names")
        else:
            return multi_index._get_level_number(level)

    clocs = [get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function as before...
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case where the level is given as a tuple. We appropriately identify the level in the MultiIndex based on the provided label or tuple.

This corrected implementation should resolve the KeyError issues when unstacking MultiIndexed data with tuple names and pass the failing test as described in the issue.
