## The bug in the function

The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is that when it processes MultiIndex columns, the `.names` attribute of the index is a list of tuples. However, the code expected it to be a list of strings, causing a `ValueError` to be raised when trying to access the level number. Additionally, when accessing the level number, the code uses the index of the level name rather than the level itself, resulting in the error.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle MultiIndex columns correctly. We can achieve this by checking whether the columns are of type MultiIndex, and if so, extract the level names and process them accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [data.columns.names.index(loc) for loc in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index.names.index(loc) for loc in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the extraction of level names, whether `data.columns` is a MultiIndex or a regular Index.

This updated code should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.

This correction should fix the issues related to the incorrect extraction of level numbers and names from the index and allow the rest of the function to execute as expected.
