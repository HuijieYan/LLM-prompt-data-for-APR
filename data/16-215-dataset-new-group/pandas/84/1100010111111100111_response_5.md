The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it fails when working with MultiIndexed data, leading to errors such as `ValueError` and `KeyError`. The errors occur due to incorrect indexing and naming of levels in MultiIndex objects, especially when handling tuple names. 

To address the bug, the `if` condition that checks if `data` is a Series should be removed, and the `else` block that handles DataFrames should be modified to properly unstack the data. Additionally, some of the variable assignments and calculations could be simplified to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = index.droplevel(clocs)            # Drop the specified levels from the index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    new_columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels([None] + cnames)
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

This corrected version should resolve the issues posted in the GitHub bug and the failing test cases.
