The issue appears to stem from the `_get_level_number` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file. The `clocs` variable in the `_unstack_multiple` function is not being passed correctly to the `_get_level_number` function, resulting in a `ValueError` and subsequently a `KeyError`. This is causing the failing tests for the `unstack` method.

It appears that the index levels are not correctly mapped, resulting in incorrect location calculations and leading to the errors.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the levels from the input tuple are correctly identified, and the level numbers are properly obtained to avoid the `KeyError`. Additionally, the unstacked result should be structured to match the expected output of the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if index.names[i] not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        unstacked.index.name = index.names[-1]
    else:
        stacked_idx = index.droplevel(clocs)
        levels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + [stacked_idx.levels[-1]]
        codes = [stacked_idx.codes[0] for _ in range(len(rlocs))] + [stacked_idx.codes[-1]]

        new_index = MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes, names=index.names[rlocs] + [None])
        unstacked.index = new_index

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should resolve the issue and correctly unstack the dataframe according to the levels provided.
