The bug occurs due to the mismatch between specifying level names as string values, and the function expecting these level names to be interpreted as tuples. The error message suggests that the function is trying to find the provided level name (e.g., 'A') as a tuple, which is not the case.

To resolve the issue, the bypass to the block of the code that deals with the tuples (i.e., hierarchical columns) should be added to the initial `if` statement that checks whether the input `clocs` list is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        if not isinstance(data, Series):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            return result
        else:
            index = data.index
            clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
            rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
            # ... the rest of the function remains the same as in the original
            # ... code provided
```
