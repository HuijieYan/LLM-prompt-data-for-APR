The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be causing issues when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names. The issue arises because the function does not handle hierarchical columns properly. It results in a KeyError when calling `s.unstack(("A", "a"))`.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle hierarchical columns correctly. The function should include logic to extract and unstack the relevant levels and names from the MultiIndex.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    if len(clocs) == index.nlevels:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs[-1])
        
    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we first handle the case where `clocs` contains all levels of the MultiIndex. If that's the case, we unstack the entire MultiIndex using all the levels. Otherwise, we unstack based on the last level in the list `clocs`.

This updated logic should resolve the KeyError that was occurring previously.

Once you update the `_unstack_multiple` function with the corrected logic, re-run the failing test cases and verify that they pass successfully. This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
