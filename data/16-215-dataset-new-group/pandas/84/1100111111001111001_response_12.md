The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple`. It appears to be an implementation of the `unstack` function for multi-level indices. In the failing test cases, the `unstack` function is not correctly unstacking the data in the expected format.

The function has several sections for handling different scenarios and data types, such as dealing with hierarchical columns or regular columns. However, the conditional statements and variable reassignments may be causing unexpected behavior, resulting in the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, you'll need to revise the conditional statements and variable reassignments to ensure that the unstacking process is done correctly for multi-level indices and hierarchical columns. One approach could be to simplify the conditional logic and separate the code into clear sections for processing different types of data.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Unstack only if working with MultiIndex
    if not isinstance(data.index, MultiIndex):
        raise ValueError("This function only supports MultiIndex data.")

    # Unstack according to clocs and fill_value
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, conditional checks are simplified, and the unstacking is performed directly using the `unstack` method of `DataFrame` objects. This approach ensures that the unstacking process is correctly applied to MultiIndex data, and it should resolve the issues with the failing test cases.
