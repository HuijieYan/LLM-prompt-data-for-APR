The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the hierarchical column indices. It fails to accurately determine the location of the hierarchical levels and mistakenly separates them into different cases, leading to incorrect unstacking and indexing.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the hierarchical column indices and their unstacking process. Specifically, we need to ensure that the unstacking is performed correctly, and the new levels, names, and codes are constructed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[i].to_list() for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i].to_list() for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(rlevels) == 0:
        rlevels.append(list(range(len(index))))

    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    data_copy = data.copy()

    unstacked = data_copy.unstack(level=clocs)

    clevels_to_fill = list(range(len(clevels)))
    if len(rlevels) == 1:
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
    else:
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels + [clevels_to_fill]
        new_names = rnames + cnames + ["__placeholder__"]

    unstacked.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(new_levels, names=new_names)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we properly handle the hierarchically indexed columns and perform unstacking accurately based on the input criteria. Additionally, new levels, names, and codes are constructed accurately for the unstacked DataFrame.
