The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the transformation of the input data. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with finding the level number of the input in the index. 

The function appears to handle different kinds of input data (DataFrame, MultiIndex, etc.) and performs an unstacking operation. It uses several conditional blocks to handle different cases.

The bug potentially occurs in the following lines:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line attempts to get the level number for each item in `clocs`.

The cause of the bug is that the input for `clocs` is a tuple, and when the function tries to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`, it's using the entire tuple instead of its elements. Thus, it can't find the tuple 'A' in the list of indices.

To fix this bug, we need to loop through each item in the tuple `clocs` and get the level number for each element separately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]  # This line is the potential cause of the bug
    # Fixed version:
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the fixed version, I have added a check to see if the item in `clocs` is a tuple. If it is, I use it as is; if it's not, I convert it to a tuple and use that to get the level number. This change should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly for different types of `clocs` inputs.
