Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    # Rest of the function remains the same as before
```

This change focuses on the portions of the function that deal with the `clocs` variable. The identified issue was due to incorrect indexing which ultimately caused the failing tests. By removing the specific line, we ensure that the problematic index operation does not occur. After this correction, the tests are expected to pass successfully.
