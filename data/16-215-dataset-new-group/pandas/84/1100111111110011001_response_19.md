## The buggy function analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` intends to unstack the input data. The error in the function seems to be due to the incorrect handling of MultiIndex. The function tries to unstack specific levels, but it fails to handle the hierarchical columns properly.

1. The function tries to retrieve the MultiIndex levels, codes, names, etc., to perform unstacking operations based on the index.
2. The function checks whether the data is of type Series or DataFrame and tries to handle the unstacking operations accordingly.
3. The function also creates new levels, codes, and names to be used for the transformed data.

The buggy function is intended to unstack the data based on given levels, but it is not handling MultiIndex columns correctly.

## Bug in the function
The bug in the function is related to the handling of MultiIndex columns. The MultiIndex columns are not being handled correctly, leading to errors when trying to unstack the data. This results in a failure to unstack the MultiIndex properly.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The fix should involve handling the MultiIndex columns properly. The function should identify and handle MultiIndex columns to perform the unstacking operation correctly. Additionally, any modifications to the index structure should also be handled carefully to avoid errors.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = pd.Index(index.levels[-1], name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex(
            levels=[index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + [index.levels[i] for i in clocs],
            codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [index.codes[i] for i in clocs],
            names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the hierarchy of the MultiIndex columns is properly handled. This should resolve the issues with unstacking and avoid the errors seen in the failing test cases.
