Looking at the buggy function, we can see that the primary issue lies in the handling of hierarchical columns. The function is not properly handling the MultiIndex columns, which results in incorrect unstacking and new column creation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of hierarchical columns and create new columns accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the necessary fixes:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have removed unnecessary code and simplified the unstacking process. We no longer need to create a dummy index or deal with different cases separately. The unstacking process is now straightforward and handles hierarchical columns properly.

With these changes, the function should now work correctly for unstacking with MultiIndex columns.
