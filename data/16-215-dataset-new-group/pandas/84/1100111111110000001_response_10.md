After analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The specific error is coming from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. It appears that the `index._get_level_number()` method is not able to handle multi-level indexes properly, leading to ValueError or KeyError when unstacking the DataFrame.

To fix this bug:
- We need to update the `_get_level_number` method to support multi-level indexes correctly and return the level for the "A" and "a" levels.
- We need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multi-level indexes properly and utilize the correct level information.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
        
    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
    
    return unstacked
```

This correction should address the issues related to unstacking multi-level indexes and provide the expected output for the failing tests.
