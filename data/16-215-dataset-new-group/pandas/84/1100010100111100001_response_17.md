The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is caused by the variable `clocs` being a tuple instead of a list. The function is designed with the assumption that `clocs` will be a list, so it fails when handling a tuple as input.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `clocs` is always a list, regardless of the input type. We can do this by converting `clocs` to a list at the beginning of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert clocs to a list

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```

By converting `clocs` to a list at the beginning of the function, we ensure that the function can handle both tuples and lists as input for `clocs`, which should fix the bug.
