The cause of the bug is that when a MultiIndex is created, the level names are stored in a list of tuples, but the `_get_level_number` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` class expects a list of strings representing the level names. This leads to a KeyError when unstacking using a tuple label in the MultiIndex.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to change the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle cases where the names of the MultiIndex levels are themselves tuples. To do this, we can loop over the clocs list, and if a cloc is a tuple, extract its string name or names and then get the level numbers correspondingly.

Below is a corrected version of the given buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_level_nums = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) 
                       else tuple(index._get_level_number(j) 
                                  for j in i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_level_nums]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_level_nums]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_level_nums]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_level_nums]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... rest of the function
```

This corrected version will handle both single-level and multi-level indices with both strings and tuples as the MultiIndex level names. This change should fix the KeyError issue caused by unstacking with a tuple label in a MultiIndex.
