To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to address the KeyError and ValueError that occur when trying to access level numbers and index names. 

The root cause of the bug is that the code is not handling MultiIndex with tuple names correctly, leading to errors when attempting to unstack the DataFrame.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the handling of MultiIndex with tuple names to correctly extract level numbers and index names.
2. Update the code to ensure it correctly handles MultiIndex unstacking when tuple names are present.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clevels)  # Unstack the data based on the specified clevels
    if fill_value is not None:
        unstacked = unstacked.fillna(value=fill_value)  # Fill NaN values with fill_value

    return unstacked
```

This version of the function modifies how clevels are assigned and uses them directly when unstacking the data. It also includes a check for `fill_value` and fills NaN values after unstacking.

By ensuring that the MultiIndex with tuple names is correctly handled during unstacking, this function should resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues encountered in the failing test cases.
