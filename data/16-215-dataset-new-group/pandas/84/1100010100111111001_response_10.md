The bug in the provided function is that the `clocs` parameter is being incorrectly computed, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values. This results in errors related to level indexing and mismatched indices.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the computation of the `clocs` parameter. 

I suggest the following fix:
1. Change the computation of `clocs` based on the input parameter.
2. Ensure that the levels, codes, and group indices are correctly aligned with the new `clocs` computation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This function doesn't currently deal with hierarchical columns

    index = data.index

    # Correct the computation of clocs
    clocs = list(clocs)
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # Ensure the rest of the function aligns with the corrected clocs computation
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    return unstacked
```

By correcting the computation of `clocs` and ensuring that the subsequent operations are aligned with the corrected computation, the function should now produce the expected results and pass the failing tests.
