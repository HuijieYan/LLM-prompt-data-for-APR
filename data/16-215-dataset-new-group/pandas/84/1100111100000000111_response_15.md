The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to handling hierarchical column indexes correctly. The bug triggers a KeyError related to not finding a certain level within the index, and the error message suggests that the issue is with the level not being found. This aligns with the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function, as this function manipulates the index based on levels.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the levels and corresponding codes are correctly processed to construct the new index before applying the unstack operation. Additionally, proper handling of different types of input data (Series or DataFrame) should be taken into account.

Given these considerations, here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clevel_numbers)):
                val = clevel_numbers[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clevel_numbers = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clevel_numbers]
            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            new_levels = [unstacked.index.levels[0]] + clevels
            new_names = [data.index.names[0]] + cnames
            new_codes = [unstacked.index.codes[0]]
            for rec in recons_codes:
                new_codes.append(rec.take(unstacked.index.codes[-1])
        else:
            new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[0]] + clevels
            new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames
            new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[0]]
            for rec in recons_codes:
                new_codes.append(rec.take(unstacked.columns.codes[-1])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the function initializes the `clevel_numbers` array based on the level numbers instead of the level names to avoid issues with level name processing. The process of constructing new index attributes and handling different types of input data is handled more consistently.
