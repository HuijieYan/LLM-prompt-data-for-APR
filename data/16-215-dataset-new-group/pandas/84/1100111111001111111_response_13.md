Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output variable values, the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by these lines of code:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The error occurs when `clocs` contains hierarchical columns, and the `_get_level_number` function is called with multiple levels. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code that handles the processing of the clocs to correctly deal with hierarchical columns. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Make sure clocs is a list of tuples

    # Ensure clocs are processed properly for hierarchical columns
    # Use this pattern to handle both single-level and multi-dimension unstacking
    if all(isinstance(cloc, str) for cloc in clocs):
        clocs = list(index.names).index(clocs)
    else:
        cloc_idxs = []
        for cloc in clocs:
            if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
                cloc_idxs.append(index.names.index(cloc))
            else:
                cloc_idxs.append(cloc)
        clocs = cloc_idxs

    # Rest of the code remains same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version focuses on handling `clocs` properly for both single-level and multi-dimension unstacking. It checks the type of `clocs` and processes it accordingly to ensure the correct behavior for hierarchical columns. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function behaves as expected.
