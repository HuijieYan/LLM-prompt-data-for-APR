The issue is with the function `_get_level_number` in the `reshape.py` file. The error happens when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names. The error message clearly states that the level 'A' is not found which leads to a KeyError.

The function `_get_level_number` is designed to find the level number based on the level name. If the level name is not found, it raises a KeyError indicating that the level is not found.

It seems like the root cause of the issue is that the function `_get_level_number` is unable to find the level based on the passed tuple names and raise a KeyError.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_level_number` needs to be modified to handle the tuple names properly when they are passed as part of the unstack operation. This likely involves modifying the logic for extracting the level number based on the tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged
```

In this correction, we differentiate the way level numbers are obtained based on whether the passed `clocs` belong to a MultiIndex or a simple Index. If it is a MultiIndex, they are directly handled using `_get_level_number`. If it is a simple Index, we extract the actual level names from the tuples and then work with them.

This change should resolve the error and ensure that the function can handle the unstack operation with tuple names in MultiIndex.

Investigating the condition before getting the level number in `clocs` and passing the correct context to `_get_level_number` will fix the issue and allow for the successful unstacking of MultiIndexed data.
