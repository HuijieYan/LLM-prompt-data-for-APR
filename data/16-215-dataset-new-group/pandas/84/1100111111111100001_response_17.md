The issue with the _unstack_multiple function stems from the clocs variable, which is supposed to contain the levels of the DataFrame index to be unstacked. Currently, the function is incorrectly handling the MultiIndex column names, which leads to incorrect unstacking. To fix this bug, we need to change how the clocs variable is processed.

Here's a corrected version of the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
      
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        result = data.unstack(level=clocs)
      
    else:
        result = data.unstack(level=list(clocs), fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

By using the unstack method directly on the DataFrame or Series objects, we can avoid manually manipulating the index and columns, leading to a more accurate unstacking process. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
