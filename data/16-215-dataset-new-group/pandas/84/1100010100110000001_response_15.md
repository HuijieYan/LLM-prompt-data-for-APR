Based on the error message, the key issue lies in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. It seems that the method expects a level number, but instead a name is passed causing the `KeyError` and `ValueError`.

To fix the bug:
- We need to ensure that `_get_level_number` gets the correct format of level number or name.
- The problem causing the error is likely the list comprehension in the `_unstack_multiple` function where `clocs` is a list of names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    levels = index._get_level_number(clocs)
    clocs = levels if isinstance(levels, list) else [levels]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we get the level numbers from the specified names and handle the result appropriately.

Now that we have corrected the bug, the function should behave as expected without raising any errors.
