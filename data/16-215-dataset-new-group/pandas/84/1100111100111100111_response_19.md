The issue with the _get_level_number method is leading to a KeyError because it is trying to find a level 'A' in the list of names, which are actually tuples. This causes the method to raise an exception, leading to the failure of the unstack operation.

The buggy function _unstack_multiple in pandas\core\reshape\reshape.py uses the _get_level_number function to obtain the level number based on the passed clocs argument. The _get_level_number function expects a simple string, but in the failing tests, it receives a tuple instead. This mismatch of input data types leads to the KeyError that is raised.

In order to fix this issue, the _unstack_multiple function needs to handle the case where a tuple is passed as the clocs argument and resolve the tuple to obtain the corresponding level numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In this corrected version, we check if the clocs argument is a tuple or a single level. If it's a tuple, we level numbers for all elements in the tuple, otherwise we obtain the level number directly. This modification ensures that the _unstack_multiple function can handle both types of input for the clocs argument and resolve the levels correctly, addressing the key error that was caused due to incorrect handling of the input types.
