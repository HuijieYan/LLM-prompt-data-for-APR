The issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the section where it tries to get the level number from the index. It seems to be failing to handle the case when multiple indices are involved in the unstack operation, as the code is treating `clocs` as a single-level index when it's actually a tuple of multiple levels. 

The code should be updated to properly handle MultiIndex objects. It needs to correctly identify the level numbers for each level within the index.

To fix this, we need to modify the code to handle the MultiIndex case properly. This will involve updating the logic to handle multiple levels within the index when extracting the level number.

Here's an improved version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) if isinstance(level, tuple) else \
                    index._get_level_number((level,)) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # ... rest of the function
```

In the updated `_unstack_multiple` function, we explicitly handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple of levels. We retrieve the level number for each tuple, and fall back to treating it as a single-level index if it's not. This should ensure that the function correctly handles the representation of column locations.

This modification will address the issue detailed in the GitHub report and should produce the expected outputs for the failing test cases.
