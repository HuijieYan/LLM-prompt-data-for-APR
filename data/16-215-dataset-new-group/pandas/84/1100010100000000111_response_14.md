Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Data inside the `if` statement is not assigned to the `unstacked` variable.
2. The `reshape.py` file doesn't seem to handle the case where column names are tuples.
3. The function doesn't provide a way to deal with MultiIndex with tuple names.
4. The `KeyError` is being raised when `index._get_level_number(i)` and `level` don't match.

Cause of the bug:
The existing `_unstack_multiple` doesn't handle MultiIndex with tuple names properly, which causes a `KeyError` when attempting to unstack data with multiple levels.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names.
2. Validate and correct the code to prevent `KeyError` when accessing the index levels.

Here's the corrected version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```
