The issue arises because the `_get_level_number` function is not able to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names properly. This function is called in the `_unstack_multiple` function, resulting in a KeyError when trying to find the level 'A'.

The issue is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function's inability to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names due to the use of the `_get_level_number` function. This results in the level 'A' not being found in the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names and avoid the KeyError issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Ensure that the name is unpacked if provided as a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = (index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs)
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the `clocs` is a tuple. If the `clocs` is a tuple, we unpack it and then pass it to the `_get_level_number` function. This ensures that the function can properly handle the MultiIndexes with tuple names.

Once this correction is made, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to properly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names and avoid the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
