Looking at the given code, the function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a dataframe based on the specified column levels. However, there are multiple issues in the code due to incorrect handling of indices, column names, and unstacking operations.

The main cause of the issue is that the indices, levels, and codes are not being properly managed when unstacking, resulting in incorrect behavior and inconsistent output. The code also does not handle hierarchical columns well.

To fix the bug, the code should properly handle multi-level indices, restructure the levels, codes, and column names, and ensure that the unstacking operation is correctly performed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by directly calling the `unstack` method on the input `data` dataframe or series. By using the `unstack` method, it automatically handles the indices, column levels, and codes, ensuring that the unstacking operation is performed correctly. Additionally, this approach simplifies the code and improves its readability.

In summary, the bug was caused by incorrect management of indices, levels, and codes, leading to inconsistent behavior and incorrect output. The bug was fixed by directly using the `unstack` method to handle the unstacking operation.
