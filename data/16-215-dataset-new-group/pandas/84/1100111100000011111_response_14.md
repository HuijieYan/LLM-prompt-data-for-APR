## The bug
The bug seems to be caused by the mishandling of hierarchical columns when unstacking a DataFrame. This causes a KeyError when the unstacking operation is performed on a MultiIndexed DataFrame.

The key error originates from the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically the section where the level number for the column index (`clocs`) is being obtained. The error occurs because the index object's `names` are not being interpreted correctly, leading to the 'Level not found' KeyError.

## Fix Strategy
The fix involves modifying how the level numbers for the column index are retrieved. Instead of relying solely on the `get_level_number` method, the code should be adapted to correctly obtain the relevant level numbers based on the names provided.

## What to do
Refactor the code to ensure that when retrieving the level numbers for the column index, it properly leverages the level names. This will help in correctly identifying the levels and avoid the 'Level not found' KeyError issue.

## Updated Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... [rest of the function remains unchanged]
```
In this updated version, the clocs list is processed to check if the elements are tuples. If they are, the `get_level_number` method is employed, else the index `names` are checked to find the level numbers. This enables the function to correctly handle the level naming when performing the unstacking operation.
