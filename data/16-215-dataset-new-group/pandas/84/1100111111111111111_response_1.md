The issue arises from invocations to the `_get_level_number` method of the `Index` class in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The purpose of the `_get_level_number` method is to retrieve the level number of a given name in the index. However, the current implementation doesn't handle the case of a MultiIndex object with tuple names.

The probable fix involves modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex situations with tuple names. Additionally, the function must correctly process the input and generate the expected output for the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
# Fixd version of the _unstack_multiple function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code (unchanged)...

    return unstacked
```
In this corrected version:
1. The `_get_level_number` method is called only if the value provided is not already an integer. This accounts for both single-level and multi-level indices.

After applying these changes, the function should perform correctly for the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
