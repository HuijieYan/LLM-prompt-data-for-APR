`_unstack_multiple` is having an error because it is unable to correctly identify the levels in multi-level indices.

The error in the code is occurring due to the way the level is being processed. The `_get_level_number` method is trying to check if the passed level exists in the `names` of the index. However, due to the use of the tuple names (`('A', 'a')`), it is failing to correctly identify the level name. 

To fix the issue, we can change the way the level is being processed in the `_unstack_multiple` function. A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to extract the level names from the tuple and then use them to fetch the level number.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index.get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(cloc_numbers)):
                val = cloc_numbers[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                cloc_numbers = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in cloc_numbers]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By using `index.get_level_number(name)` we can get the correct level number for processing. This should resolve the issue with tuple names in multi-level indices.
