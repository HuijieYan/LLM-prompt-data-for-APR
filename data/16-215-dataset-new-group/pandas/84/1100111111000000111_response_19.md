The issue seems to be related to unstacking MultiIndexed data with tuple names. The buggy `_unstack_multiple` function takes `data`, `clocs`, and `fill_value` as input arguments for unstacking. The `clocs` parameter appears to be crucial, because it is used to extract the positions of the index levels to be used in the unstacking process.

The error seems to arise from the call to `index._get_level_number(i)`, which attempts to extract the level number for each index level. This method throws a KeyError for named levels because the code expects an integer index level instead. The approach also fails with named levels when unstacking two or more levels.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle MultiIndexed data with named levels correctly. The problematic statement `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` should be replaced with a more robust and flexible solution.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (remaining part of the function)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This adjustment checks if the `i` in `clocs` is a named level and gets the level number accordingly. If the level is represented as a string or a tuple (i.e., named level), it acquires the level position using `_get_level_number`. This modified section provides a fix to the key error caused by looking for named levels in the `index._get_level_number(i)` call.

After applying this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should have the capability to handle MultiIndexed data with tuple names correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

If there are alternative representations of the chosen level, you can add further checks and adapt the code according to the specific needs and diverse MultiIndex hierarchies.
