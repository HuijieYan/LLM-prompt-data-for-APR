The main issue with the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be that it is not handling the hierarchical columns correctly. It attempts to get the level numbers of a given `clocs` and lists the levels, codes, and names of both clocs and rlocs. Then, it separates the index into 'clocs' and 'rlocs', if rlocs are empty it creates a new dummy index. After that, it unstacks the data based on whether the data is a Series or DataFrame and proceeds to create a new index and columns.

The issue appears to be around the creation of the new index and columns, and the reassignment of the masked index and columns from the unstacked data. There might be a discrepancy when the data is a DataFrame, and the current logic does not cover all the cases for MultiIndex columns.

The overall strategy for fixing the bug would be to review and adjust the logic for creating new index and columns based on the structure of the data and handle the scenarios where the columns are MultiIndex properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Handling hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data, DataFrame) and isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data.copy()
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if not rlocs:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By handling the hierarchical columns correctly and adjusting the creation of new index and columns based on the structure of the data, this corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
