## Bug analysis
The issue here is with the `_get_level_number` function, which should retrieve the level number for a given level. It appears that the MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with a KeyError, suggesting `_get_level_number` is not handling tuple names correctly. This in turn leads to the failing tests in the `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` functions.

Based on the input values and derived variable values at the function's return, the bug appears to stem from how the `clocs` (column locations) are handled. Specifically, when `clocs` are passed as a tuple, the `_get_level_number` function fails to handle them properly, causing the subsequent failure. 

## Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to be updated to correctly handle tuple names. We can modify the implementation of `_get_level_number` to properly handle tuple names and return the correct level number. The fix will also include proper handling of non-multiindex cases.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Correctly handle tuple names
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # ...other part of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by first recognizing if `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, correctly handles it as a single location. This fix should resolve the failing tests and the issue reported on GitHub.
