The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function centers around handling MultiIndex objects and unstacking based on the levels provided in the `clocs` parameter. It seems that the function is not appropriately handling the MultiIndex levels and corresponding data manipulation resulting in the `unstack` operation failing with a KeyError.

The issue seems to arise from the `_unstack_multiple` function's inability to correctly handle the MultiIndex names and levels for unstacking. Specifically, when dealing with higher levels of the MultiIndex, the function fails to appropriately reindex the data for the unstack operation.

To fix this bug, modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex objects properly and ensure that it correctly manipulates the index and columns during the unstacking operation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the MultiIndex
    index = data.index

    # Create lists of levels, codes, and names
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    
    # Perform unstack operation
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Modify the levels, codes, and names as needed based on the unstacked result
    
    # If unstacked result is a Series, update the index
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.index, names=cnames)
    # If unstacked result is a DataFrame, update the columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.columns, names=cnames)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function handles the unstacking operation for MultiIndex objects more precisely, ensuring that the index and columns are appropriately updated based on the unstacked result.
