## Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is supposed to unstack a DataFrame by multiple columns. However, it seems to have issues dealing with hierarchical columns.

## Identified Potential Error Locations
1. The `if rlocs == []` condition is not handling hierarchical columns correctly.
2. There are inconsistencies in how `data` is being treated based on its type.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the mishandling of hierarchical columns and inconsistencies in handling the `data` variable based on its type.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Properly handle the hierarchical columns case.
2. Ensure consistency in handling the `data` variable based on its type.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
        )
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        unstacked = result

    return unstacked
```
In this corrected version:
1. Handled the hierarchical columns case by correctly setting the index of the unstacked data.
2. Ensured consistency in handling the `data` variable based on its type.
