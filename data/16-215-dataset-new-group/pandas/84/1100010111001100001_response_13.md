The bug appears to be related to the unstacking process of hierarchical indices, as evidenced by the failure of the test cases.

The potential errors in the `_unstack_multiple` function include incorrect handling of hierarchical column indices, issues with index manipulations, and incorrect construction of new indices. These issues lead to the wrong reshaping of the DataFrame, causing the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure the proper handling of hierarchical column indices during the unstacking process and correct manipulation of the index and column structures to match the expected output.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        unstacked = data.reset_index(level=clocs).unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels([1, 0])
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By reseting the index and then unstacking or directly unstacking the data depending on the presence of rlocs, we aim to address the issues observed in the failing test cases.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases, allowing for appropriate reshaping of the DataFrame with hierarchical indices.
