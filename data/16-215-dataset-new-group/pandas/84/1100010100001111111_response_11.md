## Bug location and its cause

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing issues when the `data` parameter has a MultiIndex, especially when trying to unstack multiple levels using a tuple of names as the `clocs` parameter.

The function attempts to accept a tuple of names for column locations (`clocs`) to unstack the given DataFrame. However, during the execution, the bug causes the function to only handle MultiIndexes to deal with the `clocs` parameter. It fails when the input is a tuple of names and raises a KeyError, leading to the failure of the unstack operation.

The cause of the bug is due to the implementation of the `clocs` handling in the function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the case when the `clocs` parameter is a tuple of names for column locations, especially targeting MultiIndexes. This modification should allow the unstack operation to work as expected and resolve the KeyError issue.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns: if clocs is a tuple of names (for MultiIndex), adjust it to match the 
    # expected format with level numbers
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        assert isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex), "clocs should be a list of integers."
        dist_levels = [data.columns.names.index(name) for name in clocs]
        clocs = dist_levels

    # ... (rest of the function implementation remains unchanged)
``` 

With this correction, the function now properly handles the scenario when the `clocs` parameter is a tuple of names for column locations (`clocs`) to unstack. This ensures that the unstack operation works as expected, especially for MultiIndexes, and resolves the KeyError issue.
