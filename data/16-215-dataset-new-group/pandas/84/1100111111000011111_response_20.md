The bug lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function, where the function `get_group_index` is being used incorrectly. The `get_compressed_ids` doesn't return the expected results, so the wrong values are being used to reconstruct the multicodes.

The cause of the bug is that `group_index` is not being constructed correctly due to incorrect usage of the `get_group_index` function. This results in `comp_ids` and `obs_ids` being incorrect, which further leads to faulty reconstruction of new codes.

The bug can be fixed by correctly using the `get_group_index` and related functions to ensure that the `group_index`, `comp_ids`, and `obs_ids` are being constructed correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = get_compressed_ids(group_index)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids]
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [unstacked.index.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[-1]] + comp_ids

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

After applying the changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
