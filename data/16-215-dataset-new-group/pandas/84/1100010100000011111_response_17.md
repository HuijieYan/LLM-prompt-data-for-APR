The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by adding the index name to the clocs list, which results in the KeyError being raised when it tries to get the level number from the index.

To fix the bug, the `clocs` list should be created with level numbers instead of names, the rest of the function seems to be working correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [i for i, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the level numbers and proceed with unstacking the data without encountering a KeyError.
