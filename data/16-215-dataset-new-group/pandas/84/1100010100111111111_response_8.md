The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it attempts to use the `index._get_level_number()` method to get the level numbers for a tuple of levels, resulting in the error message `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`. 

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not designed to handle a tuple of levels correctly. Instead, it's expecting a single level and failing to handle the case of getting the level numbers for multiple levels at once.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be updated to properly handle the case where a tuple of levels is provided as input.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]
        
    clocs = level_numbers

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```

This correction adds the handling of a tuple of levels as input for `clocs`. If `clocs` is a tuple, the function retrieves the level numbers for each level in the tuple. If `clocs` is a single level, it behaves in the original way. This correctly handles the scenario where multiple levels are provided as input.

Applying this correction should fix the bug and allow the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle unstacking with multiple levels correctly. This will address the reported GitHub issue related to the unstack failure when using a tuple of levels.
