Looking at the code and the runtime values, it appears that the issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function's handling of multi-index data. Specifically, it seems to have trouble unstacking multiple index levels correctly and fails when the input is a DataFrame with multiple index levels.

The most critical piece of code is the unstacking logic within the nested `if..else` block, which is difficult to analyze and debug in its current form. The unstacking logic seems to be working incorrectly for multi-index data.

To address this issue and fix the bug, we can simplify the unstacking logic and ensure that it correctly handles multi-index data. We can also ensure that the new columns and levels are handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    col_index = data.index
    col_levels = [col_index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    col_codes = [col_index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    col_names = [col_index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    obs_ids = range(len(data))
    
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=[obs_ids] + col_levels,
        codes=[range(len(data))] + col_codes,
        names=["__placeholder__"] + col_names,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
    else:
        dummy = data.stack()

    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    unstacked.columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.columns, names=col_names)
    
    return unstacked
```

This corrected version simplifies the unstacking logic and ensures that multi-index data is handled properly. It also sets the column names correctly.
