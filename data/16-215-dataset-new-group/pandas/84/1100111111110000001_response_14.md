### Analysis
The `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file contains a function `_unstack_multiple` that is related to the `unstack` function inside the same file, but not the same class. The failing test cases are calling the `unstack` function to test and compares the output against an expected result. The error message in both failing test cases is pointing to the same issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically the line where it tries to retrieve the level number of each column location.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function's attempt to extract the level number for each column location from the index. This causes KeyError and ValueError when the hierarchy for MultiIndex is present, leading to a failure in retrieving the level number.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The fix should focus on handling the case when dealing with a MultiIndex, especially when the columns have hierarchical names.

### Updated Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cnames = set(clocs)

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [idx for idx, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in cnames]
        rlocs = [i for i in range(len(index.names)) if i not in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This fix introduces a conditional check to handle whether the index is a MultiIndex or not, and then adjusts the `clocs` and `rlocs` accordingly based on the index type. This should resolve the issue of KeyError and ValueError when trying to access level numbers on a MultiIndex.
