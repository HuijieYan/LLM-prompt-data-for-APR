The error in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the use of tuple names in the MultiIndex, which is causing the `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and `KeyError: 'Level A not found`. The `_get_level_number` function expects the level to be an integer, but it is receiving a tuple instead.

Instead of calling `_get_level_number`, a MultiIndex should be passed to the `unstack` function directly. This will unstack the dataframe with a multi-level index as desired.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, level, fill_value=None):
    return data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
```

Ensure that the `unstack` function is called with the correct parameters and the error-prone code from the `_unstack_multiple` function is removed. With this correction, the failing test cases should pass.
