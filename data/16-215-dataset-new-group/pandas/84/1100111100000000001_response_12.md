The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the manipulation of hierarchical column data and unstacking operations on the index and columns. The function attempts to unstack the data based on the provided column locations, but there are several issues in the implementation that need to be addressed.

Firstly, it is attempting to handle hierarchical columns, but this functionality is not fully implemented, which results in potential errors when dealing with multi-level indices. Additionally, there are multiple conditional blocks for handling different data types (Series and DataFrame) that might be causing confusion and inconsistency in the processing.

To address the bug, the code should be refactored to handle hierarchical columns correctly and ensure consistency in data processing irrespective of the data type (Series or DataFrame).

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # Process the data consistently whether it is a Series or DataFrame
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
    else:
        dummy = data.stack()

    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        new_levels = expand_levels([clevels[0]], unstacked.index.levels)
        new_names = [data.name] + cnames
    else:
        new_levels = expand_levels(unstacked.index.levels, clevels)
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the function now consistently processes the data type (Series or DataFrame), correctly handles the hierarchical columns, and ensures proper unstacking operations on the index and columns. Additionally, it uses the `expand_levels` function to manipulate the levels and names of the index and columns based on the unstacked result.
