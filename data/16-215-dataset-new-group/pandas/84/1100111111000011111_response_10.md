The cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the incorrect handling of hierarchical columns with multi-level names. This results in a KeyError related to unstacking the Series with multi-index levels. Thus, the issue seems to originate from line 317 of the `_unstack_multiple` function, where it attempts to find the level number.

To fix this bug, we should handle hierarchical columns in the `_unstack_multiple` function and ensure it correctly unstacks the Series with multi-index levels. The correction should handle both Series and DataFrames with MultiIndex columns, considering the different scenarios accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Perform unstacking based on index type: MultiIndex or single-index
    if isinstance(data.index, MultiIndex) and isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        for val in clocs:
            result = data.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    index = data.index
    unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs)  # Unstack the provided levels

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function handles the unstacking process differently based on the type of indices. We perform unstacking directly for single-index type columns and use the provided level to unstack multi-index columns. This correction aims to unify the handling of unstacking operations in both cases and ensures that the specified levels are correctly processed.

This corrected version should resolve the issue related to unstacking Series with multi-index levels and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should also pass the failing test cases provided.
