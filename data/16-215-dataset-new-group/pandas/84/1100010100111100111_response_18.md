The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` tries to unstack a multi-indexed DataFrame, but it fails due to an error related to level names and their corresponding level number. The function attempts to get the level number for each level name in the input, causing a `ValueError` and then a `KeyError`. The issue documented on GitHub describes a scenario where the `unstack` operation fails when a tuple is used as a level name.

The cause of the bug is that when using a tuple as a level name, the function does not handle it properly. The function tries to retrieve the level number for each name in the tuple, resulting in errors when a name is not found or occurs multiple times.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle tuples as level names without trying to get their level number from the index. Instead, it should directly use the tuple as a level name for unstacking.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]
    cnames = [name for name in clocs]

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy.index.droplevel(cnames)

    unstacked = dummy.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version avoids the need to handle tuples as level names and directly uses the tuple for unstacking the DataFrame. The modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub report and resolve the failing tests.
