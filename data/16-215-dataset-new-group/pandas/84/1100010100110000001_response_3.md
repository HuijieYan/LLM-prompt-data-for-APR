The error messages indicate that in both cases the 'A' is not found in the list. It seems that the level name is passed as a tuple and when the _get_level_number function is called in the list comprehension within the _unstack_multiple function, it checks for 'A' which is a tuple and not a single value.

The cause of the bug is in the level argument passed into the list comprehension in the _unstack_multiple function. The error message indicates that it's trying to access 'A', which might be caused by it being passed as a tuple.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the 'A' name is accessed correctly. In the case of a MultiIndex, a tuple is required to specify the level name to unstack. The correct level names need to be extracted from the tuple and then used to obtain the level number. Additionally, the function should accommodate the case where a level name is passed as a tuple and handle it properly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Access the correct level names from the tuple (if given)
    if all(isinstance(c, tuple) for c in clocs):
        clocs = [c[-1] if c[-1] in data.index.names else c for c in clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs] if not isinstance(clocs, tuple) else [index._get_level_number(clocs[-1])]

    # rest of the function unchanged
```

The corrected function checks if all elements in clocs are tuples, and if so, it extracts the last element from each tuple and compares it with the index.names to ensure the level name can be used to access the level number accurately. If it is not a tuple, then it is used directly to access the level number.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and the failing test.
