### Bug in the given function and the failing tests

The function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack the data based on the specified columns `clocs`. However, the function is designed to handle hierarchical columns whereas the failing tests involve MultiIndex with different names, causing the function to fail. 

The error arises because the function tries to retrieve the level index for a level name that doesn't exist, causing a `ValueError`. This is because the function isn't equipped to deal with the specific structure of the MultiIndex. The function uses the `_get_level_number` method to retrieve the level index for the given level name, and this method is unable to handle this particular case.

### Strategy to fix the bug

We can fix the bug by checking the type of the index and its columns at the beginning of the `_unstack_multiple` function. If they are instances of the `MultiIndex` class, we can handle them differently to accommodate this structure.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) and all(isinstance(c, tuple) for c in clocs):
        # This is a MultiIndex with tuple names, handle differently
        new_data = data.unstack(clocs)
        return new_data
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

        # Rest of the function as it is
```

This corrected version checks for the type of the index and will use a different approach if the index is a MultiIndex with tuple names. Otherwise, it will continue with the existing logic. This will allow the function to handle both hierarchical columns and MultiIndex with tuple names, addressing the issues encountered in the failing tests.
