The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `clocs` input parameter. It should be converted to a list of level numbers using the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. However, in the buggy code, the `clocs` tuple represents the level names, which leads to the error as the `_get_level_number` method expects level names to be specified as strings, not tuples.

To fix the bug, we need to convert the `List` of tuples to a list of strings before passing it to the `_get_level_number` method. The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs from a tuple to a list of level names
    cloc_names = [x if isinstance(x, str) else x[0] for x in clocs]

    # Convert level names to level numbers
    clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc_names]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By making this change, the `_get_level_number` method will receive a list of strings as input, eliminating the error caused by the mismatched data type.
