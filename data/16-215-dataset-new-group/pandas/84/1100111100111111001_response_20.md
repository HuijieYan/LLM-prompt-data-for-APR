### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function originates from the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line where it tries to find the level number for each level specified in `clocs`. This line raises an error, as the names provided in `clocs` are tuples, not just single level names, which causes the `_get_level_number` function to raise an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line to handle tuples correctly and retrieve the level numbers for each level name.

### The corrected version

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (previous code)

    # Extract the level names from the tuples in clocs and get their corresponding level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) if type(level) == str else index._get_level_number(level[0]) for level in clocs]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By first checking if the element in clocs is a string or a tuple, we can handle both cases correctly and retrieve the level numbers as needed. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected.
