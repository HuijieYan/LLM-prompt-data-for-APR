## Analysis
The buggy function fails when interacting with a MultiIndex with tuple names at specific indices. In both test cases, it raises a KeyError due to a ValueError raised from the `_get_level_number` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` function does not handle hierarchical columns in the `clocs` parameter and results in incorrect indexing, leading to level numbers not being found as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The fixed version of the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly handle hierarchical columns. It should identify the hierarchical columns' level numbers and use them where necessary to address the incorrect indexing.

## The Corrected Version

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Identifying level numbers for hierarchical columns
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same, as the fix addresses the underlying cause
}
```

The fixed version addresses the incorrect indexing when dealing with hierarchical columns by identifying the hierarchical columns' level numbers. It correctly handles these level numbers and should resolve the KeyError issue.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
