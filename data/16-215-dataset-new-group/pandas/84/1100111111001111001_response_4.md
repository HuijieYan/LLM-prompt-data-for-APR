## Bug in the code
The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing it to fail the test cases. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of hierarchical columns and the transformation process. Additionally, the code lacks proper restructuring of the data and columns during the unstacking process, especially for MultiIndex columns.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the hierarchical columns are handled correctly, and the transformation process maintains the integrity of the data and columns. It's important to carefully reconstruct the input DataFrame and its associated indices when performing the unstacking operation. Additionally, the logic for handling hierarchical columns should be reviewed and updated as needed.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Check if the input is a MultiIndex DataFrame
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        # Unstack each level in clocs
        for val in clocs:
            result = data.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            data = result

        return result

    else:
        # Regular DataFrame
        index = data.index

        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

        index_tuple = list(zip(*index))
        unstacked_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(index_tuple, names=clocs)

        unstacked_data = data.stack(clocs).unstack(clocs)
        unstacked_data.index = unstacked_index

        return unstacked_data
```

With this updated code, the `_unstack_multiple` function will correctly handle both single-level and multi-level indices for unstacking operations. It separates the handling based on the input type (Single or MultiIndex DataFrame) and performs unstacking accordingly. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test cases are passed.
