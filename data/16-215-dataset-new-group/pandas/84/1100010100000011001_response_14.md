The bug in the function seems to stem from incorrect manipulation of the input parameters and the data index and columns. More specifically, there are inconsistencies in the restructuring of the index and columns, leading to unexpected behavior and output.

The code seems to have issues in correctly handling the multiple levels of the index and columns, especially when performing unstacking operations.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the restructuring of the index and columns is done accurately and consistently throughout the function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the unstacked data (either a Series or DataFrame) is correctly mapped to the new index and columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs] + clevels
    new_names = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + cnames
    new_codes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we have made sure to consistently handle the restructuring of the index and columns and correctly map the unstacked data to the new index and columns. This should address the issues identified in the original buggy function.
