The bug can be identified in the `_unstack_multiple` function where it fails to correctly handle MultiIndex columns. The bug is located in the following lines:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The cause of the bug is that it doesn't properly deal with MultiIndex columns when applying the `_get_level_number()` function. This causes a ValueError or KeyError to be raised when trying to identify the level of the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the MultiIndex columns. Specifically, the section that deals with the identification of the level number of the MultiIndex needs to be modified.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_loc(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same as original
```

In the corrected version, we are checking if the index is a MultiIndex before applying the `_get_level_number` function. If it is a MultiIndex, we use `_get_level_number` for tuples and `_get_loc` for single level labels. Otherwise, we just apply `_get_level_number` directly.

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to correctly handle MultiIndex columns and pass the failing test cases.
