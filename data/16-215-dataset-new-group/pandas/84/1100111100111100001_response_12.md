The issue with the current implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it is not handling MultiIndex columns correctly, which is leading to the error when trying to get the level number of the columns.

The error message, "The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number", occurs because the code is trying to find the level number for a MultiIndex column label, and the logic is not handling this correctly.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the logic that processes MultiIndex columns, particularly in the portion of code that handles the creation of new columns and re-indexing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code can properly handle MultiIndex columns when performing the unstack operation. This will involve correctly identifying the levels and labels of the MultiIndex columns, and appropriately creating new MultiIndex columns after unstacking.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Check if data.columns is a MultiIndex
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            # Adjust the value for each level in clocs
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            # Adjust remaining clocs
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result

    # Rest of the code for handling single-level Index
    else:
        index = data.index
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        # ... (rest of the original code)
```

By adding a conditional check at the start of the function to handle MultiIndex columns separately, we can address the issue with the current implementation. This check allows the function to identify and handle MultiIndex columns correctly, and perform the unstack operation accordingly.
