### Fixing the Bug

#### Analysis
- The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is a part of pandas library and is used for unstacking multi-index data. 
- The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle hierarchical columns correctly when unstacking, which leads to a KeyError during the unstacking process.
- The failing test cases provided test the unstacking process on multi-index data with tuple names.

#### Potential Error Locations
- The error is likely to occur in the section of the function where it processes hierarchical columns.
- The line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` seems to be the potential source of the bug as it does not handle the tuple names in the multi-index correctly. 

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- We need to update the logic for handling hierarchical columns and tuple names in the multi-index data when unstacking.
- Proper error handling and checking for tuple names should be added to avoid the KeyError during the unstacking process.

#### Updated/Celected Fix
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs] # add check for tuple names
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

After adding the check for tuple names when getting the level number, the above updated version of the function should fix the bug and allow it to correctly handle multi-index data with tuple names.

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test cases.
