## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The `clocs` values are extracted from the index, and the `_get_level_number` method is used to obtain their level numbers. This may be the cause of the key error issue. 

2. The `unstack` method is called within the function if the object is an instance of `Series`. The result is then processed to generate the new index and columns. If the object is not a `Series`, there is a different process for calculating the new index and columns, which could introduce errors.

## Explaining the cause of the bug:

The error message indicates that an issue arises when trying to locate the level names within the index. The code contained within the `_get_level_number` method does this, yet it fails with a `KeyError` because it cannot find the specified level. This results in a failure during execution, as the key is not found based on the current implementation of the function.

The issue posted on GitHub further confirms this failure and the associated error message. It indicates that unstacking with tuple names fails with a `KeyError`. This confirms the presence of a bug in the unstacking methodology.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

1. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the method for locating and obtaining the level numbers in a different manner to avoid triggering the KeyError.

2. Additionally, the logic for handling scenarios where the object is not a `Series` would need to be assessed, ensuring that the process for calculating the new index and columns is implemented correctly in both cases.

## The corrected version:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data.copy()
            for i in range(len(cloc_numbers)):
                val = cloc_numbers[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                cloc_numbers = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in cloc_numbers]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version involves obtaining the indices of the level names instead of the level numbers to avoid the KeyError issue. It also ensures that the method works correctly for both `Series` and non-`Series` objects. Therefore, this version should fix the bug with the function.
