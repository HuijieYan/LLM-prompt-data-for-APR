There are multiple issues with the buggy function. The key problems include incorrect manipulation of level and multi-index objects, as well as incorrect manipulation of the data during the unstacking process. 

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle multi-indexes and incorrectly manipulates the index and columns when unstacking. This results in the incorrect reshaping of the data. 

To fix the bugs, we need to properly handle multi-index objects and ensure that the reshaping process is performed correctly for both Series and DataFrame inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = Index(ccodes[0], name="__placeholder__")
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product(clevels, names=cnames)
        unstacked.columns = new_columns
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            return result
        else:
            dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_product(clevels, names=cnames)
            dummy = data.copy()
            dummy.index = dummy_index
            unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

The corrected function ensures that multi-index objects are handled properly and reshaping is done correctly for both Series and DataFrame inputs. This should resolve the issues with incorrect reshaping of the data.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
