The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is occurring because the `clocs` parameter, representing the column locations, is being passed in as a tuple in the failing tests instead of a list of column locations. In the current implementation, the function expects `clocs` to be a list of column locations, but it fails to handle a tuple of column locations.

The error messages indicate that, upon attempting to retrieve the level number using `_get_level_number`, the function is instead trying to index the names directly, leading to a conflict in data types (trying to access an integer in a list using a string index).

To address this issue, the code needs to be updated to better handle the input data type and make the necessary conversions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... [rest of the code remains the same]
    
    return unstacked
```

The changes made include adding a check to convert the input `clocs` from a tuple to a list, when necessary. This will ensure that the function handles both tuples and lists of column locations correctly. This will address the issue reported in the failing tests and resolve the problem outlined in the GitHub issue.
