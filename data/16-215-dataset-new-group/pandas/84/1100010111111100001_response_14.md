## The bug
The bug is in the `_get_level_number` method and occurs because of a mistake in the clocs assignment in the `_unstack_multiple` function. When a multi-index is provided, the function should return multiple levels and column stacking. However, it fails to handle multiple levels and columns that are passed in the test functions.

## The fix
I will rewrite the `_unstack_multiple` function, taking care to properly handle multi-index inputs and unstacking according to the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # Get the levels and codes
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Construct a MultiIndex for unstacking if clocs is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        level_names = tuple(index.names[lev] for lev in clocs)
        new_index = data.index.unstack(level_names)
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value).reorder_levels(level_names).reindex(index=new_index)
    
    # If clocs is not a tuple, unstack the single level and return the result
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle both single and multi-level columns and produce the expected results for the failing tests.
