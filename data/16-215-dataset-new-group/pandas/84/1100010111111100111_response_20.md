The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing a `ValueError` and a `KeyError` when the `unstack` method is called. This error occurs when the `clocs` tuple has nested tuples (e.g. `('A', 'a')`) and one of the values in the nested tuple ('A') is passed to the `_get_level_number` method. The `_get_level_number` method attempts to find the index of 'A' in the internal list, but it fails because it's looking for a sequence directly in a union and it's unable to locate it. As a result, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it goes on to raise a `KeyError` which points to the missing 'A' level, due to the wrong index.

Based on the analysis, the fix involves modifying the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex with nested tuples as 'clocs' parameter. Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify the clocs nested tuples and flatten them
    clocs_all = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        clocs_all.extend(cloc) if isinstance(cloc, tuple) else clocs_all.append(cloc)

    # Rest of the function code remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we flatten the nested clocs tuples before processing them further. This modification ensures that the `_get_level_number` method can process the values from the nested tuples and address the indices correctly.
