The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely caused by incorrect handling of the input parameters and the resulting manipulation of the index and columns. The code is trying to unstack a DataFrame on specified levels, but due to issues in manipulating the levels, the function is not producing the expected output.

To fix the bug, the approach is to revise the process of handling the index and columns when unstacking the data and to correctly transform the data to achieve the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    else:
        result = data

    for loc in clocs:
        result = result.unstack(level=loc, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

Explanation of the fix:
- We have simplified the logic by using a loop to unstack the data based on the specified levels provided in `clocs`.
- The `unstack` operation is applied iteratively for each level in `clocs`.
- By using a loop, we are ensuring that each level is unstacked in the correct order, avoiding issues with indexes and columns manipulation.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
