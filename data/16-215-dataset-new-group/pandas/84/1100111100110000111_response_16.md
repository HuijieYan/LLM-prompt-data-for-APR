The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically on the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This function is associated with a GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The issue describes that the `ValueError` message gets raised when trying to unstack for MultiIndexed inputs with tuple names, due to a KeyError from a missing level.

The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of `_unstack_multiple` is unable to handle MultiIndexed objects with tuple names. This results in ValueError and KeyError exceptions being raised.

The strategy to fix the bug is to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndexed objects with tuple names properly. This involves ensuring that the `index._get_level_number(i)` call can handle tuple names and return the correct level number without raising any exceptions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            clevel = index.get_level_values(cloc).names
            clevel_number = [index._get_level_number(lvl) for lvl in clevel]
            clevel_numbers.extend(clevel_number)
        else:
            clevel_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function body remains the same
    # ...
```

This updated version should be able to handle MultiIndexed objects with tuple names properly and resolve the issues mentioned in the GitHub post.
