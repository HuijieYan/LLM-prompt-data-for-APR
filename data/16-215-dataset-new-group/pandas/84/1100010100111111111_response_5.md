The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_level_number` is not correctly using the level names from the multi-index. Instead, it is trying to access them as if they were integers. This leads to a `KeyError` since it is unable to find the level as an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_level_number` function to handle multi-index levels correctly by checking for the level names and then returning the index of the level name instead of trying to access it as an integer.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function, updated to handle multi-index levels correctly:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (rest of the function)

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the function)
```

By adding a check to see if the values in `clocs` are instances of a tuple, we can then use `_get_level_number` for the individual levels. This will prevent the function from trying to access the level as an integer, and resolve the `KeyError` issue.

With this solution, the function should now handle multi-index levels correctly and pass the failing test.
