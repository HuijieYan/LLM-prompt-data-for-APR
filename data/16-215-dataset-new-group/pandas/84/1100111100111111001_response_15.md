To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to address the issue with the `clocs` parameter. It appears that the `clocs` parameter is a tuple of multiple level names, but the buggy function expects a single level name in some parts of the code. We will modify the function to handle the tuple of level names correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Obtain the index from the data
    index = data.index
    
    # Convert clocs to a list of level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, tuple) else index._get_level_number((c,)) for c in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same...
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple by converting each element of the tuple to a level number using the `_get_level_number` method. This ensures that the `clocs` parameter is handled correctly inside the function.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the tuple of level names and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
