The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to reshape a DataFrame using a multi-index, but it contains a few logical errors. The function has a complex composition with many conditional branches, and performance may be affected because of repetitive operations.

The function seems to be designed for unstacking multi-level indexes with added error-handling for different data types, but the issue might be stemming from the repeated use of clocs. It is modified in the for loop, while at the same time it's used for iteration.

The cause of the bug may be due to the direct assignment of clocs list using the line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]` instead of making a copy of the list to avoid interference with the loop. This improper value modification of `clocs` affects further indexing operations and eventually leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should make a copy of the `clocs` list to avoid interference with the loop that uses the same variable. This can be done by replacing the problematic line with `clocs_copy = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            clocs_copy = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            for i in range(len(clocs_copy)):
                val = clocs_copy[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version of the function includes a new variable `clocs_copy` to prevent the interference of `clocs` list when used in the for-loop. This should ensure that the function properly handles the unstacking of multi-level indexes without introducing unintentional side effects.
