The issue seems to occur because the `clocs` input for the function `_unstack_multiple` is defined as a tuple with the form `('A', 'a')` or `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, when it should be an integer representing the position of the level in the MultiIndex.

In the first case, the function fails because it tries to find the index of `'A'` and `'a'` in the names of the MultiIndex. In the second case, the function also fails for the same reason, rather than receiving a list of integers.

The cause of the bug may be an incorrect assumption about the input format. The function is expecting level numbers, but it receives level names instead.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the input parameter `clocs` to pass a list of integers representing the levels of the MultiIndex. The level numbers can be obtained using the `get_level_number` function of the MultiIndex object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This change ensures that `clocs` contains level numbers, allowing the function to work properly when unstacking the data.

Once this correction is applied, run the failing test to ensure that the issue is resolved and that the function now properly handles the input.
