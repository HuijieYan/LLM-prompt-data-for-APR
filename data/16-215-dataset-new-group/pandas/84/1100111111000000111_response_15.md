The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function of the `pandas.core.reshape.reshape` module. The issue seems to be due to the failure to distinguish between single and multi-level columns in the multi-index. It has an impact on the `unstack` operation with tuple names. This issue is reported on GitHub as "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError".

The cause of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` method is unable to handle MultiIndexes properly. It generates an error when attempting the unstack operation through the "A" level of the multi-index.

Potential errors:
1. The issue seems to be with the `clocs` and `rlocs` lists.
2. The list generation and subsequent operations could be having issues.

A strategy to fix this bug could be to update the logic for handling multi-level indices. It should distinguish between single-level indices and multi-level indices.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
  
    # Rest of the function remains the same
}
```
With this change, the function should now handle both single and multi-level indices appropriately and avoid the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub.
