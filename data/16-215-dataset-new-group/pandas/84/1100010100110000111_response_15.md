In the buggy function provided, the issue arises from the `_get_level_number` method that's unable to find the specified level in the MultiIndex. This results in exceptions being thrown, such as KeyError and ValueError.

The cause of the bug is that the level specified to unstack the DataFrame or Series is not being properly handled. The `index._get_level_number(i)` code attempts to obtain the level number based on the level name. However, it's failing to find the level name, causing the KeyError and ValueError to be raised.

To fix the bug, a strategy to explicitly handle the levels specified in the unstack operation should be adopted. This could involve adapting the `_get_level_number` method to properly return the level number or revising the logic for dealing with the specified levels.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract level numbers from the MultiIndex
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    # Return the unstacked data
    return unstacked
```

The changes involve extracting the level numbers by checking if the elements of `clocs` are tuples (indicating multi-index names) and then obtaining their respective level numbers. This addresses the issue by ensuring the appropriate level numbers are used for the unstack operation, resolving the KeyError and ValueError exceptions.
