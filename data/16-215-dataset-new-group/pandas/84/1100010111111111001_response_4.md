The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing to unstack MultiIndex columns along a specific level due to errors in how it's handling the input parameters and constructing the new DataFrame. The function is trying to unpack the columns by iterating over the specified clocs, but it doesn't handle the MultiIndex column case correctly. The cause of the bug is the incorrect manipulation of MultiIndex columns, which results in incorrect multi-level unstacking and naming when constructing the new DataFrame.

To fix the bug, a strategy to address the issue includes ensuring that clocs are properly handled with respect to MultiIndex columns and correctly aligning and naming the columns when constructing the new DataFrame. This requires revising the logic that handles the unstacking process to accommodate multi-level column names and their extraction. Additionally, the code should correctly handle MultiIndex columns when constructing the new DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    cols = data.columns
    if isinstance(cols, MultiIndex):
        for i in clocs:
            level = cols.levels[i][0]  # Extract the level name from the MultiIndex
            data = data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        level = index.names[clocs[0]]
        data = data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)

    return data
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the unstacking of column levels from the input DataFrame. This should satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases provided.
