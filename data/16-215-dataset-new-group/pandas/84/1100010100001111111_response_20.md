The cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the manipulation of the `clocs` variable, which is a tuple representing the levels of the MultiIndex to unstack. The bug causes an incorrect index number to be stored in the `clocs` variable, leading to a misalignment in the subsequent processing of the data that results in the incorrect output.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves adjusting how the `clocs` variable is processed in order to correctly identify the level numbers. This will involve fixing the logic to correctly determine and manipulate the levels based on the input types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Adjust the clocs variable based on the type of input provided
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged from the original
    # ...
    # [Rest of the original code]
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle and process the input provided, surfacing correct level numbers for the subsequent operations.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and also provide a proper fix for the bugs identified.
