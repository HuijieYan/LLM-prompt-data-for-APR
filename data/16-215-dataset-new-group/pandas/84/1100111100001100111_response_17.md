The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be caused by an incorrect `clocs` variable assignment and manipulation. The function is designed to handle MultiIndexed unstacking, but it seems to not properly handle the "clocs" variable, which is used to identify levels to unstack on.

The `_unstack_multiple` function appears to handle the following cases:
1. If MultiIndex level `clocs` is empty, it returns the original `data`.
2. If `clocs` is not empty, it tries to reshape the `data` based on the given `clocs`.

From the GitHub issue description and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the provided `clocs` might be in tuple format `(level1, level2)`. However, the code mistakenly assumes `clocs` to be a list of level numbers and directly uses it for index slicing. This causes issues for tuple level names.

To fix the bug, the `clocs` variable manipulation needs to be revised to correctly determine the levels involved.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function with comments to help explain the modifications:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # If clocs tuple is empty, return the original data
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This function doesn't support hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Determine level numbers from the level names in the input tuple
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Calculate remaining level numbers
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
    # ...
    # ...
```

By correctly determining the level numbers based on the level names provided in the input tuples, the function will be able to handle MultiIndexed unstacking of DataFrames with tuple level names as shown in the provided GitHub issue.

Make sure to test this corrected version of the function with various multi-indexed DataFrames to ensure that it handles unstacking correctly and resolves the reported GitHub issue.
