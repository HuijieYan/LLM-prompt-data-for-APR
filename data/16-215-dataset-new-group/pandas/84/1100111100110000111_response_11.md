The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` function is attempting to find the index of a level in a MultiIndex by using the index method. The problem is that the level is a tuple and should not be used directly to find the index. This is throwing a `ValueError` and a subsequent `KeyError`.

To mitigate this bug, it is necessary to change the usage of the `_get_level_number` function. The correction should involve handling the provided level parameter as a tuple correctly and identifying the level number based on the name of the MultiIndex.  

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    index = data.index

    c_indices = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc = index.names.index(cloc)
        c_indices.append(cloc)

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in c_indices]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in c_indices]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in c_indices]
    r_indices = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in c_indices]
    
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in r_indices]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in r_indices]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in r_indices]
    
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)
    
    # Body of the function as before...
```

This corrected version includes a fix for handling tuple level names. The provided `clocs` are inspected, and if they are tuples, the level index is obtained by searching within the names of the MultiIndex. This eliminates the ValueError and subsequent KeyError.
