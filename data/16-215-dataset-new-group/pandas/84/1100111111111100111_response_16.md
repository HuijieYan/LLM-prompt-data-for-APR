The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be related to the handling of hierarchical columns, specifically in the construction of the `dummy_index` and the subsequent unstacking process for both a Series and a DataFrame. The bug originates from the `clocs` variable because when a tuple of names is passed to the `unstack` method, the `clocs` variable is used both for Series and DataFrame objects, leading to an incorrect index level. This is evident from the resulting error message, which indicates a KeyError due to 'A' not being found.

To resolve this issue, the handling of the `clocs` when a tuple of names is passed to the `unstack` method should be restructured, which will resolve the root cause of the KeyError exception. Furthermore, the management of the column levels (new_levels, new_names, new_codes) during unstacking should be reviewed. The comparison of the current function with other related methods should aid in the identification of the necessary adjustments to address this issue. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Add handling for hierarchical columns
    if len(clocs) > 1:
        # Handle when clocs is a tuple of names
        if isinstance(data.index, MultiIndex) and isinstance(clocs, tuple):
            new_index = data.index.unstack(clocs)
            if isinstance(data, Series):
                new_index.name = None  # Reset the name attribute for unstacked Series
                result = Series(new_index.values, index=new_index.index)
            else:
                result = new_index

            return result

    # Rest of the function stays the same for other cases
```

By implementing the adjustments as mentioned above, the corrected function should succeed in processing the inputs correctly. This revised version of the function should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
