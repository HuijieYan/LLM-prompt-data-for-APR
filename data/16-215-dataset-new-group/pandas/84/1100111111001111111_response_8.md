The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is resulting in a `ValueError` and `KeyError` when unstacking a DataFrame with certain multi-level index configurations. The three provided test cases all fail due to this bug.

The issue seems to be arising from the attempt to handle a multi-level index that includes tuple names. The inner `unstack` function is called based on different input configurations and the flow control within the `_unstack_multiple` function is complex, involving multiple if-else conditions.

The buggy function fails to correctly handle the unstacking of a DataFrame with multi-level indices that have tuple names. It mistakenly tries to reference levels within the index using invalid indices, resulting in `ValueError` and `KeyError` during the operation.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to simplify the control flow of the `_unstack_multiple` function and ensure that it handles the unstacking operations consistently across different multi-level index configurations.

Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    num_clocs = len(clocs)
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [index._get_level_number(col) for col in clocs]]

    dummy_index_tuples = index.to_flat_index()
    dummy_index_tuples_nlevels = [list(set(tup[n] for tup in dummy_index_tuples)) for n in range(num_clocs)]
    dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(dummy_index_tuples_nlevels, names=[index.names[r] for r in clocs])

    unstacked_data = data.unstack(clocs) if hasattr(data, 'unstack') else data

    result = unstacked_data.reorder_levels(dummy_index.names)

    return result
```

By using this revised implementation, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to correctly handle and perform unstacking operations on DataFrames with multi-level indices that include tuple names, thereby resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
