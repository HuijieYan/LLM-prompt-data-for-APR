Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the `index._get_level_number(i)` line. The function is expecting the `clocs` variables to contain levels of the MultiIndex, however, during the unstacking process, it is failing to find the levels in the index. This is why it's returning a KeyError or ValueError indicating that the level specified within `clocs` is not found.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `clocs` represent valid levels from the index, and if not, find a more appropriate way to determine these level numbers. We also need to handle hierarchical columns properly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # handling hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = Index(range(len(clevels[0])), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=clevels + [range(sum(len(l) for l in clevels))],
            codes=ccodes + [get_compressed_ids(ccodes, group_index)],
            names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = unstacked.index.codes[len(clevels) :]

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = unstacked.columns.levels
        new_names = data.columns.names + cnames
        new_codes = unstacked.columns.codes

    unstacked.columns = MultiIndex(
        new_levels, new_codes, new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we've removed the problematic `_get_level_number` call and modified the code to handle hierarchical columns properly. We create a `dummy_index` that should work for all scenarios, it represents a combination of levels for both MultiIndex and single index case. We also consider the case of a DataFrame with hierarchical columns, ensuring that the unstacked result maintains consistency in terms of levels and codes.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
