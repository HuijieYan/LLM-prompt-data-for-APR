The bug occurs in the _get_level_number function where the 'A' value of the level is expected to be present in self.names but it is not found, raising a KeyError. The bug was reported on the GitHub issue and is associated with the unstack_multiple function when the ModeIndex has tuple names.

The root cause of the bug stems from the implementation of the _unstack_multiple function, particularly the extraction of level numbers from the given location of columns. The function is failing to handle hierarchical columns. Additionally, the function fails to handle the MultiIndex with the tuple names appropriately.

To resolve the bug, it is suggested to modify the _unstack_multiple function to handle hierarchical columns effectively, ensuring that it can work with MultiIndex that has tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Added handling for hierarchical columns
    if not isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs if i not in index.names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By incorporating the modifications mentioned above, the corrected function should be able to fix the unstacking issue associated with the extracted level numbers from the given column locations. This should enable the function to work effectively with MultiIndex that has tuple names.
