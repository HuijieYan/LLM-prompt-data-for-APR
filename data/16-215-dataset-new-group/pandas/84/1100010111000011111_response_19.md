The bug appears to be in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the operation to retrieve the level numbers for the specified column locations, `clocs`. The code then proceeds to create a new MultiIndex, and depending on the data type of the input, i.e., a Series or a DataFrame, the approach to unstacking the data is defined. The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` for `MultiIndexed` unstack with tuple names indicates that the actual unstack operation is not producing the expected result.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the logic to retrieve the level numbers failing, which causes a KeyError. This results in further failures during the unstacking operation, and ultimately fails the test. The GitHub issue further details this, reflecting that the operation is unable to locate the specified level name within the index, leading to the error.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the correct level numbers are being retrieved for the specified clocs and that the subsequent operations for creating the new MultiIndex and unstacking the data work as expected.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) else index for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) else pd.factorize(index)[0] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) else None for i in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=clevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=[index.codes] + [comp_ids],
            names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels + [unstacked.index.levels[0]]
        new_names = cnames + [data.name]
        new_codes = list(unstacked.columns.codes)

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns

        new_levels = clevels + [unstcols.levels[0]]
        new_names = cnames + [data.columns.names[0]]
        new_codes = list(unstcols.codes)
        new_codes.insert(0, result.codes[0])

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version ensures that the index level information is properly handled based on whether it's a MultiIndex or not. It then proceeds with the unstacking operation, effectively creating and maintaining the new MultiIndex structure for the resulting DataFrame.
