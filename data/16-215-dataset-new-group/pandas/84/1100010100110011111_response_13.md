The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to have an issue when trying to unstack a multi-level index using the `unstack` method. The cause of the issue stems from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line attempts to extract the level number for the given level names in `clocs` variable. The error message indicates that it's failing to find the level name 'A' in the list of names at the specified level.

The expected behavior for this function is to successfully unstack the multi-level index and generate an unstacked representation of the input data.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_level_number` should be modified to correctly handle the tuple names in the `clocs` variable.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [l for l in clocs if l in index.names]
    rlocs = [l for l in index.names if l not in clevels]
    
    groups = [index.get_level_values(l) for l in clevels]
    unstacked = data
    for grp in groups:
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack(level=grp.name, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

In thie fixed version, the checking of `clocs` to validate the levels being present in the index, and then extract the level values that needs to be unstacked. The use of loop over these groups ensures that the unstacking is performed for each level. If the level exists, unstack operation is applied. If it does not exist, it will ignore.

These modifications should address the issue by ensuring that the unstacking process is performed with the correct level names and level values. This will allow the function to correctly handle cases where multiple levels are involved in the unstack operation.
