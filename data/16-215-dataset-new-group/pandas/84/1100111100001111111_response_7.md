To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to modify the logic that handles the unstacking of the DataFrame based on the provided `clocs`. Based on the runtime and expected values, it appears that the bug lies in the logic that manipulates the `data` DataFrame in the section that distinguishes `Series` and non-`Series` data.

It seems the issue is related to handling MultiIndexed unstack operations, and the KeyError occurs when the `'_get_level_number'` function is unable to find the desired level.

To resolve the bug, a potential strategy includes adjusting the indexing and unstacking operations on the `data` DataFrame and its index, ensuring that the appropriate columns, levels, and indices are used for unstacking.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    shape = [len(index.get_level_values(i).unique()) for i in clocs]

    # Performing unstack operation
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    # Check if the result is a Series
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked = unstacked.to_frame()

    # Renaming the columns for multi-level index
    levels = index.levels
    new_levels = [levels[i] if i in clocs else [""]
                  for i in range(len(levels))]
    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product(new_levels,
                                         names=[index.names[i]
                                           if i in clocs else None
                                           for i in range(len(levels))])

    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by evaluating unique levels based on `clocs`, then performing the unstack operation and correctly renaming the index levels and columns. This approach is expected to provide the correct output based on the provided test cases and the related GitHub issue.
