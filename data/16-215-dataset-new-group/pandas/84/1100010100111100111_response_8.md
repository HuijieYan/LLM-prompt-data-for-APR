The issue in the code is due to the `clocs` parameter being a tuple, which causes errors when attempting to retrieve the level number from the index. This then leads to a KeyError in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple by ensuring that it is transformed appropriately to be compatible with the index level number retrieval.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

The additional code checks if `clocs` is a tuple and converts it to a list of tuples if necessary. This ensures that the subsequent indexing operations work correctly.
