The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, which tries to extract and index names and convert them to level numbers. However, in Case 1, the `clocs` is passed as a tuple `('A', 'a')`, and the method `_get_level_number` expects integers. This issue is also reported in the GitHub issue, where the call `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` is passed a tuple that should be converted to level numbers, but it causes the error.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should perform checks on the type of the input variable `clocs`. If the input is a tuple, the function should convert the names to level numbers based on the DataFrame index. When the `clocs` input is a single level, it should be handled differently than when it is a tuple with multiple levels.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    elif not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the function can handle both single-level and multi-level input for the `clocs` parameter. This fix should resolve the issue and successfully handle the test cases.
