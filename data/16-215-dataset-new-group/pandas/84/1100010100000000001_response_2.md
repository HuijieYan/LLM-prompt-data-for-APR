The potential error locations within the given function are:
1. Use of the `get_group_index` function without checking for potential errors.
2. Incorrect indexing and assigning of new levels, names, and codes.

The cause of the bug in the provided function is the potential mishandling of the `get_group_index` function and the incorrect indexing and assignment of new levels, names, and codes.

To fix the bug, the `get_group_index` function should be checked for potential errors, and the indexing and assignment of new levels, names, and codes should be reviewed to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(clevels) > 1:  # Check if there are multiple levels
        raise ValueError("Unstacking of multi-level columns is currently not supported")

    # Use get_compressed_ids to compress the group index and get the compressed ids and observation ids
    groups = [get_compressed_ids(c, s) for c, s in zip(ccodes, clevels)]
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(groups, sort=False)

    rlevels.append(obs_ids)  # Add the compressed observation ids to the row levels
    rcodes.append(comp_ids)  # Add the compressed group index to the row codes
    rnames.append("__placeholder__")  # Assign name to the compressed observation ids

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels, codes=rcodes, names=rnames, verify_integrity=False)

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels, codes=rcodes, names=rnames, verify_integrity=False)

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the `get_compressed_ids` function is used to compress the group index and get the compressed ids and observation ids. Additionally, the handling of multiple levels is checked, and an appropriate error is raised if multi-level columns are encountered. Finally, the function returns the unstacked data.
