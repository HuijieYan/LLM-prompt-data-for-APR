The probable cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` is not accounting for the correct handling of the hierarchical columns yet. As a result, it fails when trying to unstack a `MultiIndex` with tuple names.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to refactor the code within the `_unstack_multiple` function to accurately handle the handling of hierarchical columns, ensuring that a `MultiIndex` with tuple names does not raise a `KeyError` and the unstack operation is conducted properly.

Considering the identified cause and the failure in the tests, the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple` is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code from the original function remains unchanged
    .
    .
    .
```

This corrected version of the function now includes a condition for checking the type of the input clocs, ensuring that if the cloc is a tuple, it fetches the level number accordingly. This modification would address the failure in unstacking a `MultiIndex` with tuple names and resolve the GitHub issue related to this bug.
