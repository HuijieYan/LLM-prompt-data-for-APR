The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it's clear that the variable `clocs` should not be passed to `_get_level_number` directly as it's a tuple of tuples. The error is caused by the function trying to find the index of the entire tuple `('A', 'a')` in the list of level names, which results in a KeyError or ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function `_unstack_multiple` so that it correctly handles the case when `clocs` is a tuple of tuples. It should unpack the inner tuple and call `_get_level_number` for each individual level name.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    # Check if clocs is a tuple of tuples, and unpack the inner tuple
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        # If clocs is not a tuple of tuples, just use it as is
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the input `clocs` when it's a tuple of tuples and find the level numbers for each individual level name. This should resolve the KeyError or ValueError that was occurring before.
