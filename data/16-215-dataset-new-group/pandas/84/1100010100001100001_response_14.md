The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to unstack a DataFrame based on a list of column specifications, but it contains multiple logical errors that result in incorrect data manipulation. The logic for handling regular DataFrames and MultiIndex DataFrames is flawed.

In the first case, the input has only one cloc, so it does not enter the part of the code that handles MultiIndex, but rather the regular DataFrame handling. In the second and the third case, it handles MultiIndex DataFrames. 

One approach to fixing the bug is to restructure the logic used to handle regular and MultiIndex DataFrames separately. Additionally, the variable names are misleading, and the code is not very readable even for an experienced developer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
        unstacked.index = unstacked.index.set_names(clocs)

    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for col in clocs:
                result = result.unstack(col, fill_value=fill_value)
            unstacked = result
        else:
            dummy_index = Index(index.levels[clocs[0]], name=index.names[clocs[0]])
            dummy = data.copy()
            dummy.index = dummy_index
            unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we check for the type of the input data and handle regular DataFrames and MultiIndex DataFrames differently. We also aim to improve the readability of the code and use more descriptive variable names for better understanding.
