In the given buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the bug is likely to be in the process of finding the level number of the column labels. This can be seen from the error messages and the relevant code in the function. The error message indicates that the value 'A' was not found in the list of level names. This suggests an issue with fetching the level number and may lead to the misalignment of the column labels.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the correct level number is fetched for the given column labels. Additionally, the process of unstacking the data based on the multiindex should be handled properly to align the columns correctly based on the specified levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Fetching the level numbers for the column labels
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we added a condition to check if the column label is already an integer, and if not, fetch the level number for that label. This ensures that the correct level number is obtained for both single and multi-level column labels, addressing the bug in the original function.
