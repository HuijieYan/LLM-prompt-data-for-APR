## Bug Analysis
The root cause of the bug is the failure to correctly handle multi-index information for unstacking in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The function appears to have issues when dealing with multi-level index values, which leads to incorrect results and key errors, in cases when actual unstacking is needed.

The defined index, the levels and codes, the group and compressed ids, and the resultant dataframe all have clear discrepancies. These issues are likely due to incorrect handling of multi-level index properties and the grouping and unstacking of the index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-level index values. The steps for grouping and unstacking indexed data need to be reviewed and adjusted to handle multi-index properties properly.

Additionally, testing with multi-level index input data is critical to ensure the correct behavior of the function with these types of inputs.

## Bugfix: Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Retrieve the index information
    index = data.index

    # Get the level numbers for the selected columns
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Define the column levels and codes
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # Define the remaining row levels and codes
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Perform the grouping of the column index
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Create the dummy index for unstacking
    if rlocs == []:
        # If everything is in clocs, the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
       # If there are remaining row levels, create a MultiIndex
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # Copy the data and set the new index
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    # Unstack the dummy dataframe, set new levels, names, and codes
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[-1]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[-1]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstacked.columns.codes[-1]))

    # Create the new column MultiIndex
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels,
        codes=new_codes,
        names=new_names,
        verify_integrity=False
    )

    # Update the unstacked DataFrame with the new columns
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected function includes specific modifications to correctly handle multi-index properties during the unstacking process. Additionally, it accounts for the adjusted behavior of the function when dealing with different input types and levels of multi-indexed data.

The corrected function should address the key errors and discrepancies that were observed in the bug cases. It's crucial to perform thorough testing with multi-level index input data to validate the behavior of the function.
