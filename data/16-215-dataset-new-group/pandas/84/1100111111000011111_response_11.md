Following the analysis and the failed test, it seems that the issue arises from the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`. The function's main problem is a missing handling for the case where `rlocs` is empty, and it is not dealing properly with hierarchical columns.

To correct this issue, you can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function by handling the case where `rlocs` is empty, and also properly handling hierarchical columns for both Series and other types of data. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = ccodes

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [unstacked.columns.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames
        new_codes = [unstacked.columns.codes[0]]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should resolve the failing test and the reported GitHub issue.
