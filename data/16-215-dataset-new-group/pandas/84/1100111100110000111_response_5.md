The error is happening in the `_get_level_number` method which is being called within the `_unstack_multiple` function. This is leading to a `ValueError` and then to a `KeyError`. The fail is happening due to the handling of the non-existent level or a level that doesn't have a number corresponding to it.

The `clocs` parameter of `_unstack_multiple` function is populated with the level numbers of the index but not the original level names. Then, it uses these level numbers to access level names. This is leading to a mismatch and causing the error.

To fix this bug, we must ensure that the `clocs` parameter is populated with the original level names, and then we can convert them into level numbers. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [i for i in index.names if i in clocs]
    if not clocs:
        raise ValueError("None of the clocs is found in the index")

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code follows...
```

By populating `clocs` with the original level names and then converting them into level numbers using `_get_level_number` method, we have fixed the bug.
