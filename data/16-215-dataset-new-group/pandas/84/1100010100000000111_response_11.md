This bug occurs when trying to apply `unstack` to a MultiIndexed DataFrame with tuple names. The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function of the reshape.py file.

The potential error locations within the `_unstack_multiple` function are:
1. The usage of `index._get_level_number(i)` on line 317.
2. The generation of a dummy index, `dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")` and MultiIndex, `dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids], codes=rcodes + [comp_ids], names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"], verify_integrity=False,` on lines 326-335.

The cause of the bug is that the `index._get_level_number(i)` function tries to retrieve the level number for non-integer input, which causes it to raise a `KeyError` for non-existent levels.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle tuple names correctly and ensure that the level names are preserved during unstack operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        cnames = [i for i in clocs]
        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

        dummy_index = index.droplevel(cnames)
    else:
        dummy_index = index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
``` 

In the corrected version, we correctly handle the case where the input data is a MultiIndex, and we exclude the names in clocs from the dummy index. Then, we use `unstack` function directly instead of manually creating a dummy MultiIndex. This ensures that tuple names are handled correctly and level names are preserved during unstack operations.
