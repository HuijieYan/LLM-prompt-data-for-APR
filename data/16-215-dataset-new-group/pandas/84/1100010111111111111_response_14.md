## Bug Explanation
The issue arises from the `_get_level_number` function in the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` class. This function is used in the `_unstack_multiple` function to get level numbers from level names.

When calling `df.unstack(("A", "a"))` as in the failing test, the `_unstack_multiple` function iterates over clocs, which in this case has value `("A", "a")`, and attempts to convert those into level numbers using `_get_level_number`. However, `_get_level_number` encounters errors when interpreting the tuple "A", "a" as the level name, triggering the ValueError and resulting in a KeyError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, I would revise the `_unstack_multiple` function to appropriately handle the scenario where the column locations refer to hierarchical (MultiIndex) columns. One possible approach would be to modify the logic for obtaining level numbers from level names to properly handle MultiIndex column names, ensuring that the index is correctly aligned with the levels and codes present in the MultiIndex column structure.

## Bug Fix

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Function to safely get level number from level name
    def get_level_number(idx, level):
        for i, name in enumerate(idx.names):
            if level == name:
                return i
        raise ValueError(f"Level {level} not found")

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]
        # Rest of the logic for MultiIndex handling...
        
    else:
        # Existing logic for non-MultiIndex handling...
        
    # Rest of the logic for non MultiIndex handling...
``` 

This revised function includes a dedicated `get_level_number` function to handle finding the level number from the level name when the index is a MultiIndex. It avoids directly using `_get_level_number`, which may not properly handle MultiIndex column names.
