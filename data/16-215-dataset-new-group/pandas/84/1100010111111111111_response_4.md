Based on the provided information, it looks like the issue stems from the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly the section where it handles MultiIndex cases. The test cases provided reveal that the function is experiencing issues in dealing with MultiIndex unstacking, which is leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to refactor the `_unstack_multiple` function and especially the section that handles MultiIndex transformation. The process should ensure that the index levels are correctly identified and extracted, and that the unstacking operation is performed accurately in accordance with the different levels of the index.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Modify the section that handles the hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

Please note that this is a simplified version of the function, and it is advised to thoroughly test the functionality with the existing test cases to ensure its accuracy. Additional changes might be needed based on results from the testing.
