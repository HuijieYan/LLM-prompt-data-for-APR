The issue is caused by an error in the `_unstack_multiple` function while handling hierarchical columns with MultiIndex. The function is intended to unstack a Series or DataFrame based on the provided clocs, but it's failing to handle hierarchical columns correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly dealing with hierarchical columns yet, and it's resulting in a KeyError when trying to unstack based on the tuple names. This issue is reflected in the GitHub issue where `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` fails with a KeyError, indicating that Level A is not found.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should correctly handle the hierarchical columns before attempting to perform the unstacking operation. Specifically, it should handle the column levels properly and ensure that the unstacking operation is performed without resulting in a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # handle hierarchical columns correctly
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result
    else:
        # Perform unstacking if the columns are not hierarchical
        # Rest of the code to handle non-hierarchical columns as before
    # ...
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by properly handling the unstacking operation for hierarchical columns. With this fix, the bug causing a KeyError should be resolved, and the function should correctly handle the unstacking of DataFrame columns.
