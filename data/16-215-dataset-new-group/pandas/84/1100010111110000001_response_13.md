The `index._get_level_number()` method is causing the error. The error is happening because the given level is a tuple, and the function is trying to find the tuple in the names of the MultiIndex. However, the get_level_number function only accepts a single name, not a tuple. 

To fix this, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multi-level column unstacking correctly. We can achieve this by checking if the given level is a tuple, and if so, we would then use the levels and names of the MultiIndex to identify the respective levels for unstacking.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if not any(isinstance(i, str) for i in clocs):
        # This case corresponds to multi-level unstacking
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]
        unstacked = data.unstack(level_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # This case corresponds to single-level unstacking
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle both single-level and multi-level column unstacking.

This modified function should be able to pass the failing tests provided.
