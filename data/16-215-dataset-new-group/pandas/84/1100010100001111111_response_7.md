The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the manipulation of the `clocs` variable to identify the levels in a MultiIndex. The function is not appropriately handling the hierarchical column multi-index, as indicated in the GitHub issue. This results in a failure when trying to unstack using tuple names.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the usage of tuple names for unstacking.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple names into their respective levels
    cnames = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        level = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        cnames.append(index.names[level])

    # Perform unstacking
    unstacked = data.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should handle the unstacking properly with tuple names and resolve the issue presented in the GitHub report. After applying this fix, the function should handle unstacking operations correctly on hierarchical columns.
