Based on the runtime values and the expected values for the failing test cases, it seems that the problem arises from the way the function is handling the multi-level indices. The bug occurs when the function attempts to unstack the dataframe with multi-level indices. The issue in the GitHub description, where unstacking with tuple names fails with a KeyError, supports this observation.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` should be modified to correctly process multi-level indices and handle the unstacking operation for the specified levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the input data
    index = data.index
    
    # Get the level numbers of the specified clocs
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Get the levels and codes for the specified clocs and rlocs
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Handle the unstacking operation based on the types of data
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = [ccodes[0]]

    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = ccodes

    # Create a new MultiIndex with the unstacked columns
    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with unstacking for multi-level indices by appropriately handling unstacking for both Series and DataFrames. The `clocs` are used to specify the levels for unstacking, and the new MultiIndex is created based on these levels for the unstacked result.

With these changes, the function should now correctly process the unstacking operation for multi-level indices and resolve the issue that was reported on GitHub.
