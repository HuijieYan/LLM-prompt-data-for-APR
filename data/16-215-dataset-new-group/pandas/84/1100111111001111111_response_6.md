Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, it appears that the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing when attempting to handle MultiIndexed unstack operation with tuple names.

The bug seems to stem from the reordering of level numbers represented as tuples. When creating the new MultiIndex, it does not handle the tuple names correctly, leading to KeyError and ValueError issues.

To fix this bug, modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle tuple names when creating new MultiIndex during the unstack operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_reconstructed = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_reconstructed]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs_reconstructed]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs_reconstructed]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs_reconstructed]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
    ...
    return unstacked
```

By reconstructing `clocs` based on whether they are tuples, and using the reconstructed `clocs` to fetch level numbers from the index, we can address the tuple name unstack failure. This approach should then allow the creation of the new MultiIndex correctly, resolving the issues stated in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
