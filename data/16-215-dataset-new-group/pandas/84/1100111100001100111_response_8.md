The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect `clocs` assignment and the subsequent level indexing issue. The provided input examples and the GitHub issue suggest that `clocs` is meant to be a tuple representing the levels to unstack. However, in the buggy function, `clocs` is being transformed into a list of level numbers, which is incorrect. This transformation causes problems when processing further operations on the multi-index objects.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should directly use the input `clocs` tuple instead of transforming it into a list of level numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    rlocs = tuple(i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs)
    clevels = [index.levels[index._get_level_number(c)] for c in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[index._get_level_number(c)] for c in clocs]
    cnames = list(clocs)
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In this corrected version, the `clocs` tuple is directly used in a loop to get the required levels, codes, and names, without transforming it into a list of level numbers. This modification addresses the bug and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

This fix ensures that the levels specified in the input `clocs` tuple are directly used to extract the relevant information from the multi-index objects, thus enabling proper unstacking operations.
