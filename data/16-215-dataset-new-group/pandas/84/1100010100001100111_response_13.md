The issue seems to occur when trying to unstack a Series with multiple index levels, using a tuple of names as the level parameter. The problem arises from the "_unstack_multiple" function in the pandas library. The function seems to have issues when dealing with MultiIndex columns, resulting in incorrect operations and returning an erroneous unstacked object.

The bug may be occurring due to how the function defines and processes the "clocs" variable, which is used to determine the levels to be unstacked. The function incorrectly identifies the levels leading to the wrong unpacking of data and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the relevant variable manipulation logic in the "_unstack_multiple" function needs to be addressed. Specifically, the way the "clocs" variable is processed needs to be reviewed and possibly revised to correctly identify the levels to be unstacked.

Here's the corrected version of the "_unstack_multiple" function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, pd.MultiIndex):        
        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

        if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
            unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

        return unstacked
    else:
        # Handle non-MultiIndex data
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the data has a MultiIndex. If it does, it directly uses the "unstack" method on the data, with the specified levels. This addresses the incorrect processing of MultiIndex columns and helps avoid errors.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide accurate unstacking for multi-indexed data.
