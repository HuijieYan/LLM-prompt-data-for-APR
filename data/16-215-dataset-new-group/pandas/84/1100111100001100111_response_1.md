The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the way the function handles the index and column data and manipulates it during the unstacking process. The function is intended to perform the unstacking operation on a DataFrame, transforming it from a long to a wide format.

The bug is detected to be originating from the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line within the `_unstack_multiple` function. This line is trying to get the level number for each of the given column locations (`clocs`), but it doesn't handle the case where the columns have a MultiIndex with multiple levels, leading to a KeyError.

To resolve the bug, the function should correctly identify the levels involved, create a new MultiIndex with properly stacked levels, then unstack based on the desired levels. The correct level handling should account for the MultiIndex structure and the specific levels to be unstacked.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify index
    index = data.index
    all_levels = index.names

    # Filter the levels involved
    levels_to_unstack = [level for level in all_levels if level in clocs]

    # Ensure consistent type for 'levels_to_unstack'
    if isinstance(levels_to_unstack, tuple):
        levels_to_unstack = list(levels_to_unstack)
    else:
        levels_to_unstack = [levels_to_unstack]

    # Perform unstacking using the identified levels
    unstacked = data.unstack(level=levels_to_unstack, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version correctly handles the identification of the levels to unstack and then applies the unstacking operation according to the specified levels, accounting for MultiIndex structures and multiple levels.

By resolving this bug, the function should now work as expected, addressing the issue highlighted in the GitHub discussion.
