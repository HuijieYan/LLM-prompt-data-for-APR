The bug lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the code that leads to the re-indexing of the `data` variable.

The problem arises from _unstack_multiple function's inability to handle cases with hierarchical columns (a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns).

The strategy to fix the bug would involve the following steps:
1. Enhance the logic for handling DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.
2. Modify the generation of `dummy_index` and `new_columns` based on the structure of the MultiIndex columns and its respective levels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Extract the indices for the remaining columns
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Divide the list of locations based on their types (in this case single elements or tuples)
    if not isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # in case it's not a tuple, convert it to a list with a single tuple

    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs[0]]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    clevel_codes, clevel_names = zip(*[(index.codes[i], index.levels[i]) for i in clocs[0]])
    rlevel_codes, rlevel_names = zip(*[(index.codes[i], index.levels[i]) for i in rlocs])

    # Generate MultiIndex for the dummy DataFrame
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevel_names + clevel_names,
        codes=rlevel_codes + clevel_codes,
        names=rnames + cnames,
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    # Create the dummy DataFrame
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    # Unstack the dummy DataFrame
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(list(cnames), fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function is more capable of handling the hierarchical columns, converting the `data` to a dummy DataFrame with the right indexing, and then unstacking it according to the `clocs` passed.
