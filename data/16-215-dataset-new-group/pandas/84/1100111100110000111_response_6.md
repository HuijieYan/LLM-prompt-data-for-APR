The issue appears to be with the `_get_level_number` function of the Index class. The `index._get_level_number(i)` is throwing a KeyError or ValueError.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` function is unable to find the level when the passed level is a tuple. This is evident from the error message that includes the line `raise KeyError('Level %s not found' % str(level))`. Additionally, the error message includes the line `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`, indicating an issue with `level` when it cannot be found in the list.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified in the `_unstack_multiple` function where it is calling `index._get_level_number(i)` for each `i` in `clocs`. This call is failing when `i` is a tuple, and this needs to be handled correctly. The modified code should accommodate the case when a tuple is passed as the `i`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_levels = []
    for i in clocs:
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            # Handle the case when i is a tuple
            cloc_levels.append([index._get_level_number(j) for j in i])
        else:
            cloc_levels.append(index._get_level_number(i))

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the code checks if the `i` is a tuple. If it is, it processes the individual elements of the tuple and appends the result to `cloc_levels`. This modification should address the KeyError or ValueError caused by the inability to find the level.
