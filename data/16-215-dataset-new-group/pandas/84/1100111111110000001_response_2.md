## Analyzing the buggy function

The `_unstack_multiple` function has an issue when attempting to obtain the level number for each value in the `clocs` list. This error is leading to ValueError and KeyError during execution.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations are with the process of getting the level number for each value in the `clocs` list using `index._get_level_number(i)`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is that when attempting to get the level number in the `clocs` list, the function is encountering issues with handling MultiIndex and failing to retrieve the specific level number.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the function properly retrieves the level number for each value in the `clocs` list, especially in the context of MultiIndex. The use of `index._get_level_number(i)` should be reviewed, and alternative methods for handling MultiIndex should be considered.

## The corrected version of the function

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_nums = [index.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_nums]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_nums]
    
    # Rest of the code
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we use the `get_loc` method to obtain the location of a specific value in the index. This approach will ensure that we get appropriate level numbers for MultiIndex when obtaining `cloc_nums`.
