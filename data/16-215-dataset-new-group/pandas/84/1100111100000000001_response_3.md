The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` has multiple potential error locations. One potential error is in the `if isinstance(data, Series):` block, where the `unstack` method is called on `dummy`. Another potential error is in the `else` block, where it checks if `data.columns` is a `MultiIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when `data` is a `Series` or when `data.columns` is a `MultiIndex`. This causes the function to return incorrect results or raise errors.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where `data` is a `Series` and when `data.columns` is a `MultiIndex` separately within the function. We can achieve this by refactoring the code to explicitly handle these cases with appropriate logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the code has been simplified to eliminate the separate handling of cases for `Series` and `MultiIndex` columns. The logic has been consolidated to handle both cases with the same code. This reduces the potential for errors and makes the function more maintainable.
