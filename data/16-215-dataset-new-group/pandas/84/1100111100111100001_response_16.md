Looking at the error message and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue is with the variable `clocs`. The error message indicates a problem with the variable `level`, which is a result of `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. It looks like the values in `clocs` are not being handled correctly.

The `clocs` variable should contain the level names of the multi-index. From the error message, it seems that 'A' is not being recognized as a valid level name. This could be due to the fact that `index._get_level_number(i)` is not properly retrieving the level number for 'A'. 

Based on this analysis, the issue seems to be with how the level names are processed and converted into level numbers. It could be that the multi-index structure is not being correctly handled when retrieving level numbers.

To fix this bug, a strategy will be to ensure that the conversion from level names to level numbers is correctly handled. This might involve reviewing the way that the `clocs` parameter is processed and how level names are retrieved and related to their corresponding level numbers.

Given the analysis, the corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, the buggy logic related to level numbers and names is replaced with a simplified approach to handle the `clocs` parameter and directly retrieve the necessary levels from the index. This should address the issue of incorrect retrieval of level numbers and should resolve the bug.
