The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing a `KeyError` when trying to find the index of a level. This is due to the fact that the function is expecting the level names as strings, but in the failing tests, the level names are provided as tuples.

Here's a modified version of the function that fixes this issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    locs = [index._get_level_number(level) if isinstance(level, str) else level for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in locs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in locs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in locs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in locs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(locs)):
                val = locs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                locs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in locs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the modified function, we handle a case where the input levels could be either strings or tuples representing the levels. If it's a tuple, we don't try to translate it to an index, and just use it as is. This will fix the issue identified by the failing tests, and ensure that the levels are correctly parsed.

This corrected version of the function should pass both the failing tests provided.
