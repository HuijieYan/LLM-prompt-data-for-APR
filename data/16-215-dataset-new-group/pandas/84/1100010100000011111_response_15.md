The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` appears to be breaking while trying to shift or unstack a single level of rows index. This result is observed through the provided expected values and types of variables.
The issue on GitHub confirms that shifting or unstacking a single level is not working correctly and is resulting in a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is related to the 'clocs' variable. The function attempts to find the index of the specified level in the MultiIndex using the `_get_level_number` method, and this process seems to be causing an issue.

To fix this bug, a strategy would involve updating the implementation to handle the unstacking of a single level of the MultiIndex correctly. The function `_unstack_multiple` should be able to identify and extract the names and levels of each index, and then unstack the specified level.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Retain the original indices for unstacking
    orig_index = list(index.names)
    orig_levels = index.levels
    orig_codes = index.codes

    # Extract the level to be unstacked
    to_unstack_name = index.names[clocs[0]]
    to_unstack_level = index._get_level_number(to_unstack_name)

    # Reset to default index
    data = data.reset_index()

    # Unstack the specified level
    unstacked = data.unstack(level=to_unstack_level, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Restore the original indices
    unstacked.columns = orig_index + [c[1] for c in unstacked.columns]

    # Convert back to a MultiIndex
    unstacked = unstacked.set_index(orig_index)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version of the function is updated to handle the unstacking process properly, including retaining the original indices and returning the correct MultiIndex structure.

This fix should address the issue identified on GitHub and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
