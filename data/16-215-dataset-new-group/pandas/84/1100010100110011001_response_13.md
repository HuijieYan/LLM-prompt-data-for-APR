The main issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it tries to retrieve the level number for a given column (clocs) based on the index level names. However, the code is mistakenly trying to find a single level name when the actual structure involves a MultiIndex. This is causing the error messages related to 'ValueError' or 'KeyError' when trying to find the level.

To fix this bug, we need to explicitly update how the level numbers are retrieved with the correct logic for a MultiIndex structure.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Replace the old method to get the level number in case of MultiIndex
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

By updating the logic to fetch the level number based on whether the index structure is a MultiIndex or not, the corrected version should address the ValueError and KeyError issues encountered in the failing tests.
