The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used for unstacking a MultiIndex DataFrame. The error message indicates that there is an issue when trying to get the level number of a given level. The error message is specific: it says "Level A not found" and "A is not in list". This suggests that the function `get_level_number` is unable to find the level 'A' in the MultiIndex.

The cause of the bug could be that the input `clocs` is incorrect and does not correspond to valid levels in the MultiIndex. This leads to an attempt to find non-existing levels, causing the KeyError and ValueError.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to verify that the levels specified in `clocs` are valid levels in the MultiIndex before attempting to retrieve their level numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    for loc in clocs:
        if loc not in index.names:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {loc} not found")  # Verify that the levels in clocs are valid

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, after verifying that each level in `clocs` exists in the MultiIndex, the function proceeds to retrieve their level numbers using `index._get_level_number`. This ensures that the input levels are valid, addressing the issue encountered due to incorrect level specification.
