The issue posted on GitHub involves a bug with the `unstack` function for MultiIndexed series. The specific scenario that the bug relates to is when unstacking a MultiIndexed series and calling `unstack(("A", "a"))`. The error message is a KeyError, stating "Level A not found".

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the handling of the tuple names ("A", "a") when passing it to the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Identifying a way to correctly handle the tuple names within the `_unstack_multiple` function.
2. Ensuring that the appropriate level numbers are derived from the tuple names.
3. Reviewing the handling of hierarchical columns during the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Updated handling of hierarchical columns (if applicable)
    if isinstance(data, Series) and isinstance(data.index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = list(data.index.names).index(clocs)  # Adjusted to handle tuple names

    # Retrieve the index
    index = data.index

    # Get level number for the tuple names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
}
```
In this corrected version, the function first checks if the input data is a Series and if the index is a MultiIndex. If so, it retrieves the level numbers for the tuple names with the adjusted handling. If the input data is not a Series or does not have a MultiIndex index, it proceeds with the existing logic.

This updated function should address the KeyError issue and handle the tuple names appropriately when passed to the `_unstack_multiple` function.
