The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is around extracting and utilizing the level numbers. The function fails to properly index the `MultiIndex` object's levels using tuple names in some cases, leading to the `KeyError` or `ValueError` as explained in the provided console log and GitHub issue respectively.

The solution to fixing this is to correctly handle the extraction of levels based on the provided tuple names. This includes modifying the `_get_level_number` method to extract level numbers based on tuple names. Then, extract the level numbers using the extracted tuples when calling the `_get_level_number` method for indexing.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex

    def _get_level_number(index, names):
        index_names = index.names if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) else [index.name]
        try:
            if len(names) == 1:
                return index_names.index(names[0])
            else:
                level_hiers = set()
                for name in names:
                    level_hiers.add(index_names.index(name))
                return tuple(sorted(level_hiers))
        except ValueError:
            if not isinstance(names, int):
                raise ValueError(f"The name {names} occurs in the MultiIndex, use a level number")

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    [rest of the function remains unchanged]
```

With these changes, the bug should be fixed and the function will be able to correctly handle tuple names in `MultiIndex` `unstack()` method, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub issue and the failing test cases.
