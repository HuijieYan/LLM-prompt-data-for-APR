The bug appears to be related to how the levels, codes, and names are being handled in the `pandas.core.reshape.reshape._unstack_multiple` function. Specifically, when dealing with multi-level indices, the function fails to correctly construct new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame. As a result, the function is unable to accurately unstack the input DataFrame.

A potential strategy for fixing this bug would involve revisiting the logic for constructing the new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame. Additionally, ensuring that the function handles multi-level indices correctly, and the resulting DataFrame has the appropriate structure according to the expected output would resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(
        [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs], shape, sort=False, xnull=False
    )

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [index.get_level_values(i) for i in rlocs] + [obs_ids],
        names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=clevels + [index.get_level_values(i) for i in rlocs] + [obs_ids],
        names=cnames + [index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
    )

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version iterates through the levels of the index to construct new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame. It also uses the `get_level_values` function to build the new columns MultiIndex, ensuring that the resulting DataFrame accurately reflects the unstacked data. This should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
