The GitHub issue describes a problem where using the unstack() function with tuple names results in a KeyError. The GitHub issue helps to identify that the issue is related to the function `_unstack_multiple` from the same file, `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`.

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be the source of the problem. The KeyError is occurring when trying to get the level number for a specific label in the index. This occurs during the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This may indicate that the label `i` in the index is not valid, causing the KeyError. Also, the GitHub issue demonstrated that the `unstack()` is being called with tuple names, which isn't being handled properly in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

To fix this bug, we should validate the input for the labels `clocs` and handle tuple names correctly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert to list if not already

        # Need to handle tuple label names correctly
        if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
            clocs = [(level,) if not isinstance(level, tuple) else level for level in clocs]
        else:
            clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

        clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
        cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

        # Rest of the function body...
    else:
        # Handle single level index here
        # Rest of the function body...
```
