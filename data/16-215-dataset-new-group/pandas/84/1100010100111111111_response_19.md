Based on the failed tests and the expected behavior, it seems that the issue may be related to the `_get_level_number` method of the index. 

The `_get_level_number` method is supposed to return the level number for a given level name. The failure indicates that the method does not correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug:
1. Replace the problematic section of the `_get_level_number` method to explicitly handle tuple names in MultiIndex.
2. Ensure that all relevant data structures and variables used in the unstacking process are handled correctly when dealing with MultiIndex and tuple names.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(level, names):
        if not isinstance(level, int):
            level = names.index(level)
        return level

    clocs = [get_level_number(i, index.names) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

This correction adds a custom handling of the index level names within the `_unstack_multiple` function, addressing the failure related to tuple names in the MultiIndex.

After applying this correction, rerun the failing tests to ensure that the corrected function now passes all the tests.
