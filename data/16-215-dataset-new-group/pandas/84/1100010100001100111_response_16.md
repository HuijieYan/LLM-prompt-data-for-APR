The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be caused by an issue with handling of hierarchical columns in the `pandas` library. The bug is triggered when attempting to unstack a DataFrame with a `MultiIndex` and the level names are provided as a tuple, leading to a `KeyError`.

In the provided cases, we see that the code is invoking a combination of operations related to reshaping the DataFrame with a `MultiIndex`, unstacking it, and re-indexing based on new grouped indexes, some of which seem incorrect. Specifically, the use of the `unstack` method within the function and manipulation of dummy variables consists of multiple conditions with the possibility of unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, one possible strategy is to simplify and standardize the process of reshaping, unstacking, and re-indexing the DataFrame with a MultiIndex, ensuring that the correct multi-level columns are created and indexed.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    import pandas as pd

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        # No levels remaining after removing clocs
        dummy_index = pd.Index(range(len(ccodes[0])), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(
            rcodes + ccodes, names=rnames + cnames + ['__placeholder__']
        )

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value).swaplevel(0, -1, axis=1)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the process of reshaping and unstacking the DataFrame is simplified. The creation of a `dummy_index` and the subsequent unstacking are performed with consideration for multi-level columns and indices.

This corrected version should address the bug triggered when attempting to unstack the DataFrame with a `MultiIndex` using the level names provided as a tuple.
