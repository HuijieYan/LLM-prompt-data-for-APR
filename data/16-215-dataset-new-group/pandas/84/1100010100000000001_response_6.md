## Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack multiple levels of a hierarchical index in a pandas DataFrame. It appears to have multiple potential error locations, including the handling of hierarchical columns, the creation of a dummy index, and the unstacking process itself.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the function may arise from the improper handling of hierarchical columns, which can lead to incorrect unstacking and indexing of the resulting DataFrame. Additionally, the creation and assignment of the dummy index may not be done correctly, causing issues with unstacking.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of hierarchical columns is done properly, and the creation and assignment of the dummy index is done correctly. Additionally, we need to ensure that the unstacking process is carried out accurately to avoid any potential errors.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical index columns
    index = data.index
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # Handle remaining levels and create new MultiIndex
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    # Create dummy DataFrame with new MultiIndex and unstack
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    # Set new columns and return unstacked DataFrame
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=clevels + [unstacked.columns.levels[0]],
        codes=ccodes + [unstacked.columns.codes[-1]],
        names=cnames + [unstacked.columns.name],
        verify_integrity=False
    )
    unstacked.columns = new_columns
    return unstacked
```
In the corrected version of the function, we handle the hierarchical index columns and create a new MultiIndex for the remaining levels. We then create a dummy DataFrame with the new MultiIndex and unstack it. Finally, we set the new columns and return the unstacked DataFrame. This version addresses potential errors and provides a more accurate unstacking process.
