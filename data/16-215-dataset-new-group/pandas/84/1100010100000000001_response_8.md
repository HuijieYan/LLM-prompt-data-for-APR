The main issue with the provided function seems to be the complexity of the logic and potential errors related to variable reassignments and conditional statements. The function aims to unstack hierarchical data, but the nested conditional statements and variable mutation make it difficult to follow and prone to errors.

One potential cause of the bug in the function is the reassignment of the variable `clocs` inside the conditional block which changes the loop index. This might lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to simplify the logic and eliminate the reassignments of key variables to ensure clarity and reduce the potential for errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack()
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the function has been simplified to focus on unstacking the data based on the provided `clocs` while handling the hierarchical index. The complex conditional statements and variable reassignments have been removed to reduce the potential for errors.
