Based on the runtime input/output variable values, we can see that the bug is likely occurring due to the implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The following issues are observed:
1. Inconsistent handling of single versus multi-level index data in the if-else condition. The implementation treats single and multi-level index data differently leading to different execution paths.
2. Incorrect handling of column indices in the `data` when creating `unstacked`.

Suggested Fix:
1. Standardize the handling of single and multi-level index data by unstacking data using the correct approach for both cases.
2. Correct creation of `unstacked` based on the type of `data` being a Series or DataFrame is necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = ccodes
    else:
        dummy = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + ccodes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(dummy, Series):
        dummy.index = new_columns
    else:
        dummy.columns = new_columns

    return dummy
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of single and multi-level index data and properly constructs the `unstacked` DataFrame based on the type of `data`.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
