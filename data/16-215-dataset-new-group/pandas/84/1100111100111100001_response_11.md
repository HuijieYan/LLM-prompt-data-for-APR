The bug occurs within the `_unstack_multiple` function where it attempts to retrieve the level number for the input `clocs` by calling the `_get_level_number` method of the index object. This operation fails because the `level` parameter is a tuple, which is not found in the list of levels.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the input to the `_get_level_number` method so that it can handle multi-level indexing. Additionally, we should handle the case where the `data` input is a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle hierarchical column levels
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    cnames = []
    for loc in clocs:
        level = index._get_level_number(loc)
        cnames.append(loc)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
    else:
        dummy = data.copy(deep=False)

    dummy.columns = dummy.columns.remove_unused_levels()
    dummy = dummy.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)

    return dummy
```

With this correction, the function is now capable of handling multi-level indexing and multi-level column names. This should resolve the key errors observed in the failing test cases.
