The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be related to how it handles the input `clocs` to determine the columns to unstack. The function does not take into account the possibility of multiple levels of column indexing. This is evident from the incorrect application of `clocs` to columns.

The bug fix strategy involves correcting the retrieval of column names, codes, and levels from the index, and handling the unstacking of multi-level columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if len(clocs) == 1:
        clocs = [(clocs,)]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case where multiple levels of columns need to be unstacked. Here, we account for the possibility of a tuple within `clocs` and appropriately convert it to the corresponding level numbers. This way, the function will correctly handle multi-level column indexing.
