### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `clocs` variable is used to represent expected column locations, but it's not being handled correctly.
2. The function attempts to handle both single and multi-indexes but ends up causing the error in multi-index scenarios.
3. The error is caused due to incorrect identification of column levels and not handling hierarchical columns properly.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the GitHub issue information:
The function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to handle the unstacking of a multi-index or a single-index, but it fails when dealing with multi-index scenarios where the column names are multi-level tuples. The `clocs` used to represent column locations are not being handled correctly, leading to issues with level identification and processing.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles multi-level column (multi-index) scenarios in unstacking.
2. Properly handle the hierarchical columns while identifying levels and their locations.
3. Update the processing logic to account for multi-level column names in multi-index scenarios.

### Provide a corrected version:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Process multi-level column (multi-index) scenario
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        target_level = tuple(clocs)
        if target_level not in data.columns.names:
            raise KeyError(f'Level {target_level} not found')
            
        # Directly unstack the data based on the specified levels
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
    else:
        index = data.index
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        # rest of the original code
        # ...
```

In the corrected version:
- For multi-level column (multi-index) scenarios, check if the target level is present in the column names, and handle direct unstacking of the data based on the specified levels.
- For single-level column scenarios, proceed with the original processing logic as implemented in the rest of the function.

By updating the implementation to explicitly handle multi-level column names in a multi-index scenario, the corrected version should resolve the issue and improve the unstacking function's behavior.
