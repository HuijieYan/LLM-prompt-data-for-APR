This function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a DataFrame or a Series with a MultiIndex. However, it has a bug that causes it to fail in certain cases, as indicated by the GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The bug is caused by an error in handling the input parameters and in the intermediate variable calculations.

The bug seems to occur in the code that computes various variables such as `clocs`, `rlocs`, `clevels`, `ccodes`, etc. and how these variables are used to create `dummy_index`, `unstacked`, `new_levels`, `new_names`, `new_codes`, and `unstcols`. The error handling the hierarchical columns is mentioned in the comments but still contains a bug in the implementation.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the computed and used variables are consistent with the actual structure and values stored in the input DataFrame or Series with a MultiIndex. The correction should include adjusting the computation of level numbers, names, and codes for the MultiIndex.

The fixed version of the function `_unstack_multiple` is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    obs_ids = np.arange(len(index))
    if not clocs:
        new_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        new_index = MultiIndex.from_product([obs_ids] + [index.levels[i] for i in clocs])
        obs_labels = [index.labels[i] for i in clocs] + [None]
        new_index = new_index.set_labels(obs_labels)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = new_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        new_levels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        new_names = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        new_codes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = new_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        code_info = [(unstacked.index.labels[i], unstacked.index.levels[i]) for i in range(len(clocs))]
        new_levels = [info[1] for info in code_info]
        new_names = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        new_codes = [info[0] for info in code_info]

    new_names = ["__placeholder__"] + new_names
    new_levels = [obs_ids] + new_levels
    new_codes = [np.arange(len(obs_ids))] + new_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays(new_codes, names=new_names)

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
This corrected function includes using the correct objects and methods to manipulate the MultiIndex, ensuring the consistency and correctness of the operations performed on the MultiIndex to prevent the bug described in the GitHub issue.
