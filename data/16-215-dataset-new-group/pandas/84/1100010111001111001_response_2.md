I will fix the function _unstack_multiple based on the runtime values and the expected values during the failing test cases. The issue is likely occurring in the part of the code that handles multi-level indexing. 

The bug appears to stem from incorrect handling of multi-level indexing. The function should correctly handle the multi-level index and unstacking process to produce the expected output.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs:  # If there are rlocs
        rindex = index.droplevel(clocs)

        unstacked = data.set_index([rindex] + [index.get_level_values(c) for c in clocs]).unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:  # If everything is in clocs
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
