Looks like the _get_level_number function is unable to handle multiple levels of the MultiIndex, resulting in a ValueError. The root cause seems to be that the function is not handling hierarchical columns correctly.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug includes modifying the _get_level_number function to handle MultiIndex with multiple levels properly.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_level_number function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Assume clocs is a list of tuples for each level
    clocs = [tuple(index._get_level_number(i) for i in loc) if isinstance(loc, tuple) else index._get_level_number(loc) for loc in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

In this corrected version, we've updated the line to handle the case where clocs is a list of tuples for each level of MultiIndex. This should allow the function to correctly handle MultiIndex with multiple levels, thus fixing the bug.
