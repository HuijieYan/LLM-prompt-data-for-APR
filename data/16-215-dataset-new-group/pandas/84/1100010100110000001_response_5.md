The error message from the failing test highlighted a KeyError problem.

Looking into the buggy function provided, the `_unstack_multiple` function accesses the MultiIndex attribute using `_get_level_number`. The error suggests that the 'A' key is not found when trying to access by index. This is causing the KeyError or ValueError.

To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that the 'A' level is valid and exists in the MultiIndex. A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to check the existence of the level 'A' in the MultiIndex before accessing it using index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        level_number_map = {name: index._get_level_number(i) for i, name in enumerate(index.names)}
        try:
            clocs = [level_number_map[c] for c in clocs]
        except KeyError as e:
            level_not_found = e.args[0]
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level_not_found} not found")

        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
        # Rest of the code remains the same
    else:
        raise ValueError("The input index should be a MultiIndex type.")

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```
In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that the level being accessed is valid and is present in the MultiIndex before proceeding with further operations. Additionally, we provided a safeguard to raise an error if the input index is not a MultiIndex type to improve the robustness of the function.

This corrected function should resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues when trying to access the level in the MultiIndex.
