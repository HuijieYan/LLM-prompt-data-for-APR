The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the iteration of level indices within the MultiIndex. The main problem seems to stem from the lines:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
```
Here, the `index._get_level_number()` method is used to get the level number, but it's throwing a value error, leading to subsequent problems in the function. The issue is being caused by the input values coming from the test cases that don't align with the needed format by the function.

To resolve the aforementioned error, we can directly assign the level numbers of the `clocs` as well as use `dict.get` to handle nonexistent keys, thereby avoiding the value error.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function. It should address the problems encountered in the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(cloc) if index._get_level_number(cloc) is not None else index.names.index(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Update the clocs and rlocs to the converted number format
    clocs = cloc_numbers
    rlocs = rloc_numbers

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining parts of the function remain the same as the original.

    ...
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the input from the test cases without raising a KeyError, and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
