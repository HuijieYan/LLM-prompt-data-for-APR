Based on the function name (_unstack_multiple), it seems it's related to unstacking a multi-index, which is also indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue about unstacking a multi-index. The failing test cases test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex and test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex are related to unstacking multi-index, and the GitHub issue also deals with KeyErrors related to unstacking multi-index.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are where `clocs` and `index._get_level_number(i)` are used.

The cause of the bug is that the `index._get_level_number(i)` method seems to be failing to find the given level in the multi-index, leading to KeyErrors. This is further evidenced by the provided GitHub issue which also deals with KeyErrors when attempting to unstack a multi-index.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the `index._get_level_number(i)` method properly finds the given level in the multi-index. This may involve making sure that the input `clocs` are valid levels in the multi-index before using them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]  # Ensure the input levels are valid

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains as it is...
```

By checking if the given level is a valid string or tuple before passing it to `index._get_level_number(i)`, we ensure that only valid levels in the multi-index are being used, thereby fixing the bug.
