The issue arises from the `_get_level_number` function, where the provided level is not found due to the mismatch in expected values. The `clocs` variable is not correctly being set, leading to an incorrect slicing of the index. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` variable is correctly represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the hierarchical levels in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # If clocs is a tuple of levels (for MultiIndex)
    if not isinstance(clocs[0], (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (the rest of the original function)
```

This corrected function checks if the `clocs` variable is a tuple of levels (for MultiIndex) and converts it to a list of tuples if necessary. This ensures that the slicing of the index is conducted correctly and the unstacking operation works as expected.

This fix will address the issue from the provided GitHub report and provides a more robust unstacking operation for multi-indexed data.
