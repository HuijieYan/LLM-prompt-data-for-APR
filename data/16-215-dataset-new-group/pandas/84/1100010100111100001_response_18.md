The issue is most likely occurring in the `_get_level_number` function, which is called inside the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error messages indicate that the level 'A' is not found, suggesting an issue with the data index's level names.

One potential strategy to fix the bug is to check for the names of the levels in the data index and ensure that they are correctly assigned before using them in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        # Convert clocs from a tuple of level names to a list of level numbers
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

        # Rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
        
        return unstacked
    else:
        raise ValueError("Index is not MultiIndex")

```

By explicitly checking if the index is a MultiIndex and ensuring that `clocs` is converted to a list of level numbers, the corrected version should resolve the issue. This change addresses the potential mismatch between the level names and level numbers in the `clocs` input.
