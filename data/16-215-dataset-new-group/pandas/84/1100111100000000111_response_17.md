The problem occurs when executing the `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` line of code because the level `("A", "a")` is not recognized; this is causing the `KeyError` to be raised. When being executed, the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is called by the `unstack` function with the specified level problem. The `_unstack_multiple` function is unable to handle the provided level, leading to the error.

To resolve this issue, it may be necessary to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the multilevels. By ensuring the function can properly identify the levels and handle it accordingly, the error should be resolved.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, level, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
        level = [level]

    # Get the level numbers
    level_numbers = [data.index._get_level_number(l) for l in level]

    # Validate that all levels are found in the index
    if not all(isinstance(ln, int) for ln in level_numbers):
        raise KeyError(f'Level(s) {level} not found in the index')

    # Extract remaining levels
    rest_levels = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]
    rest_level_names = [data.index.names[i] for i in rest_levels]
    rest_level_levels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in rest_levels]
    rest_level_codes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in rest_levels]

    # Unstack the DataFrame
    unstacked_data = data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)

    # If the result is a Series
    if isinstance(unstacked_data, Series):
        unstacked_levels = unstacked_data.index.levels
        unstacked_codes = unstacked_data.index.codes
        new_levels = unstacked_levels + rest_level_levels
        new_codes = unstacked_codes + rest_level_codes
        new_names = [unstacked_data.index.names[i] if i < len(unstacked_data.index.names) else rest_level_names[i - len(unstacked_data.index.names)] for i in range(len(new_levels))]
        unstacked_data.index = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names)

    # If the result is a DataFrame
    else:
        unstacked_levels = unstacked_data.columns.levels
        unstacked_codes = unstacked_data.columns.codes
        new_levels = rest_level_levels + unstacked_levels
        new_codes = rest_level_codes + unstacked_codes
        new_names = [rest_level_names[i] if i < len(rest_level_names) else unstacked_data.columns.names[i - len(rest_level_names)] for i in range(len(new_levels))]
        unstacked_data.columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names)

    return unstacked_data
```

In the corrected code, we check if the level is provided as a list or a tuple and then proceed to get the level numbers. For each level, we validate that it exists, and then proceed to perform the unstacking operation. Finally, based on the result being a Series or a DataFrame, we construct the new index or column levels and codes accordingly.

This updated version of the function should resolve the issue as reported in the GitHub issue.
