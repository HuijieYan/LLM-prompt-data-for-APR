The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function is occurring due to incorrect handling of the 'clocs' input parameter, which leads to an error in the functioning of the MultiIndex class's `_get_level_number` method. The incorrect handling is causing the buggy function to return incorrect values. 

The root cause of the bug is that the 'clocs' (column locations) input parameter is passed as a tuple, but the function uses it as a list in some internal computations without proper validation.

The buggy function should be modified to correctly handle the 'clocs' input parameter by ensuring that it is always treated as a list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Existing code that doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Remaining code...
```

By ensuring that the 'clocs' input parameter is always treated as a list, we can address the root cause of the bug where it was incorrectly used as a tuple in some internal computations. This update will fix the buggy behavior of the function.

With this fix in place, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now pass the failing test cases, as provided.
