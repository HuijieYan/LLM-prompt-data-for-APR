The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` occurs due to the incorrect handling of multi-index values in the `clocs` parameter. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to retrieve the level numbers from the index. The bug appears to manifest in various forms, leading to errors associated with incorrect index references and level names.

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` should be updated to properly handle multi-index values and retrieve the correct level numbers from the index. The `clocs` parameter should be appropriately processed to ensure that the level numbers are correctly accessed from the index.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Updated handling of hierarchical columns
    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, tuple) else index._get_level_number((c,)) for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
    # ...
```

The updated code explicitly handles the situation when `clocs` is a tuple and attempts to get the level numbers by accounting for tuple values. After the update, the function should have the correct behavior when processing multi-index values and identify the level numbers accurately.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and is expected to resolve the problems related to unstacking multi-index values.
