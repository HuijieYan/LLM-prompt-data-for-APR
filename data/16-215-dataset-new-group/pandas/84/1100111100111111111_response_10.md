## Correction of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function

The error in the `_unstack_multiple` function is occurring when attempting to handle a multi-index unstack operation. The function is not correctly handling the case where column locations are specified as a tuple. Additionally, there is an issue with the way the level numbers are being computed, leading to incorrect inputs for the subsequent unstacking operation. 

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where column locations are specified as a tuple and perform the level number calculation accurately. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    positional_clocs = []  # Convert tuple-style clocs to positional indices
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        else:
            cloc = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        positional_clocs.append(cloc)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in positional_clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # Existing code goes here
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the tuple-style `clocs` is handled using the `index._get_level_number` function to convert it to the corresponding positional index. This ensures that the correct level numbers are used for further processing.

After making this change, the function should be able to correctly handle multi-index unstack operations, and the failing tests should pass.
