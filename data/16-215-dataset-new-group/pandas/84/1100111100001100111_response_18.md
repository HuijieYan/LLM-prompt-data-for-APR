The error is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function which is attempting to unstack a multi-index DataFrame but is failing when trying to determine the level numbers for the given index names. 

The cause of the bug appears to be that the `clocs` parameter is expecting a tuple of names from the MultiIndex, but the function is currently attempting to directly use the names to get their level numbers. The function should be first looking up the level numbers corresponding to the names and working with those instead.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function so that it first retrieves the level numbers for the given names from the index and then uses those level numbers to proceed with the unstacking operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    
    # Remaining code remains the same
    # ...
```

By retrieving the level numbers for the given names before using them to proceed with the unstacking operation, this corrected version should resolve the issue encountered by the user in the GitHub issue.
