After analyzing the function and the error messages, the key issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it is not checking whether the passed level names are present in the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex. Instead, it is directly assuming that the passed level names are valid, which leads to errors due to missing level names.

The function should be fixed to check whether the given level names exist in the index before trying to access them. One way to fix this issue is to use a `try-except` block to handle the errors when the level names provided to the function are not found in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_valid = [i for i in clocs if i in index.names]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs_valid]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
}
```

In the corrected version of the function, `clocs_valid` is generated to contain only the level names that exist in the index. Then, when retrieving the level numbers using `_get_level_number`, it only considers the valid level names. This ensures that the function does not encounter errors due to missing level names.

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should pass the failing test and handle the level names appropriately.
