I see that the function `_unstack_multiple` is not handling hierarchical columns properly, causing it to fail when trying to unstack multiple levels of a MultiIndex. The bug appears when the code fails to correctly handle the input and compute the expected output for the `unstack` operation.

The current implementation does not properly account for multi-level column indexing, leading to incorrect re-shaping of the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, you can modify the implementation to properly handle the multi-level columns when unstacking. You may need to update the logic for extracting the levels, codes, and names, and how they are used to reconstruct the MultiIndex after the unstack operation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    if len(level_numbers) == 1:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level_numbers[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked

    unstacked = data.unstack(level_numbers)

    return unstacked
```

This updated implementation directly uses the `unstack` method of the DataFrame, passing the correct level_numbers list when unstacking. This should properly handle the multi-level columns and resolve the bug.

After making this change, re-run the failing tests to verify that the corrected function now passes the tests. If the tests pass, it indicates that the bug has been fixed successfully.
