One of the potential locations of the error in the `_unstack_multiple` function is the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line. The cause of this bug is that the `for` loop iteration is not correctly handling hierarchical columns.

A strategy to fix the bug is to refactor the logic for handling hierarchical columns to correctly identify and process the levels within the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue with handling tuple names in MultiIndex unstack and pass the failing tests. The updates in the code are aimed at ensuring that hierarchical column levels are processed correctly.
