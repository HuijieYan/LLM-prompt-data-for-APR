There are several issues with the provided script. The `_unstack_multiple` function is supposed to unstack the input data, but the implementation is incorrect. The function is designed to handle multi-level columns but fails to do so. The function is also inconsistent in handling different types of inputs, such as `Series` and `DataFrames`. This causes the function to behave unexpectedly and produce incorrect results.

The main issue occurs when the function tries to process multi-level columns. It fails to handle the list of column locations (`clocs`) properly, which leads to errors in the unstacking process when dealing with tuple names.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the function to ensure consistent handling of different input types (e.g., `Series`, `DataFrames`) and create a unified logic for unstacking based on the column locations.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handling different input types
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unpivoted = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unpivoted = data.unstack(level=clocs)

    # Fill missing values if fill_value is specified
    if fill_value is not None:
        unpivoted = unpivoted.fillna(fill_value)

    return unpivoted
```

This revised implementation addresses the bugs and inconsistencies present in the original function by providing consistent handling for different types of input data and properly unstacking multi-level columns in both `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.
