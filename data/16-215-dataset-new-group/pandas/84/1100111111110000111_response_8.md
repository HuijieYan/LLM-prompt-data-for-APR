The cause of the bug is that the ` = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]` operation is executed on a MultiIndex. The source of the bug is that `index` is derived from the column index (which is a MultiIndex). For a DataFrame, it should be the row MultiIndex that we work against.

To fix the bug, you need to remove unnecessary operations for Series, as the operations should be sufficient for DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Fix the bug by getting the row index (not the column index for DataFrame)
    index = data.columns
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
  
  # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now work properly with multi-index DataFrame inputs.

Additionally, you should set up a test function with the provided failing test cases to ensure that the corrected function is functioning as expected.
