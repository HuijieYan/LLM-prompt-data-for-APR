The bug is caused by the incorrect interpretation of the input. The `clocs` parameter is expected to be a tuple with the level names and it is being incorrectly processed as a single level name instead of a tuple of level names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `clocs` parameter to ensure it is correctly interpreted as a tuple of level names. We also need to update how the `clocs` parameter is manipulated in the `_unstack_multiple` function, and how it is used throughout the function to properly handle multi-level indices.

Here's the updated `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains unchanged...
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle the `clocs` parameter correctly and process it as a tuple of level names, ensuring that the multi-level indices are correctly handled.

This fix addresses the issue identified in the failing test cases and should resolve the KeyError and ValueError exceptions that were being raised due to the incorrect handling of the `clocs` parameter.

After implementing this fix, the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to handle multi-level indices correctly and pass the failing tests.
