The issue in the provided GitHub report occurs when trying to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex using a tuple of level names. The function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, it should be responsible for handling the unstacking process correctly. 

However, there are inconsistencies and issues within the `_unstack_multiple` function. Firstly, we can see that the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is used to find the level numbers given the level names. The bug reported in the GitHub issue is caused by the improper handling of tuple names during the unstacking process. This led to the KeyError being raised, as the level names passed are not found.

To fix this bug, an efficient strategy is to modify the code within `_unstack_multiple` to correctly handle the tuple names when performing the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Dealing with hierarchical columns
    index = data.index

    # Find level numbers given the level names for clocs
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, (int, str)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected version of `_unstack_multiple`, we've added a condition to check whether a level name is already a number, and if it's not, then obtain the level number using `index._get_level_number`. This allows the function to correctly handle tuple names and prevents the KeyError raised by the unstacking process from occurring.
