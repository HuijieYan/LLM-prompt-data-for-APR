The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely causing the KeyError and ValueError errors through the incorrect handling of MultiIndex objects with a tuple for level names.

Upon analyzing the errors specifically and checking the input and output variables, it's clear that the issue stems from the `_unstack_multiple` function incorrectly handling MultiIndex objects when unstacking columns with tuple names. This is causing the `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` and `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` errors.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be updated to properly handle MultiIndex objects with tuple names when unstacking, and should also address the `KeyError` and `ValueError` issues.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the `clocs` list is provided with a condition to determine if an element is a tuple. If it is, the function will convert the level names to level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`; otherwise, the original element is used.

This update in the function should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing tests pass.
