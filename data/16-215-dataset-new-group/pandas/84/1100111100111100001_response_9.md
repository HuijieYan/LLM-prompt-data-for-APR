The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be caused by incorrect conversions between the hierarchical index levels. The error message indicates that the variable `clocs` should be a single level name or a level number, but the buggy function is attempting to index `clocs` using `index._get_level_number(i)`, which is causing the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the variable `clocs` is properly handled as a list of level names or level numbers before any indexing operations based on it are performed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, str):  # If clocs is a single level name
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]
    else:  # If clocs is a tuple of multiple level names
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains the same...
    
    return unstacked
```

This corrected version handles both single level names and tuples of level names in `clocs` by processing them differently. This should address the ValueError that was raised and allow the function to run without errors.
