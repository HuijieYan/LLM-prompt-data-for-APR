The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function results from mishandling the input when `clocs` parameter is a tuple, rather than a list of level identifiers (integers). This is leading to the unstacked DataFrame being generated incorrectly. 

The cause of the bug is that `clocs` is a tuple in Case 3 and Case 2, and is incorrectly processed as if it were a list. As a result, the index level numbers generated from the tuple input are not what they should be, and the subsequent code operates inappropriately.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to accept the `clocs` parameter as a list of level identifiers. This can be done by adding a new step to check if `clocs` is a tuple and then converting it to a list of level identifiers using the `._get_level_number()` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    index = data.index
    # remaining code from the original function...
```

This change ensures that `clocs` is processed correctly regardless of whether it is provided as a tuple or a list.

By making this change, the function will now handle the input properly, avoiding the KeyError that was being raised due to the mishandling of the `clocs` parameter.
