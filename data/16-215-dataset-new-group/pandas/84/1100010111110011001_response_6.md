## The issue
The `_get_level_number` method is raising an error, indicating that the value it was searching for was not found in the list. This is causing the `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` error message.

The issue lies in how the `clocs` list is being treated and how the indexing is being done.

## Suggested fix
1. Instead of directly modifying `clocs` in place, create a new list called `clocs_list` and modify it as necessary.
2. Make sure that the index is found in the level number, if not, raise a KeyError instead of a ValueError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (previous code)

    clocs_list = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... (subsequent code)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs_list)):
                val = clocs_list[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs_list = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs_list]

            return result

        # ... (subsequent code)

    # ... (subsequent code)

    return unstacked
```
