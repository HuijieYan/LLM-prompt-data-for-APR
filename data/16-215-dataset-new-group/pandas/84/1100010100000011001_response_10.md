The bug in the function is related to the logic for unstacking the data and creating new indices and columns. It is causing issues when dealing with different levels of MultiIndex and unstacking. 

To fix the bug, the section responsible for unstacking the data and creating new indices and columns needs to be revised. It is important to handle the hierarchical columns properly while creating the new indices and columns.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(index.levels[0])
    else:
        dummy_index = index.droplevel(clocs).unique()

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = dummy_index.levels + clevels
    new_codes = ccodes + [unstacked.index.codes[i] for i in range(len(clocs))]

    new_names = list(index.names) + cnames

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels,
        codes=new_codes,
        names=new_names,
        verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function properly unstacks the data and handles the creation of new indices and columns for both single and multi-level indices. This should fix the issues related to unstacking that were present in the original function.
