The bug arises from the `_get_level_number` method failing to correctly identify the level of the index. The cause of the bug is related to how the `clocs` variable is handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function. When calling `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, this line does not properly handle the `clocs` input in the case that it is a tuple.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle the `clocs` input when it is a tuple and to correctly identify the levels of the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handling hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Convert tuple to list

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if not (isinstance(cloc, int) or isinstance(cloc, str)):
            cloc = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        cloc_numbers.append(cloc)

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

After implementing the corrected function, you should run the failing test cases provided to ensure that the bug is fixed and the tests pass.
