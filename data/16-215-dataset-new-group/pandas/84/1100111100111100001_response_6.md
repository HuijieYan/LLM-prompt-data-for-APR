### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `_get_level_number` function is called to obtain the position of the level in the index. The error messages indicate that the level names are not being found in the list of names or are not being properly handled when they are found. This occurs while processing the `clocs` input, which likely represents the levels to be unstacked. The subsequent code then attempts to split the index into clocs and rlocs based on their position within `index` and works with these sections to perform unstacking operations.

### Bug Location
The issue arises in the following line of code:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line tries to get the level number for each item in `clocs`, but it seems to be getting confused by the input data type, as `clocs` may have a different structure than expected.

### Bug Cause
The function `_get_level_number` is meant to obtain the level number based on the level name from the index. The error arises most likely due to the incorrect input type being passed to `_get_level_number` on the line mentioned above. This leads to the failure in identifying the specified levels within the index.

### Suggested Fix
The input `clocs` is expected to be in a specific format, but in the failing test cases, it seems to have tuples and nested tuples as its elements. A modification is required to handle such input structures correctly. We may need to flatten and preprocess the `clocs` input to ensure it meets the expected format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # ... existing code ...

    # Flatten and preprocess clocs
    flat_clocs = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            flat_clocs.extend(cloc)
        else:
            flat_clocs.append(cloc)

    clocs = flat_clocs

    index = data.index
    # ... rest of the code ...
```
In the corrected code, the `clocs` input is flattened and processed before further usage. This will ensure that the structure of `clocs` is a simple list, as expected by the subsequent code.

After making this change, ensure to re-run the failing test cases to confirm that the correction resolves the bug.
