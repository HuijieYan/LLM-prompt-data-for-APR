The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely due to the computation of `rlocs`, which results in an empty list. This leads to unexpected behavior when processing the input data from the failing test cases and causes the function to return incorrect results. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `rlocs` is computed correctly based on the provided `clocs` and the number of levels in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Compute the complement of clocs to determine rlocs
    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

After making this fix, re-run the failing test cases to ensure that the corrected function passes all the tests. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `_unstack_multiple` function behaves as expected.

Remember to check for any other affected areas in related functions to ensure that the fix does not introduce regressions elsewhere.
