The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be related to the handling of MultiIndex and Hierarchical columns. The function is intended to perform an unstack operation on the input data based on the provided column locations (`clocs`), but it fails to correctly handle the hierarchical columns.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of index levels and the associated codes. The `clocs` parameter is used to obtain the level numbers from the data index, but the subsequent restructuring of the data fails to properly account for hierarchical columns.

The output DataFrame after the unstacking operation is not correctly structured, leading to the wrong mappings of levels and codes. This results in an incorrect representation of the unstacked data, which is reflected in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

It appears that the core bug lies in the logic for handling the restructuring of the data and the creation of new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the restructuring of the unstacked DataFrame correctly accounts for the hierarchical column structure and preserves the integrity of the data.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract index and column information
    index = data.index
    columns = data.columns

    # Extract level numbers from clocs
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Perform unstacking operation
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    # Return the unstacked DataFrame
    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we leverage the existing `unstack` method of a pandas DataFrame to perform the unstacking operation. The corrected function avoids detailed restructuring of the unstacked DataFrame by utilizing the built-in functionality of pandas. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly for hierarchical columns while maintaining the integrity of the data.

The corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the failing test cases.
