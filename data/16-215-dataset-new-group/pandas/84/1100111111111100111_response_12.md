The issue arises from the `clocs` variable, which expects the level names in the form of `(level_name, level_value)`. However, the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function does not handle tuple names correctly, leading to an error. 

To fix the issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly process the tuple names within the `clocs` variable and adjust the code to handle them properly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    levels = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in levels]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in levels]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in levels]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in levels]
    # unchanged code
```
By handling the tuple names and extracting the levels differently, the revised version above has the potential to resolve the issue.
