The error in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the incorrect calculation of "level number". The code is trying to determine the level number for each element in the `clocs` list through the `_get_level_number` method of the index.

The cause of the bug is that the code is expecting the function `_get_level_number` to handle the tuple of names as input, but it treats each tuple separately. This results in the error message `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`, followed by `KeyError: 'Level A not found`.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the `_get_level_number` method to handle the tuple of names properly so that it can identify the level number correctly. We should also consider using the specific level number instead of the tuple of names to avoid this issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(*i) for i in clocs]  # Change the mechanism to support tuple of names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... (rest of the code remains as-is)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we address the issue by passing a tuple of names to the `_get_level_number` method and making corresponding adjustments to the subsequent code. This modification ensures that the function can resolve the correct level number for the given input.

By implementing these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle the tuple of names or single level input, and the failing test cases should pass as expected.

Additionally, please ensure to modify the `_get_level_number` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file to cater to the changes made in the `_unstack_multiple` function to avoid recurrence of the same issue.
