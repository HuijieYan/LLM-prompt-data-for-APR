## Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is supposed to handle unstacking of data with a multiindex. However, there are issues with handling a tuple of names in a multiindex, as demonstrated in the failing test and the GitHub issue. 

The problem is with the following line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
This line is trying to get the level number associated with the names of the multiindex, but it's not handling tuple names correctly.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_unstack_multiple` function is not handling the case where the multiindex has tuple names. The line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is unable to correctly extract the level numbers when the multiindex has tuple names, and this causes a KeyError later in the function.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to correctly handle multiindex with tuple names. This will involve updating how the level numbers are extracted and used to perform unstacking operations.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers from clocs
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    ...
```
In the fix, we check if the current item (i) in clocs is a string, which indicates it is a tuple name. If it is, we call `index._get_level_number(i)`, otherwise, we use i as it is. This way, we handle both single names and tuple names correctly.

This fix should handle the unstacking with multiindex containing tuple names properly, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
