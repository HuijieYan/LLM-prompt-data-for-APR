Looking at the provided failing test cases and analysis, it seems that the `_get_level_number` function is trying to handle the level 'A' in the MultiIndex, but it's failing due to the index names being in the form of a tuple (e.g., ('A', 'a')).

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` function does not handle tuple names correctly, leading to the KeyError when 'A' is not found in the list of level names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names properly and extract the correct level for unstacking.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # handle hierarchical columns
    index = data.index

    def get_level_number(level):
        names = [name if isinstance(name, str) else name[1] for name in index.names]
        count = names.count(level)
        if (count > 1) and not str(level).isnumeric():
            raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
        try:
            if isinstance(level, tuple):
                level = level[1]
            return names.index(level)
        except ValueError:
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

    clocs = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function will remain the same
```

This updated function includes a new `get_level_number` function that handles tuple names correctly and extracts the level number based on the level name provided.

By fixing the `_get_level_number` function to correctly handle tuple names, we can resolve the KeyError issue and unstack the DataFrame successfully with MultiIndex having tuple names.
