The issue arises within the `_unstack_multiple` function due to an error in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The `clocs` variable should be composed of integers indicating each level number, but instead, it contains a tuple and integers, which leads to the error. This bug prevents the `unstack` function from properly unstacking the input pandas DataFrame, causing the subsequent tests to fail.

The suggested strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the `clocs` variable to be a list of integers, which represent the levels to be unstacked. Additionally, conditional logic should be added to handle the case where `clocs` is empty, and the function should return the input data without performing any unstacking.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle the case when clocs is a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this correction, the function checks to see if `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, it converts `clocs` into a list containing the tuple. This ensures that `clocs` is properly handled as a list of integers, which aligns with the intended use of the `_get_level_number` method. Additionally, the check for an empty `clocs` list and the corresponding early return to avoid unstacking when unnecessary has been retained.
