## Analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is meant to unstack a multi-level index. The function takes in the data, the column locations to be unstacked, and a fill value. However, the function has several potential error locations, such as incorrect handling of multi-level columns, incorrect unstacking of the input data, and potential index alignment issues.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from incorrect handling of multi-level columns, incorrect unstacking of the input data, and potential index alignment issues.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Properly handle the hierarchical (multi-level) columns.
2. Ensure that the unstacking process is done correctly to avoid data misalignment.
3. Validate the index alignment throughout the unstacking process to prevent potential issues.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Unstack the columns
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we simply use the `unstack` method of the `data` object to unstack the columns based on the specified `clocs`. This simplifies the function and leverages the built-in functionality of the pandas library, avoiding potential issues with manual unstacking and index alignment.
