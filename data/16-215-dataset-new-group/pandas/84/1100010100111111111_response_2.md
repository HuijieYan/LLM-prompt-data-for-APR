The issue seems to be related to the `clocs` variable, which is expected to be a tuple, but the `_get_level_number` function is receiving a string instead, leading to the KeyError. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the `_unstack_multiple` function related to the handling of MultiIndex and Single Index.

To address this bug, the `clocs` variable needs to be processed differently depending on whether it's a single level or a tuple of levels, and the `_get_level_number` function should be called with appropriate input. 
The function should check for a single `clocs` level and directly call `_get_level_number` with it. If `clocs` is a tuple of levels, additional processing is required to handle the unstack behavior correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Find the levels and respective index from which to unstack
    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # If clocs contains multiple levels
        cloc_level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        rloc_level_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_level_numbers]

        # Handling if there is only one column remaining after clocs are removed
        cloc_i = cloc_level_numbers[0]
        result = data
        while len(result.columns) > 1:
            result = result.unstack(clocs[cloc_i], fill_value=fill_value)
            cloc_level_numbers = [v if cloc_i > v else v - 1 for v in cloc_level_numbers]

    else:  # If clocs contains a single level
        cloc_level_number = index._get_level_number(clocs)
        rloc_level_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i != cloc_level_number]
        result = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

In this version, the function first checks if `clocs` is a tuple of levels; if it is, it proceeds with the unstacking operation based on the levels provided. If `clocs` is a single level, it directly unstacks using the level without additional processing.

This approach ensures that the unstacking function is applied correctly based on the number and types of levels provided in `clocs` and should address the issues reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
