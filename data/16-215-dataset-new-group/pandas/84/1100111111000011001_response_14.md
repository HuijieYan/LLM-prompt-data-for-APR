The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails to produce the expected output for the given test cases. The function is meant to unstack a DataFrame with either a single column or multiple columns, but the unstacking procedure is not correctly implemented.

The potential error locations within the function include:
1. Incorrectly determining `rlocs` as an empty list when in fact, it should include the non-selected grouping levels.
2. Improper handling of indexing and unstacking operations based on the type of `data` (DataFrame or Series).
3. Inconsistent operations on `unstacked` based on its type, leading to incorrect restructuring of the dataframe.

The cause of the bug appears to be the mishandling of column indexing and unstacking operations based on the data type (Series or DataFrame) and the restructuring of the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be corrected to properly handle the unstacking operation according to the hierarchical levels present in the input data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    new_levels = rlevels + [obs_ids]
    new_codes = rcodes + [comp_ids]

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"], verify_integrity=False
    )

    return data.reindex(columns=new_columns)
```

In the corrected version, the unstacking operation is simplified by directly reindexing the DataFrame with the new column MultiIndex, avoiding unnecessary copying, explicit unstacking procedures, and type checking that caused the incorrect restructuring of the DataFrame. This should ensure that the function now produces the expected output for the provided test cases.
