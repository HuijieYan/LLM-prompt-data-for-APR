The issue with the given function `_unstack_multiple` is that it fails to correctly unstack multi-level index DataFrames, producing unexpected output. This is caused by the way the function handles the movement of the multi-level index levels and the creation of new columns and indices.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. The function should correctly identify and manipulate the multi-level index columns and indices.
2. It should correctly create new columns and indices based on the unstacked data.
3. Make sure to appropriately handle the unstacking of both single-level and multi-level columns.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Ensure clocs is a list
    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    unstacked_data = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    return unstacked_data
```

The corrected function relies heavily on the unstack method available for pandas DataFrames, which is designed to handle the unstacking of multi-level indices correctly. This avoids the need for manual manipulation of indices and columns, reducing the potential for errors.

This corrected function should handle both single-level and multi-level columns and correctly unstack the multi-level indices.
