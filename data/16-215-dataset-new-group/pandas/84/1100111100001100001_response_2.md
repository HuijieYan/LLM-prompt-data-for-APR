Looking at the buggy function and the runtime input/output variable values, the bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the input parameters and the subsequent operations on the data.

In all the cases, the `clocs` parameter is being converted to a list with only the first item in the tuple, which is not the correct approach. The bug causes the function to drop one level of the multi-index and create a multi-index with fewer levels than the original data had, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `clocs` parameter needs to be handled properly, and the subsequent operations should be based on the actual levels of the multi-index as specified in the `clocs` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handling the clocs parameter properly
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)
    cloc_numbers = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rcodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in rloc_numbers]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the `clocs` parameter is appropriately handled, and the function correctly uses the levels and codes of the multi-index as specified by the `clocs` parameter to perform the unstacking operation. This should resolve the bug by ensuring that the multi-index is correctly unstacked as per the specified levels.
