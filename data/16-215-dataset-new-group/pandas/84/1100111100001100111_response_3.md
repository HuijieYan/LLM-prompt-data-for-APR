In the provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the 'clocs' variable is the level(s) to unstack by. The cause of the bug is that the ordering of columns is not handled correctly when unstacking multiple levels. This can result in wrong output especially when dealing with MultiIndex columns. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to occur when unstacking multiple levels of a MultiIndex. 

To fix this bug, the approach will be to make sure the reordering of columns is handled correctly when unstacking multiple levels, and for each iteration, the level indexes `clocs` should be adjusted accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(data, DataFrame):
        raise ValueError("Input data should be a DataFrame")

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if len(clocs) > 1:
        # Recursively unstack single levels
        result = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
        return _unstack_multiple(result, clocs[1:], fill_value=fill_value)

    # Single level unstacking
    level_to_unstack = clocs[0]
    unstacked = data.unstack(level_to_unstack, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected function, I've added a check to ensure that the input data is a DataFrame. The main improvement here is to handle the unstacking of multiple levels recursively. By doing so, the function can correctly handle the reordering of columns for each level while unstacking.

Once this corrected function is implemented, the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the unstacking for multiple levels of a MultiIndex should work correctly.
