The error occurs due to an attempt to unstack by the name 'A' when the correct input should be the level number. This bug is caused by the inconsistency in _unstack_multiple about the nature of the input indices. It expects the indices to be level numbers, but the function provides the index names in some instances. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input to `_unstack_multiple` should be consistent and is provided either as level numbers or index names. Then, modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle both cases correctly.

One approach to resolve this inconsistency issue is to determine whether each index in the `clocs` list is a level number or an index name. Then, process them accordingly in the `_unstack_multiple` function to ensure a consistent handling of the input indices.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if all(isinstance(i, int) for i in clocs):  # Check if all clocs are integers (level numbers)
        pass  # No processing needed
    else:  # If any cloc is an index name, convert it to level numbers
        clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By adding this check and conversion logic, the `_unstack_multiple` function now handles both level numbers and index names consistently. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the correct input format is used when invoking `_unstack_multiple`.
