Based on the analysis of the test cases and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The issue arises due to the incorrect method of obtaining the level numbers from multi-level index. The method `_get_level_number` encounters a value error or raises a key error for multi-level index.

To fix this bug, the `clocs` should be processed as a multi-level index. We can use the `get_loc` method of the index to resolve the specified levels. Then, the obtained level numbers can be used to continue with further computations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.get_loc(i) for i in clocs]  # Get the level numbers using get_loc function

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # ... the rest of the original function's logic.
```

This modification addresses the issue by correctly obtaining the level numbers for multi-level index. This corrected version should resolve the failing test cases and the issue reported in GitHub.
