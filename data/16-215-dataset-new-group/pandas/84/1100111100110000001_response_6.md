The buggy function is `_unstack_multiple` and it is used to handle the unstacking of hierarchical columns. The function tries to rearrange the data based on the hierarchical columns, and is called by the `unstack` method for Series and DataFrame objects. 

The error messages indicate that the issue is related to the method `_get_level_number()` which is called on the `index` object. The error is related to KeyError and ValueError, indicating that the level specified is not found in the index.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to retrieve the level number of a name directly, instead of iterating through the MultiIndex levels to find the correct level name. This causes the KeyError or ValueError when the level is not found.

To fix the bug, we should modify the way the level number is retrieved by iterating through the levels and finding the appropriate level name. Additionally, handling of the KeyError and ValueError exceptions should be improved.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    c_levels = [idx for idx, name in enumerate(index.names) if name in clocs]
    r_levels = [idx for idx, name in enumerate(index.names) if name not in clocs]

    if r_levels == []:
        dummy_index = Index(np.arange(len(data)), name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        r_indices = index.droplevel(clocs)
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([r_indices] * 2, names=["__placeholder__"] * 2)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = c_levels
        new_names = clocs
        new_codes = unstacked.columns.remove_unused_levels().codes
    else:
        # Process for DataFrame when clocs are MultiIndex
        result = data
        for level in clocs:
            result = result.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
        return result

    new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=c_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)

    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we have used list comprehension to iterate through the levels and find the appropriate level names. We also made the necessary updates for DataFrame processing and column handling.
