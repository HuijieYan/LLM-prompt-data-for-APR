The issue is that the _get_level_number and index.names.index logic is not correctly handling the tuple names. 

The `clocs` parameter is a tuple that is applied directly to the `index._get_level_number(i)` call, which expects a string as input. This is causing the function to raise a `ValueError` when trying to find the index for the tuple name.

To fix this issue, the 'clocs' parameter should be handled differently when it contains a tuple. The names in the 'clocs' tuple should be stitched together to form a single level name, and this should be used in the subsequent logic.

Below is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the names from clocs and stitch them together to form a level name
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        level_name = '_'.join(clocs)
    else:
        level_name = clocs

    index = data.index

    level_number = index._get_level_number(level_name)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i != level_number]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
}
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function will correctly handle the tuple names in the MultiIndex and avoid the KeyError that was occurring. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread while preserving the original function's behavior for non-tuple inputs.
