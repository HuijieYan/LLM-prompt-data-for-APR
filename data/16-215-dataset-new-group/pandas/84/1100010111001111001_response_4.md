The buggy function has some issues when handling multi-index data. It seems to incorrectly handle the reconstruction of the MultiIndex after unstacking, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function handles the reconstruction of the MultiIndex after unstacking. Specifically, we need to ensure that the new index and columns have the correct levels, codes, and names.

Here's the corrected version of the _unstack_multiple function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]

    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        dummy = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(dummy.index, names=rlevels)
        dummy.columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples(dummy.columns, names=clevels)

    return dummy
```

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
