The issue when calling the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` comes from the processing of multi-index levels and the corresponding codes. This leads to errors when the function tries to create a `MultiIndex` with new levels and codes, eventually causing the failing test cases.

The error messages indicate that the issue is due to the buggy function's handling of multi-index levels, which results in the incorrect creation of a `MultiIndex` when performing an unstack operation on the DataFrame.

To address this bug, you should modify the section of the code where the new indices and columns are being created based on the existing indices and columns. This involves refactoring the steps for creating new levels, names, and codes to ensure they are constructed correctly when using tuples. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis provided:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)
  
    dummy = data.copy()
    
    new_levels = rlevels + [index.levels[clocs[0]]]
    new_codes = rcodes + [obs_ids]
    new_names = rnames + [index.names[clocs[0]]]
    
    dummy.index = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels,
        codes=new_codes,
        names=new_names,
        verify_integrity=False,
    )
    
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

You would now need to test this corrected version against the failing test cases to ensure it resolves the issues.
