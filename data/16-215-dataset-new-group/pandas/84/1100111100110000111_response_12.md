The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` function does not handle the tuple of tuple names correctly for the MultiIndex.

The function `_get_level_number` tries to get the index of the level, but when `level` is a tuple of tuple names, it fails, as it expects a string. This is reflected in the error message: `KeyError: 'Level A not found'`.

One way to fix this is to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle the tuple of tuple names. It should be able to receive a tuple of tuple names and deal with each sub-level tuple name separately to find the index.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses this issue:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Modify the condition for tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        # For non-tuple clocs
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```
By adding a check for `isinstance(clocs, tuple)` and handling tuple names correctly, the bug related to handling the tuple of tuple names should be resolved.

This change should fix the issue experienced in cases where the `unstack` function is called with tuple names in the MultiIndex with the MultiIndexed Column DataFrame.
