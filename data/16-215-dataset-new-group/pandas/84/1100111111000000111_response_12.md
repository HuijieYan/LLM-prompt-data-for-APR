## Issue Analysis
The issue is associated with the function `_unstack_multiple` in the codebase. The failing tests indicate that when attempting to unstack a MultiIndex with a tuple name, the function raises a `KeyError`. The code provided in the GitHub issue gives a trace having multiple function calls, ultimately leading to the reported error.

## Potential Error Locations
The error is directly linked to the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line specifically within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

## Cause of the Bug
Based on the provided GitHub issue and failing test, it seems that when processing tuple names in the MultiIndex, the `_unstack_multiple` function does not correctly recognize `A` and `B` from the input tuple name `("A", "a")`. This causes the subsequent error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix could involve checking the type of `i` when iterating through `clocs`, and if `i` is a tuple, then attempting to extract and handle the multiple level names. This would involve modifying the logic to handle tuple names correctly.

## Corrected Version
Based on this analysis, a modified version of the `_unstack_multiple` function could be as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, int) else index._get_loc(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... remaining logic remains unchanged
```
This modified implementation includes a conditional check for the type of `i`. If `i` is an integer, it proceeds to the standard level number retrieval, if it's not, it uses `index._get_loc(i)` to handle the tuple name correctly.

This corrected version should address the reported bug and allow the `_unstack_multiple` function to work as expected, passing the failing tests and resolving the GitHub issue.
