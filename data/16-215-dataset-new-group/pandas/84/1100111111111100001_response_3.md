The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number()` method returns an error when the level is a tuple, causing the `clocs` variable to be incorrectly set to `[0]` instead of the appropriate level number. This results in the various indexing and unstacking operations being performed incorrectly. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_level_number()` method to correctly handle tuple-level input.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc_str = cloc[1]
        else:
            cloc_str = cloc
        cloc_number = index._get_level_number(cloc_str)
        cloc_numbers.append(cloc_number)

    clocs = cloc_numbers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the `clocs` variable will be correctly populated with level numbers, and the subsequent operations will be performed correctly, fixing the bug.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
