The cause of the issue is that the `_unstack_multiple` function doesn't handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly, which leads to a KeyError. Specifically, within the `_unstack_multiple` function, the `index._get_level_number(i)` call is causing the KeyError. This call is attempting to get the level number of a specific index from the MultiIndex, and if the index doesn't exist (as is the case with tuple names), it raises a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly. This involves changing how it extracts information about the index, how it interacts with the levels, names, and codes of the index, and how it processes the unstacked result.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

The key change in this corrected version is the addition of a check inside the `clocs` list comprehension to handle the case where a level is specified by a tuple name. By using `isinstance(i, (str, tuple))`, we can determine whether an element in `clocs` is a string or a tuple, and we retrieve the level number using the appropriate method (or directly use it if it's not a tuple). This change allows the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names without raising a KeyError.
