Looking at the error messages, it seems the issue is occurring in the `_get_level_number()` function of the `MultiIndex` class. The error message is indicating that it's trying to find the level 'A' in the list of names, but it's not finding it, resulting in either a ValueError or KeyError.

The `_unstack_multiple()` function is attempting to convert the passed levels `clocs` into level numbers using the `_get_level_number()` method. The issue occurs because the levels are being passed as tuples of strings rather than single strings or integers, which causes the method to throw errors when trying to find the levels by name or index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the levels being passed to `_get_level_number()` are single values rather than tuples of strings. We also need to handle both single-level and multi-level (MultiIndex) columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        cnames = [c[1] if isinstance(c, tuple) else c for c in clocs]
    else:
        cnames = [c if isinstance(c, str) else index.levels[c] for c in clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(c) if isinstance(c, str) else c for c in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return unstacked
``` 

In this corrected version, we first check if the index is a MultiIndex and extract the single values for the level names if it is. Then, for both single-level and MultiIndex columns, we handle the levels appropriately to ensure they can be used as indices to find the level numbers without raising any errors.
