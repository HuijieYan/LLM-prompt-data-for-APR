The error messages provide a clear indication of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error is related to the handling of MultiIndex objects. The bug is caused by the method `_get_level_number` of MultiIndex that is not handling tuple names correctly.

The cause of the bug involves the `clocs` input variable in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It attempts to convert `clocs` to the level number by calling `index._get_level_number(i)`, and this is where the error occurs.

To fix the bug, we need to address the way the `clocs` input variable is handled and converted to level numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy = data.copy()

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    
    new_levels = clevels
    new_codes = recons_codes
    new_names = index.names
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
In this corrected version, the handling of `clocs` has been changed to avoid indexing issues and to correctly perform the unstack operation, addressing the root cause of the bug. We also removed the conversion of `clocs` to level numbers because it can cause issues in multi-index scenarios.

Please test this corrected version of the function to ensure that it passes the failing test and resolves the GitHub issue.
