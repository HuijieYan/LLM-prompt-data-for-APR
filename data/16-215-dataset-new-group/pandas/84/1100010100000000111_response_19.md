The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is referenced in the GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The problem seems to occur when attempting to unstack a multi-indexed dataframe using tuple names, e.g. `s.unstack(("A", "a"))`.

Looking at the function, the potential error locations include the following:
1. The method `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` where `clocs` is a list of column locations.
2. The construction of a dummy index and the subsequent unstacking based on this index.

The cause of the error is that the function does not handle hierarchical columns properly, which leads to issues when attempting to unstack a multi-indexed dataframe with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to handle hierarchical columns correctly. This correction involves ensuring that column levels and codes are handled properly, and that the unstacked result is using the correct columns and names.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, tuple)) else i for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = data.index.to_flat_index()

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value, verify_integrity=False)

    return unstacked
```
In this corrected version:
1. The method `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is modified to handle string and tuple inputs. If the input is a string or tuple, it converts to level number else uses the given level number directly.
2. The check for `isinstance(data, Series)` is performed to decide whether to use a flat index.
3. Dummy index and unstacking are performed accordingly.

By ensuring that the hierarchical columns are handled correctly and using the appropriate methods for unstacking, this corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
