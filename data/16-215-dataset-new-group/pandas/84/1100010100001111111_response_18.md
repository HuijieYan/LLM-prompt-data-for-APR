The bug occurs when the function `_unstack_multiple` tries to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex level name provided as a tuple, causing a KeyError. The issue reported on GitHub provides a failing test case where `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` raises a ValueError due to invalid indexing.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` attempts to handle hierarchical columns but fails due to problematic indexing and unstacking operations. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the input parameter `clocs` and perform the unstacking operations on the given DataFrame with a MultiIndex.

The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = clocs[0]

    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    if len(level_numbers) == 1:
        return data.unstack(level_numbers[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        return data.unstack(level_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)
```

In the updated function, a check is added to handle the case where `clocs` is provided as a tuple. Then, the level numbers are obtained using `_get_level_number`. If there is only one level number, the DataFrame is unstacked using that single level number. For multiple level numbers, the DataFrame is unstacked with a list of level numbers.

With this fix, the function should handle unstacking correctly for provided MultiIndex level names, thereby resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
