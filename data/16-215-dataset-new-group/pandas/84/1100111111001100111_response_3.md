The issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function you provided is that it is not properly handling MultiIndexes, which is leading to errors. This can be seen from the failing tests provided, as well as from the input/output variable values you've listed.

The issue is caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function attempting to handle MultiIndexed data and unstack it based on tuple names, but it fails to do so and produces a KeyError. This is related to the index handling and parsing of level names, and it's leading to incorrect reshaping of the data, as observed from the `unstack` failures. 

To fix the bug, you can make changes in the `_unstack_multiple` function to ensure that it properly handles MultiIndexes and the parsing of level names.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = pd.Index(index).get_level_number(clocs)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            # Handling for MultiIndex
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The correction involves using the `pd.Index(index)` call to properly handle MultiIndexed data and get the level numbers. Also, the handling for MultiIndex data within the function has been adjusted to account for multiple levels and to properly unstack the data.

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to handle MultiIndexed data and unstack it based on tuple names, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
