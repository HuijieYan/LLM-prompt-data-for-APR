Looking at the buggy function and its relationship with the runtime input/output values, it seems that the function is intended to unstack a multi-indexed DataFrame based on the specified column levels. However, there are several issues with the code.

The main cause of the bug is that the resulting MultiIndex levels, codes, and columns are being incorrectly constructed in several parts of the function, leading to misalignment of the unstacked data.

To fix the bug, we can start by creating a consistent set of levels, codes, and columns before assigning them to the unstacked DataFrame. 

Here's a corrected version of the function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, [len(l) for l in clevels], sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, [len(l) for l in clevels], ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = rlevels + clevels
        new_names = rnames + cnames
        new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version uses a consistent approach to construct the levels, codes, and columns, and assigns them to the unstacked DataFrame based on the input data.

This fix should address the issues observed in the buggy function and produce the expected unstacked output for the given input cases.
