The issue appears to stem from the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas/pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file. The function currently tries to handle multiple levels of unstacking, but it encounters issues, especially with MultiIndex data, leading to out-of-place and inaccurate results. 

Based on the failing test cases ("test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex" and "test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex") and their expected input/output values, it seems that the function is unable to handle unstacking correctly with MultiIndex data that includes tuple names. This results in a `KeyError`, as detailed in the GitHub issue report.

To fix the issue:
- Adjust the code within the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle unstacking with MultiIndex data, including tuple names.
- Ensure that the function accurately resolves the levels and correctly fills the values when unstacking, as per the expected input/output values from the failing tests.

Given the description of the bug and the input/output values provided, a corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple` could be as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    comp_ids = data.index.get_level_values(clocs).values
    obs_ids, codes = pd.factorize(comp_ids)

    result = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    if len(codes) > 1 and isinstance(result.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        new_columns = result.columns.set_levels(codes, level=result.columns.names.index(clocs))
        result.columns = new_columns

    return result
```

This resolved version of the function should be able to handle unstacking effectively with MultiIndex data containing tuple names, avoiding the KeyError issue while producing the expected results.
