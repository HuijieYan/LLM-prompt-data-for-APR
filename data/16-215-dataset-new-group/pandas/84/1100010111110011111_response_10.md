The cause of the bug is due to incorrect handling of a MultiIndex by the `_unstack_multiple` function, leading to unexpected errors. The `_unstack_multiple` function extracts index information such as the levels, codes, and names before performing unstacking operations on the data. However, when trying to select the level number with `index._get_level_number(i)` for each level in `clocs`, there is a mistake.

The problematic area in the code is here:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

This line of code is causing errors because it is extracting the level number from a level tuple instead of handling it as part of a MultiIndex as expected.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the function properly handles MultiIndexes and performs unstacking operations without causing attribute and index errors.
2. Add a conditional block to handle the case for MultiIndex columns when an instance is passed. The existing code improperly assumes a single level and causes the failure.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the level numbers only if data.columns is not a MultiIndex
    if not isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
```

With this corrected version, we ensure that the level number of the MultiIndex is only extracted when the input data's columns are not of MultiIndex type. This ensures that the `_get_level_number` method is only called when appropriate and avoids the KeyError and ValueError exceptions.

Upon running the failing test functions, the corrected function should now pass, providing the expected output.
