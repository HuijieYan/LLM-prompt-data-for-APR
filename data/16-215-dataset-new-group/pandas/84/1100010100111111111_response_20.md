The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect processing of the `clocs`, which is a tuple, in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The `clocs` parameter represents the position of the levels to unstack along the columns. However, the function seems to be incorrectly processing this tuple in various parts of the code, resulting in the erroneous unstacking.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` tuple is properly handled and converted into a list of level positions, and then used correctly throughout the function. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Remaining implementation (parts not related to handling clocs)...
```

In this corrected version, we check if `clocs` is a tuple, and if it is, we convert it into a list of level positions using the `index._get_level_number` method. This ensures that the input is correctly handled, and removes the source of the Key/Value error.
