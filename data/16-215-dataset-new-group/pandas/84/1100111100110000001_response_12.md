### Bug location
The source of the bug seems to be in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where it tries to convert the column locations to level numbers.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by a mismatch in the way the levels are specified and converted. The `Index` or `MultiIndex` objects are used to represent hierarchical columns in pandas, and when calling the `_get_level_number` function, the current approach doesn't handle multiple level names properly, leading to a `ValueError` or `KeyError`.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle hierarchical columns correctly and convert the level names to level numbers. This might involve verifying the structure of the level names and handling them accordingly.

### The corrected function
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]  # Updated line

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The updated line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]` correctly handles the case when `clocs` contains tuples representing multi-level names.

This update ensures that MultiIndex objects with multi-level column names will be handled correctly, fixing the ValueError or KeyError that was previously being raised.
