Based on the provided information, here is the analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, the runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue:

The `_unstack_multiple` function is designed to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on multiple levels. It is part of the file `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`.

1. The failing test cases cover multiple scenarios involving multi-index data frames and series. The failing tests show that the current implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function is not correctly handling the unstacking of multi-index levels.

2. Multiple sections of the function could potentially contain the error. The usage of indexing, codes, levels, and names needs to be carefully reviewed to identify the issues.

3. The provided runtime values and types of variables inside the `_unstack_multiple` function reveal that the computation of new_levels, new_names, and new_codes may not be handling multi-index levels properly. It's likely that the incorrect handling of multi-index levels is causing issues in reconstructing the correct data frame or series after unstacking.

4. To fix the bug, it's essential to address how the function handles multi-index levels. This might involve modifying the code that computes the new levels, names, and codes for unstacking.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should address the bug and pass the failing test cases:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    
    if rlocs:
        new_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False
        )
    else:
        new_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")

    unstacked = data.copy()
    unstacked.index = new_index

    if fill_value is not None:
        unstacked = unstacked.fillna(fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```

This modified function should now correctly handle multi-index levels and address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
