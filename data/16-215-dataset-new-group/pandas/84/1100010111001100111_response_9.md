Based on the failing test cases and the Github issue, it seems that the `_unstack_multiple` function is failing to correctly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names, which leads to the KeyError during the unstack operation.

Looking at the runtime values, it's apparent that the function does not correctly handle the clocs (column locations) when they are tuples. The implementation of `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` assumes a single level, and there are issues with handling clocs and rlocs, which results in the KeyError in some cases.

To fix this, we need to handle the case when clocs are tuples differently than when it's a single level. We also need to re-evaluate the logic around clocs, rlocs, clevels, ccodes, and other related variables, ensuring that the logic for MultiIndexes with tuple names is correctly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # TODO: Handle hierarchical columns
        
    index = data.index
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected version includes proper handling for clocs when it's a tuple and when it's a single level. It also maintains the rest of the existing logic for clocs, rlocs, clevels, ccodes, and other related variables.

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to correctly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names and pass the failing tests, resolving the issue in the GitHub report.
