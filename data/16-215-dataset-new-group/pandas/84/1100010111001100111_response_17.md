The `pandas.core.reshap.reshap.py` file contains a buggy function `_unstack_multiple` that is causing tests to fail.

Upon analysis, it appears that the issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function's inability to handle the hierarchical columns of a DataFrame, leading to a `KeyError` when unstacking.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling hierarchical columns correctly, leading to an error when attempting to access the level number for a specific column label in the DataFrame's index. This error leads to the subsequent failure when attempting to perform the unstack operation.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be updated to properly handle the case of hierarchical columns in the input DataFrame during the unstack operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By updating the function to directly use the `unstack` method available for both Series and DataFrame objects, the issue with handling hierarchical columns is resolved. This should address the unstacking problem and resolve the failing tests.
