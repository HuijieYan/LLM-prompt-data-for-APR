The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` throws a `KeyError` when the `data` parameter has multiple levels and the `clocs` parameter is a tuple, causing the `index._get_level_number` function to fail.

After analyzing the runtime and expected values, it's evident that the main cause of the bug is the usage of the `index._get_level_number` function, as it's causing the incorrect mapping of the column level names to their numerical indices. This leads to incorrect transformations and ultimately raises the `KeyError` in the return statement.

To fix this bug, we need to reconsider how the `clocs` parameter is used and determine the correct way to obtain the level numbers for the input levels when dealing with a MultiIndex. Next, we need to ensure that these level numbers are correctly used to extract the necessary information from the input `data` with MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Retrieve the level numbers from the input MultiIndex
    levels = data.index.names
    level_numbers = [levels.index(level) for level in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(level_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this correction, we skip the advanced manipulation of the MultiIndex levels and instead use the `unstack` method directly on the input `data`. The `level_numbers` list provides the level names represented as integers, avoiding the need for complicated manipulation of MultiIndex attributes.

With these changes, the corrected function should no longer throw a `KeyError` when handling MultiIndexed data with tuple names.
