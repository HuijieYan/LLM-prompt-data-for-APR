The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing it to fail the test cases. The function tries to unstack a DataFrame at multiple levels, but the approach used is leading to errors.

The cause of the bug lies in the handling of MultiIndex columns and the creation of new levels, names, and codes. The logic used to prepare new levels, names, and codes is not handling the hierarchical nature of the columns correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the approach to handling MultiIndex columns and the creation of new levels, names, and codes must be revised. The code needs to correctly handle the hierarchical nature of the columns. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

This revised version first checks for an empty `clocs` list, and if it's not empty, it directly unstacks the DataFrame at the specified levels. This ensures that the correct unstacking operation is performed directly without the need for manipulating index levels, names, or codes.

By implementing this revised logic, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle the unstacking operation for MultiIndex columns, resolving the bug and allowing it to pass the failing tests.
