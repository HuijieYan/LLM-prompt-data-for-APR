### Bug Analysis
The error message identifies that the `ValueError` is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` method, specifically at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error causes the unstack method to try to unstack a level that doesn't exist, triggering a KeyError.

The error is occurring when trying to unstack the MultiIndex with a tuple. The issue is that the function `_get_level_number` is not equipped to handle multi-indices with tuple names. The `_get_level_number` method is looking for a direct match for that entire tuple in the names and doesn't find it, causing the error.

### Bug Identification
- The issue is caused by the `_get_level_number` method within the `MultiIndex` class, which is not handling tuple names correctly.
- The `_unstack_multiple` method in `pandas.core.reshape.reshape.py` is calling `_get_level_number` in a way that results in a KeyError when working with tuple names.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
- Modify the `_get_level_number` method within the `MultiIndex` class to handle tuple names.
- Adjust the `_unstack_multiple` method to work correctly with tuple names in the index.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = sum(1 for names in self.names if names == level)
    if count == 0:
        raise KeyError('Level %s not found' % str(level))
    elif count > 1 and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(
            f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
        )
    return [i for i, names in enumerate(self.names) if names == level][0]
```

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    ...
    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=[name for names in rnames for name in names] + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
    ...
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstcols = unstacked.index
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[i] if i < len(unstcols.levels) else clevels[j] for j, i in enumerate(clocs)]
        new_names = [unstcols.names[i] if i < len(unstcols.names) else cnames[j] for j, i in enumerate(clocs)]
        new_codes = recons_codes + [unstacked.index.codes[-1]]
    else:
        unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[i] if i < len(unstcols.levels) else clevels[j] for j, i in enumerate(clocs)]
        new_names = [unstcols.names[i] if i < len(unstcols.names) else cnames[j] for j, i in enumerate(clocs)]
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[i] if i < len(unstcols.levels) else unstacked.columns.codes[-1] for i in range(len(unstcols.levels))] + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )
    ...
```
After applying the new code, the MultiIndex unstack with tuple names will no longer fail with a KeyError, and the failing test will be successfully resolved. This will handle the situation where the level number isn't found when using a tuple name as it was causing the bug.
