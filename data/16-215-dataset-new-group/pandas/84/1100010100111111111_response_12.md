The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function stems from the mapping of levels to their corresponding positions and an inconsistency related to the converting of tuple names to integers. This results in the KeyError issue when attempting to unstack a multi-index using a tuple name.

The cause of the bug is as follows:
1. The `clocs` list is not correctly transformed from its tuple input, leading to incorrect integer conversions in the subsequent steps.
2. As a result, the `_get_level_number` function fails to find the Level (the corresponding tuple name) and raises a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to handle tuple names correctly, and the `clocs` conversion from tuple to list needs to be fixed.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the actual levels from clocs
    if not isinstance(clocs[0], int):  # Check if the tuple name is given
        clocs = [data.index.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]  # Convert tuple names to integer positions

    # ...rest of the unstacking logic remains unchanged
```

With this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function will correctly convert tuple names to integer positions when needed, ensuring that the unstacking operation proceeds without errors.
