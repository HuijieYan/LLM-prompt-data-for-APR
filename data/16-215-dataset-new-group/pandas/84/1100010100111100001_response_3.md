The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function occurs due to a mismatch between the column locations (clocs) and the index levels within the "data" object. This occurs during the process of shifting levels and unstacking the DataFrame when multiple columns are being unstacked.

The problematic line is:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

The issue arises from the fact that for multi-index data, the "clocs" should be expressed as the actual index level names or positional index levels. The function should handle both cases appropriately, which it currently fails to do. This is evident from the error messages that indicate the "clocs" are being represented as tuples, whereas the function processes them as a list of integer positional levels.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` function should be updated to handle the different forms of "clocs" appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function
```

In the corrected version, if "clocs" is a tuple, it automatically converts it to a list. Then, when processing "clocs," the function checks if each element is a string (representing index level names) and converts it to the corresponding level number using `_get_level_number`. If the element is already an integer, it is kept as is. This ensures that the function can handle both forms of "clocs" appropriately.

By making this change, the function should now process the "clocs" correctly, fixing the bug and allowing it to pass the failing tests.
