The main problem with the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the indexing and reorganizing of the levels in the input data. The error in the GitHub issue reflects a problem that occurs when trying to unstack the data due to the incorrect manipulation of the index levels in the function.

The actual cause of the bug stems from inappropriate processing of the index, confusion in handling the levels, codes, names, and other properties of MultiIndex. The function attempts to handle different types of data (Series and DataFrame) separately and performs different unstacking operations, but the logic is flawed, which results in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to check the type of the input `data` and modify the logic of unstacking. We should also ensure that the manipulation and transformation of the index is performed correctly and consistently for both Series and DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs)
    else:  # DataFrame
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product(clevels, names=[index.names[i] for i in clocs])
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = rlevels[0]
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version simplifies the unstacking procedure and ensures consistent handling of Series and DataFrames. It directly uses the `unstack` method of the Series or DataFrame and then organizes the columns or index as needed. This correction should now yield the expected results and resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
