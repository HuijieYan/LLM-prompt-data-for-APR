The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the `clocs` variable being incorrectly processed when it is a tuple. This causes an error when the function attempts to convert the tuple elements into level numbers using the `index._get_level_number()` method.

The `clocs` variable should be handled as a tuple with named levels and integers as well. In this context, when the variable `clocs` is a tuple, the function fails to handle it properly, leading to incorrect processing.

The `unstack` operation on a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, specifically when using `tuple` as the parameter, results in incorrect functionality due to the mismatch between expected and actual levels.

This bug can be fixed by overhauling the logic for handling `clocs`. Instead of directly getting the level number of `clocs`, the code should identify the levels and then proceed accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ...

    # Replace the expression for handling clocs with the following code
    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # ...
    
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # ...
```

In the new version, the `clocs` variable is processed to identify level numbers, taking care to handle tuples with a mixture of named levels and integer values correctly.

This revised function modifies how the level numbers are extracted from the input while preserving their original form. It identifies the levels and then proceeds accordingly for reliable unstacking of the provided data.

The revisions ensure that the function works correctly when the `clocs` variable contains a mixture of named levels and integers, preventing the previous failures when dealing with a MultiIndex DataFrame with named tuple levels.

By replacing the problematic expression with the new code, the function will correctly handle the `clocs` variable and avoid triggering errors when it is a mixture of named levels and integers.
