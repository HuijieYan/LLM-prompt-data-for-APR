The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be related to the logic for unstacking data with hierarchical columns. The function is intended to unstack the data following a specific set of rules, but the current implementation has some issues around variable assignment and unstacking logic.

The function expects the input parameters `clocs` and `data` to be passed in. It also uses attributes of the `data.index` and `data.columns` which include `index._get_level_number(i)`, `index.levels`, `index.codes`, `index.names`, `index.nlevels`, and methods like `dummy.unstack`, `result.unstack`, etc. These values, type, and relationship to the input parameters need to be carefully managed so that they are correctly reshaped and unstacked as intended.

The `clocs` variable appears to be used to identify the columns to be unstacked. The index's level numbers are parsed and the original and reshaped columns' levels and codes are extracted, replaced, and modified accordingly to be correctly unstacked. Furthermore, a placeholder `MultiIndex` is created to be used for unstacking and the resulting DataFrame or Series is then reindexed to adopt the new unstacked shape.

To fix the bug, a more systematic approach should be taken to ensure that the reshaping and unstacking process is handled correctly. This could involve debugging and refactoring the logic to ensure that the variables are being manipulated and reassigned correctly, and that the unstacked output is consistent with the expected result.

Below is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the assignments and unstacking logic have been carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the reshaping is carried out correctly. This version should now satisfy the expected input and output values provided in the failing test case.
