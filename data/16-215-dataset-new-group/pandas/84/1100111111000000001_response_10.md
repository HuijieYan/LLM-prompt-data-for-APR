## Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function is trying to handle the multi-index unstack operation, but the logic is complex and prone to errors. There are multiple code paths for handling `data` as a Series or a DataFrame, as well as different cases for dealing with `ccodes` and `obs_ids`. The logic is difficult to follow and could be causing the buggy behavior.

The failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` are related to the unstacking of a DataFrame with a multi-index. Both tests have multiple levels of multi-index and test the unstacking operation with different keys.

## Bug
The `_unstack_multiple` function fails to handle the unstacking of DataFrames with multi-index properly, as evident from the failing test cases. The function produces incorrect results for multi-index unstacking operations.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we have to simplify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function and ensure that it correctly handles the unstacking of DataFrames with multi-index.

## Bug-fixed version of the function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Index of the DataFrame
    index = data.index

    # Selection of columns to unstack
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        # Single level in index. For unstacking, use normal column index
        df = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Multi-level index
        level_to_unstack = index._get_level_number(clocs)
        other_levels = list(set(range(index.nlevels)) - set(level_to_unstack))
        name_level = [index.names[i] for i in level_to_unstack]
        data = data.unstack(level_to_unstack, fill_value=fill_value)

        # Create new MultiIndex for the unstacked DataFrame
        new_index = data.index.reorder_levels(other_levels + name_level)
        data.index = new_index

        df = data

    return df
```
