## Description of the Bug

The issue is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method when trying to find the level number for the tuple name `('A', 'a')`. This is because the `MultiIndex` is expecting a string, not a tuple. The bug stems from the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically when it tries to convert the level names into level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`. 

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle tuple names when unstacking MultiIndexed data. Additionally, a check should be added to ensure that the input level is formatted correctly.

## The Corrected Version

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function implementation...
```

This correction addresses the issue of tuple names by ensuring that level names passed as tuples are correctly handled. A check is added to determine the type of the input level, and if it is a string, the level number is obtained directly. If it is a tuple, the first element of the tuple is used to obtain the level number. This will ensure that the correct level number is retrieved for both string and tuple names, resolving the bug.
