Looking at the provided details, the `_unstack_multiple` function performs the task of unstacking elements from a MultiIndex DataFrame. The function has several error-prone areas, but the key issue arises from the `clocs` parameter.

1. After analyzing Case 1, I observed that the `clocs` input is a tuple, but most of the function logic assumes `clocs` to be a list. This directly impacts the later operations in the function.
   
2. In Case 2 and Case 3, `clocs` is a tuple with multiple items. The function logic isn't designed to handle multiple levels in `clocs`.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the input `clocs` properly. It should be a list of levels or tuples for handling nested levels. Additionally, the function should verify the input `clocs` and its compatibility with the MultiIndex DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly process the `clocs` input and handle nested levels. It should also verify whether `clocs` matches the levels of the MultiIndex DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs tuple to list, handling single or multi-level case
    clocs = [clocs] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else list(clocs)

    index = data.index

    # This part of the function remains unchanged
    ...

    return unstacked  # Return the unstacked data accordingly
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by handling `clocs` as both a list of levels or a tuple of levels.

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle both single and multi-level unstacking operations correctly.
