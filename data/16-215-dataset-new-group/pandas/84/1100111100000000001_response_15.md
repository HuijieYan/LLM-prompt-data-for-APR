## Analysis and Identification of Bugs
1. The function `_unstack_multiple` takes `data`, `clocs`, and `fill_value` as input parameters and is responsible for unstacking multi-level index data in a DataFrame or Series. It uses a series of operations to handle the unstacking process.
2. The bug likely occurs due to incorrect handling of the index, levels, and codes when unstacking the data. Additionally, there are conditional checks for different types of data (DataFrame or Series) and different types of index (SingleIndex or MultiIndex) that may lead to inconsistent behavior.

## Bug Cause
The main cause of the bug seems to be improper handling of the index, levels, and codes when unstacking the data along with conditional checks for different types of data and index.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function:
1. Properly handle the index and levels when unstacking the data.
2. Simplify the conditional checks for different types of data and index to ensure consistent behavior.
3. Utilize the appropriate functions and attributes provided by the pandas library for unstacking operations.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        # Unstacking along the complete column index
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Unstacking with custom columns, handling MultiIndex if needed
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected version, the function directly uses the `unstack` method available for DataFrames and Series, simplifying the unstacking process. It also removes the unnecessary handling of levels, codes, and different data/index types, ensuring consistent behavior and reducing the potential for bugs.
