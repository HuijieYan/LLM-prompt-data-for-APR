The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that the `clocs` argument may contain a level name (e.g., 'A'), instead of the level number, which is expected by the `index._get_level_number(i)` call. This causes a `ValueError` to be raised because 'A' is not a valid index. 

To fix this bug, we need to convert level names to level numbers before using them in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]  # Convert level names to level numbers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function will check if `clocs` contains a level name and convert it to a level number before using it in the `index._get_level_number(i)` call. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly with both level names and level numbers.
