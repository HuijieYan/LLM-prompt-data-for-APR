The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is experiencing an error due to the `_get_level_number` method in the `index` class. The error message indicates that 'A' is not found in the list, which is causing a `ValueError` and a subsequent `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to pass the name 'A' as the level number instead of the actual index level number. This results in the error message 'A is not in the list' and 'Level A not found'.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the correct level number is being passed to the `_get_level_number` method instead of the level name. This can be achieved by modifying the way level numbers are being obtained and used throughout the function.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if index.__class__ is MultiIndex:
        clocs = [i if isinstance(i, int) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged

```
