The issue with the current `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the extraction of level numbers and the subsequent unstacking of the input data structure based on these levels. The level numbers that are extracted are being used incorrectly, leading to the generation of incorrect output.

To address this issue, a corrective approach would involve modifying the code to ensure that the level numbers are used correctly, and that the subsequent unstacking of the data is performed accurately, in line with the specified level names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the input data
    index = data.index

    # Determine the levels to unstack
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    # Unstack the data
    unstacked = data.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the problematic indexing and unstacking processes are simplified and performed in a more direct manner to ensure that the output accurately reflects the input structure and the specified level names.

This corrected version should address the issues encountered in the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
