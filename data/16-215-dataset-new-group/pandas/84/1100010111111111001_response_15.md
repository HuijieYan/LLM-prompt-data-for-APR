### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when it processes multiple levels of a MultiIndex. The `clocs` parameter is a tuple consisting of two elements, which causes an issue when the function handles hierarchical columns.

When `clocs` is of length 2, the function should treat the level of the MultiIndex as a tuple. However, the function wrongly considers each element of the tuple separately, leading to the error: `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the case when `clocs` is a tuple of length 2. We should treat the level as a tuple and process it accordingly.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns when clocs is a tuple of length 2
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple) and len(clocs) == 2:
        clocs = [clocs]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    # No additional code needed for handling hierarchical columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected function, we have added a condition to check if `clocs` is a tuple of length 2. If so, we convert it into a list containing one tuple, otherwise, continue processing the list normally.

This modification ensures that the function processes the levels of the MultiIndex correctly when `clocs` is a tuple of length 2. This fix should resolve the error and enable the function to handle hierarchical columns as expected.
