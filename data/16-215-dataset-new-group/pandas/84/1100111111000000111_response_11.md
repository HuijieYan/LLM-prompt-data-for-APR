## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, the GitHub issue

From the GitHub issue, it is clear that the error is occurring due to the unwanted handling of MultiIndexes and an improper implementation of unstacking with tuple names. The error is causing a KeyError during the unstacking of Series, and the failing tests are also related to MultiIndex unstack issues.


## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The error might be stemming from the way MultiIndex is being handled, especially as the issue mentions tuple names that cause a KeyError. The specific code section where the `index._get_level_number(i)` involves getting the level number from the index, which might be the source of the issue.


## Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug is caused by an improper handling of MultiIndexes and tuple names in the `_unstack_multiple` function. This causes a KeyError exception when trying to retrieve the level number while unstacking the data. This behavior is clearly reported in the GitHub issue as well.


## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

The strategy for fixing the bug involves properly handling MultiIndexes and tuple names while unstacking the data. The function should be modified to handle MultiIndexes and tuple names correctly, addressing the reported issue to resolve the KeyError. Also, the use of `get_level_number` should be reviewed and corrected to ensure it works correctly with MultiIndexes.


## Provide a corrected version of the function

Based on the analysis, below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_names = [c if isinstance(c, tuple) else (c,) for c in clocs]  # Ensure clocs are tuple names

    cloc_indices = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in cloc_names]  # Get level number from tuple names

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_indices]
  
    # Remaining code that handles unstacking should remain unchanged
    ...
```

By checking if `clocs` are tuple names and using `index._get_level_number` with proper tuple names, this corrected version takes care of the mishandling of MultiIndexes and tuple names during the unstack operation.
