First, the issue's description refers to a problem occurring when trying to unstack a MultiIndexed Series using the `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` operation. This operation fails with a `KeyError` as it tries to get the level number for "A", which throws a 'Level A not found' error.

Upon analyzing the bug function `_unstack_multiple`, the issue occurs when the `clocs` list contains names of the levels in the MultiIndexed data. The error lies in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, where `index._get_level_number(i)` tries to retrieve the level number for a given level name `i`.

The main cause of the issue appears to be the usage of level names instead of level numbers when trying to unstack MultiIndexed data in the `unstack` method for Series. The function `_unstack_multiple` is not properly handling the case where the user provides tuple names instead of integer levels, resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to handle both level names and level numbers, providing a compatible solution for unstacking operations on MultiIndexed data accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, level, fill_value=None):
    if not isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
        level = [level]

    index = data.index

    # Convert level names to level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in level]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, the `level` parameter is converted from level names to level numbers using the `index._get_level_number` method if it's not already an integer. Additionally, the rest of the function remains the same without any significant changes. This modification allows providing compatibility for both level names and level numbers when unstacking MultiIndexed data, consequently resolving the Key Error issue.
