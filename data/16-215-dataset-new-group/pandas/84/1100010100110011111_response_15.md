The cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is the use of a tuple of levels `(level, ...)` as the argument for the `unstack` method. This argument is expected to be a single level. When the specified level is a tuple, it results in an error when trying to look up the level number in the index. This causes an error such as `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and `KeyError: 'Level A not found'`.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case when a tuple of levels is specified. If the argument is a tuple, we would perform the unstack operations sequentially, using each level one by one to ensure that all relevant levels are accounted for.

The corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function is shown below: 

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    result = data
    for c in clocs:
        result = result.unstack(c, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
``` 

This modification makes use of a loop to perform the unstack operation for each level present in the `clocs` list, addressing the issue of using a tuple as the `level` argument in the `unstack` method. This will resolve the error and ensure that the function handles the specified levels appropriately.
