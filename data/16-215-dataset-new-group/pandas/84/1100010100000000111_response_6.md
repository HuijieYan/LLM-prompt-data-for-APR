The provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple` causes a KeyError when attempting to run `s.unstack(("A", "a"))`. The error is coming from the method `_get_level_number`, particularly this line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` is unable to correctly interpret tuple names. 

To resolve this issue, a strategy could be to implement a conditional check for the type of `i` in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` to distinguish between string and tuple input. Then, if it's a string, simply use the `_get_level_number` method, and if it's a tuple, use the `index.names.index` method. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_indices = [index.names.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected function, a conditional check is implemented within the list comprehension to check the type of `i` and use a different method to obtain the level indices. This way, the function can handle both strings and tuples as column location indices.
