The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function originates from the incorrect handling of the `clocs` input parameter, which is expected to be a tuple. However, in the last case, the input is being passed as `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, causing the error. 

The function should be modified to handle a tuple of tuples instead of a tuple of strings. This requirement should be clearly documented and validated to prevent incorrect input types.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Ensure clocs is a tuple of tuples
    if not all(isinstance(c, tuple) for c in clocs):
        raise ValueError("The clocs parameter must be a tuple of tuples.")
    
    if not all(isinstance(ci, str) for c in clocs for ci in c):
        raise ValueError("The elements of the clocs tuples must be strings.")
    
    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding these validations, we can ensure that the `clocs` parameter is in the correct format before proceeding with the rest of the function.
