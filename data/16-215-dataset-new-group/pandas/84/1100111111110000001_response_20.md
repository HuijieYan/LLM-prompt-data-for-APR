Looking at the buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the cause of the bug is the use of `index._get_level_number(i)` without handling the situation where `i` is a tuple, which is causing the `ValueError` and `KeyError` when `index._get_level_number(i)` is called for multi-indexes. This is causing the function to fail both the provided tests.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to check whether `i` is a tuple or not. If it's a tuple, then we need to use `index._get_level_number` for each element in the tuple, and if it's not a tuple, then use `index._get_level_number` directly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    def _get_level_numbers(i):
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            return tuple(index._get_level_number(level) for level in i)
        else:
            return index._get_level_number(i)

    clocs = [_get_level_numbers(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
``` 

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing tests without causing the ValueError and KeyError.
