### Missing handling for tuples in the index names

The cause of the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the multilevel index handling. The function does not account for the possibility of tuple names in the index, as observed in the failing tests. This causes a failure when trying to unstack with those names.

### Suggested bug fix strategy

1. Modify the function to correctly handle the case when the index has tuple names.
2. Update the code to handle the presence of tuple names in the multi-index, performing the unstacking operation accordingly.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    level_names = [name[1] if isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in index.names]
    for cloc in clocs:
        if cloc in level_names:
            cloc_numbers.append(level_names.index(cloc))
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Level {cloc} not found")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
}
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional logic to handle the case when the index has tuple names. It maps the names to their corresponding level index and conducts unstacking operations accordingly.
