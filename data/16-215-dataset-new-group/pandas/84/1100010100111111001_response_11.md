## Issue Identification
The buggy function `_get_level_number` tries to find the level number based on the `level` received as input. It seems that the function is trying to find the index of the level `level` within the `names` list. The error messages indicate that it's either not finding it ("'A' is not in list") or failing with a KeyError ("Level {level} not found").

Let's analyze the situation:
1. The error message indicates that the function is trying to find the value `level` in the `names` list and is failing to do so.
2. The input `level` should be the level name, and its attempt to find an index within the list of names is causing the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix should involve modifying the `_get_level_number` function to correctly handle the input `level` as a name, not an index. Instead of searching for the index of the level name within the list of names, the function should return the level number directly based on the given name. 

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```
