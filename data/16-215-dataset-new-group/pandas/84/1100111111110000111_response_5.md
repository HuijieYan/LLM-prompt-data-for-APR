The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely occurring due to an inconsistency with the `MultiIndex` names when dealing with a `MultiIndex` with tuple names. Specifically, the issue arises when attempting to deal with the names `('A', 'a')` and `('B', 'b')`.

The bug appears to stem from the fact that the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class is not able to handle tuples as level names, and results in a KeyError when trying to retrieve the level number based on the provided index.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names more appropriately. This could involve ensuring that the level names are properly handled where appropriate and addressing any inconsistencies in the indexing logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Observe hierarchical columns
    if data.columns.nlevels > 1 and any(c in data.columns.names for c in clocs):
        level = data.columns.names.index(clocs[-1])
        clocs = clocs[:-1]

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function body remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In this updated version, the function is modified to handle cases where the column names are provided as tuples within the `clocs` parameter. The level name is extracted and removed from the `clocs` list, allowing the function to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names. This should resolve the KeyError issue when attempting to unstack MultiIndexes with tuple-based level names.
