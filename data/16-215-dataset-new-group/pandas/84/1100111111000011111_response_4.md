A bug has been identified in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The bug occurs when the function tries to deal with hierarchical columns. The function is failing to unstack multiple levels, which causes the KeyError error. The error arises from the inability to recognize a level within the multiindex.

To fix the bug, I will update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle multi-level index unstacking. A modification needs to be made for the function to deal with multi-level column names during unstacking.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This handles hierarchical columns by converting them to MultiIndex
    if not isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        # Convert the column index to MultiIndex if it's not already
        data.columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples([data.columns])

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function body remains unchanged...
```

The major change here is handling the case of hierarchical columns where the data columns are converted to `MultiIndex`. With this change, now the function should correctly handle multi-level column names during unstacking.

With this corrected version, the function is expected to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
