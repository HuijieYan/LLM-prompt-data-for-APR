The cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` is not properly handling the case when `rlocs` is empty, leading to incorrect handling of the MultiIndex columns. This results in an incorrect reshaping of the DataFrame, as observed in the runtime values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to include a specific condition to handle the case when `rlocs` is empty, ensuring that the reshaping of the DataFrame is performed correctly in this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if len(rlocs) == 0:  # Handle the case when rlocs is empty
        unstacked = data.unstack(list(clocs))  # Unstack using all levels in clocs
        return unstacked

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ... (code that handles the general case with rlocs not empty)
```

The added condition `if len(rlocs) == 0` checks if `rlocs` is empty, indicating that all levels for unstacking are in `clocs`. In this case, the function directly unstacks the data using all levels in `clocs`.

With this fix, the function will correctly handle the scenario when `rlocs` is empty, ensuring the correct reshaping of the DataFrame in that case.
