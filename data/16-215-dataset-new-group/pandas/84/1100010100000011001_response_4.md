The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely to be caused by incorrect manipulation of the index and columns. The function's logic for unstacking the data is also flawed, leading to unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to first properly handle the hierarchical columns and then unstack the data accordingly. We also need to ensure that the new index and columns are correctly formed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    if len(clocs) == index.nlevels:
        # Unstack all levels of the index
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Unstack only the specified levels
        group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
        comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)

        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=clevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=ccodes + [comp_ids],
            names=cnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the unstacking of the data based on the specified levels. It creates a new index and unstacks the data accordingly. This approach should address the issues with the original function and produce the expected output for the given cases.
