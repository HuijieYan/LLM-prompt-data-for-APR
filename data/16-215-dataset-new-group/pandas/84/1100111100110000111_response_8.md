The error originates from the `_unstack_multiple` method in `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`, causing the failing GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The key issue is `KeyError: 'Level A not found'`. The unstack operation is failing when unpacking a MultiIndex with a tuple for a name. The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class raises a KeyError stating that the provided level is not found. This occurs due to `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`.  `i` is a tuple containing names of index, which is an incorrect use. Therefore, clocs should transfer the level names to level numbers as being described in the error message from the failing test and also from the Github issue. 
This change should fix the functionality of the `_unstack_multiple`.
 
To resolve the bug, the clocs list must be created with the appropriate level numbers corresponding to the tuple in the method `_unstack_multiple`. This can be done by replacing `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` with suitable code that correctly fetches the level numbers. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    # Create a list with the level names to be found in the index
    level_names = [loc[1] for loc in index.names]

    # Get the level numbers for the names passed in clocs
    clocs = [level_names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
	
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```
This change in the function will fix the bug and allow the `_unstack_multiple` method to work correctly and resolve the GitHub issue.
