The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing a `KeyError` due to the level names not being found. The issue arises specifically when unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names using the `unstack` method. This leads to failure in the corresponding failing test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle hierarchical columns yet. The function is intended to unstack a DataFrame or Series with a MultiIndex. However, the code fails to correctly identify the level numbers for unstacking, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be improved to handle hierarchical columns and correctly extract the level numbers. Specifically, the `clocs` parameter, which represents the levels to unstack, needs to be properly processed to determine the correct level numbers for unstacking.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Process clocs to extract level numbers correctly
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # The rest of the function remains largely the same
    # ...
```

By explicitly checking if each entry in `clocs` is a tuple and applying a different method for obtaining level numbers in that case, we can resolve the KeyError issue.

Once this bug fix is applied, further test cases should pass, and the issue in the GitHub report should be resolved.
