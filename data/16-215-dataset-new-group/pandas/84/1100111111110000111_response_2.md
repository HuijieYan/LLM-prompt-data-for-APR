The cause of the bug is the `_get_level_number` function within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is called for clocs that are tuple names and results in a `ValueError` followed by a `KeyError`. The bug results in KeyError while unstack multiple levels with tuple names, leading to the failure of the provided tests.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method in the `pandas/pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` file should be modified to properly handle tuple names. The level should be handled accordingly as the `level` can be either a label (i.e., tuple name) or an integer.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevels, cnames = zip(*[(index.levels[i], index.names[i]) for i in clocs])

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels, rnames = zip(*[(index.levels[i], index.names[i]) for i in rlocs])

    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    group_index = get_group_index(index.codes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, index.codes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=recons_codes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By updating the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas/pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file with the above correction, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests should pass. This fix properly handles the `clocs` which can be either a label (tuple name) or an integer.

Lastly, ensure the fix is tested, and the modified source code is thoroughly reviewed before committing and releasing the change.
