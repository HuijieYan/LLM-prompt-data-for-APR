The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the manipulation of the data index and the unstacking process, especially when dealing with multiple levels of columns.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it fails to properly handle hierarchical columns when unstacking the data. Additionally, there are issues with the manipulation of index levels and codes, as well as the creation of dummy indices and MultiIndex objects.

To fix the bug, we should rewrite the logic for handling hierarchical columns and index manipulation, ensure that the MultiIndex objects are created correctly, and address the unstacking process for both Series and DataFrame inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # extract the index from the data
    index = data.index

    # identify the level numbers for the column locations
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # obtain the remaining (row) locations
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # separate levels, codes, and names for both column and row locations
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # define the shape based on the levels of the column locations
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    # use get_compressed_ids to get the group index
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False)

    # compress the group index to get comp_ids and obs_ids
    comp_ids, obs_ids = get_compressed_ids(group_index, sort=False)

    # deconstruct the compressed ids to get the recons_codes
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes)

    if not rlocs:
        # if there are no remaining locations, create a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        # create a MultiIndex with row locations and compressed ids
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # unstack the data based on the type of input (Series or DataFrame)
    # and handle hierarchical columns appropriately
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            dummy = data.copy()
            dummy.index = dummy_index
            unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the hierarchical columns, manipulates the index correctly, and unstacks the data based on the input type. This should resolve the previous bugs and ensure proper unstacking of the data.
