### Potential locations of error in the bug function:
1. The error `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` suggests that the function `_get_level_number` is expecting `level` to be an integer, but it's not receiving the expected input.
2. The error `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` suggests that the `level` is being interpreted as a string but is not found in the list.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the function `_get_level_number` trying to retrieve the index of the input `level`, expecting it to be an integer. However, the function is treating the `level` variable as a string in some cases, leading to the errors encountered.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
Based on the given input and the error messages, the issue arises from the input type of the `level`. The function should be updated to handle both integer and string inputs correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check the types for clocs and convert them to integers if they are strings
    clocs = [int(index._get_level_number(i)) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if the input `clocs` are of string types, and if so, the `clocs` are converted to integers before being passed to `_get_level_number`. This modification should address the issue and prevent the TypeError and KeyError cases.
