To fix the issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to address the error occurring in the `_get_level_number` method, which is called when attempting to unstack a multi-index DataFrame with the `df.unstack` function.

The function tries to get the level number for each column location in the index using the `_get_level_number` method. However, it fails when the code tries to recognize the level name 'A'.

The cause of the bug is that the code doesn't currently handle hierarchical columns correctly. It confuses the level name with the value at that level.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to ensure it correctly handles hierarchical columns and retrieves the correct level numbers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

The key modification is in this line:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

This modification checks if the `clocs` elements are tuples (which indicates hierarchical columns) and gets the level number of the first element of the tuple.

With this change, the corrected function should handle the hierarchy in column names correctly and return the expected output for the failing test cases.
