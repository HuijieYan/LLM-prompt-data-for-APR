### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to unstacking a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns using a tuple of names as the level to unstack. The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It seems to be a case of mishandling multi-level columns with unstack.

#### Potential error locations within the buggy function
- The code transforming `clocs` is incorrect.
- The initialization of `dummy_index` for cases where elements are in `rlocs` is causing a problem.
- The code segments for dealing with `Series` and `DataFrame` looks incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by misalignment while handling MultiIndex columns during unstacking. It's also possible that the handling of `clocs` does not consider multi-level columns, leading to incorrect behavior when unstacking.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix should address the misalignment of the columns during unstacking and ensure that the logic for handling MultiIndex columns is working correctly.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Transform the clocs into a list of level numbers
    # The original code is incorrect and returns a level number instead of a list, which causes issues in the subsequent code blocks
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        # Construct a MultiIndex for dummy_index including elements from rlocs
        # The original method of constructing dummy_index is incorrect and causes issues with multi-level columns
        # Construct a MultiIndex including elements from rlocs and repurpose for summary index for levels from clocs
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=[
                index.levels[i] for i in rlocs
            ] + [obs_ids],
            codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [comp_ids],
            names=[index.names[i] for i in rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # Copy the data frame and update index to dummy_index
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    # Unstack the dummy using "__placeholder__" as the unstacking level
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
This revised code addresses the mishandling of multi-level columns, transforms `clocs` correctly, and reconstructs `dummy_index` based on the levels related to unstacking in the MultiIndex. This revised method should behave correctly in a scenario where MultiIndex with multi-level columns is involved when unstacking.
