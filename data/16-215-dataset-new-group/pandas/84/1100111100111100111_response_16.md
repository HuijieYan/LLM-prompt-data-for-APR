The issue is related to the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is failing to interpret the `clocs` input parameter. The issue occurs when the index is a MultiIndex with tuple names, and the call to `index._get_level_number(i)` in the `_unstack_multiple` function is not handling the tuple names correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` function is not correctly handling tuple names in the MultiIndex. This causes an error when trying to get the level number for the provided tuple names, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex when getting the level number. We should consider splitting the input tuple names into individual components and then extracting level numbers for each component.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            tuple_level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(l) for l in loc]
            level_numbers.append(tuple_level_numbers)
        else:
            level_number = index._get_level_number(loc)
            level_numbers.append(level_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
}
```

With this modification, the function should be able to correctly handle both single level names and tuple names in the MultiIndex, resolving the KeyError issue.
