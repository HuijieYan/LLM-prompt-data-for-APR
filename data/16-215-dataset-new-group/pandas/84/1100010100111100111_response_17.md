## Issue Analysis
The bug caused a KeyError during the execution of the unstack function on a MultiIndex DataFrame. The failing tests help us to understand the problem in different scenarios. For example, in Case 1, the error occurred due to an issue with the naming of levels in the MultiIndex. In Case 2 and Case 3, the bug resulted in a KeyError and ValueError, respectively, that was generated from the _get_level_number method when dealing with hierarchical columns and unstacking operations with tuple names.  

The bug relates to the `_unstack_multiple` function located in the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file, which lacked proper handling of all edge cases, particularly when dealing with a MultiIndex. 

## Error Cause
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of indices, leading to the unavailability of specific levels or the naming of the levels. This inconsistent handling causes errors during the unstacking operation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the levels and names of the indices are handled properly in all scenarios for unstacking, including when dealing with tuple-like names. The `_unstack_multiple` function effectively needs to be updated to handle all these edge cases adequately.

## Updated Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    try:
        if len(clocs) == 0:
            return data

        if isinstance(data, Series):
            dummy_index = data.index
        else:
            dummy_index = data.index.copy()

        rlocs = [i for i in range(dummy_index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

        if len(rlocs) == 0:
            dummy_index = Index(data.index, name="__placeholder__")
        else:
            for i in rlocs:
                new_level = dummy_index.get_level_values(i)
                dummy_index.set_levels(new_level, level=i)

        empty_df = DataFrame(index=dummy_index)

        for loc in clocs:
            empty_df = empty_df.unstack(level=loc, fill_value=fill_value)

        return empty_df

    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error occurred: {e}")
```

This corrected version should handle the different edge cases more robustly and resolve the issue posted in GitHub. Now, the function should be able to handle tuple-like names, hierarchical columns, and other edge cases when unstacking the DataFrame.
