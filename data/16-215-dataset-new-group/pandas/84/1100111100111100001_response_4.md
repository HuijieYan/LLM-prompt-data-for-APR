The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it assumes clocs is a list of level names to unstack, but it actually has a different format, either a tuple of level names and a level name or just a single level name.

The first case represents unstacking a single level name, for example "A". The second case represents unstacking multiple levels with the format (("A", "a"), "B"). 

The function incorrectly tries to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`, assuming `i` is a level name. If `i` is a tuple, it's taken as the incorrect format and fails to find the level number. The assumption that `i` is a single value causes the function to fail when it then tries to access that index directly.

We can fix the bug by first checking the type of clocs, and for each level, checking if it is a single level name or a tuple of level names. If it's a tuple, we need to use the first value from the tuple and fall back to the second value if the first one is not found.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    unstacked_levels = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            level1 = index._get_level_number(cloc[0])
            if level1 is None:
                level1 = index._get_level_number(cloc[1])
            unstacked_levels.append(level1)
        else:
            level = index._get_level_number(cloc)
            unstacked_levels.append(level)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in unstacked_levels]

    # the rest of the original _unstack_multiple function
    # ...
```

This fixed function first checks if clocs is a tuple, and then appropriately handles the different formats by getting the level numbers before continuing with the unstacking process.
