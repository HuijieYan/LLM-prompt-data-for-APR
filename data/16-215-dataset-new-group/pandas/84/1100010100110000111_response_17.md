The issue is caused by the `_get_level_number` method that tries to get the index of the level from the given list of names in a MultiIndex. The method does not handle the case when the level is specified as a tuple of names. This results in a KeyError, indicating that the 'Level A' is not found in the list.

To fix this issue, the `_get_level_number` method should be modified to handle tuple names appropriately. It should check if the input level is a tuple, and if so, get the index of the tuple of names instead of just the individual name.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... the remaining code remains the same
```

In the corrected version, the `clocs` list comprehension includes a check for whether the current `i` is a tuple. If it is, the `_get_level_number` method is called with the entire tuple. This change allows the code to correctly identify the levels based on tuple names.
