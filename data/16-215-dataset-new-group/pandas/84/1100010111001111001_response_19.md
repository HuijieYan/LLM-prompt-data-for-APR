The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be caused by incorrect variable assignments and operations inside the function. The function is not correctly handling multi-level index data and is resulting in an incorrect unstacked DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-level index data and unstack it to produce the expected output.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    level_values = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in range(index.nlevels)]
    
    # Unstack the DataFrame based on the specified clocs
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    
    return unstacked
```

With this corrected version, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly unstack the DataFrame and produce the expected output for the failing tests.
