The issue appears to be caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `pandas.core.reshape.reshape.py` file. The function attempts to unstack a `MultiIndex` with tuple names in a specific way, but it currently fails due to a KeyError when trying to obtain the level number.

The cause of the bug is that the `clocs` variable is being incorrectly assigned a list of integers when it's supposed to contain a tuple. This causes an error when trying to obtain the level number using the `index._get_level_number(i)` method within a list comprehension.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the way `clocs` is being assigned. Since the input parameter `clocs` represents the levels to be unstacked, it should retain its original format when being passed in as a tuple. The code should be adjusted to handle this tuple when obtaining the level number from the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]
        
    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(l) for l in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making this change, the function should be able to appropriately handle the input `clocs` as either a tuple or a list of tuples, and obtain the level numbers for unstacking from the index without encountering a KeyError. This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and allow the function to work correctly with the failing tests.
