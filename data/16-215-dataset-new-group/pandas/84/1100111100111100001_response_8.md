The issue lies with the transformation of the `clocs` input, which is intended to represent a level number in the multi-index, into the corresponding index. This is currently done using `index._get_level_number(i)`, which is resulting in a `ValueError` being raised indicating that the specified level is not found.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` fails when attempting to retrieve the level number for the `clocs` in the `index`. The `clocs` parameter represents a tuple that needs to map onto the levels in the multi-index `index`. The code attempts to retrieve the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` for each `i` in `clocs`. This is where the error occurs, as `index._get_level_number(i)` is not correctly processing the input.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the code for obtaining the level numbers from the `clocs`. Instead of using `index._get_level_number(i)`, which seems to be causing the error, we can add custom logic to identify the level number based on the input `clocs`.

Based on the analysis, we can provide the corrected version as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result

    index = data.index
    # Update clocs to handle tuples
    if not isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = (clocs,)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making these changes, we handle the case where `clocs` is passed as a tuple and ensure that it correctly maps onto the levels in the multi-index `index`. This updated logic should address the ValueError and KeyError issues encountered in the failing tests.
