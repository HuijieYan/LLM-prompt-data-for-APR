The bug in the code seems to be related to the `KeyError` exception encountered when trying to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex using a tuple of level names resulting in Level 'A' not found.

The potential error locations within the code are:
1. The `clocs` list might not contain the level values which the `_get_level_number` is unable to find.
2. Handling of the indices and codes of the data MultiIndex and the resulting `dummy_index` might have issues with respect to being able to handle the nested tuple names.

The cause of the bug is using the `_get_level_number` function without properly handling the case of specifying a tuple of column names as a level for unstacking the Series with MultiIndex. This results in a KeyError when trying to access the respective levels. 

A strategy for fixing the bug is to refactor the code to handle the case of using a tuple of level names when unstacking. This can involve creating separate paths for handling the tuples differently and identifying the correct levels to unstack based on the tuple elements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    result = data

    if isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(c, (str, tuple)) for c in clocs):
        col_names = [clocs] if isinstance(clocs, str) or not any(isinstance(c, (list, tuple)) for c in clocs) else list(clocs)
        levels_values = sum(col_names, ())
        remaining_levels = [lev for lev in index.names if lev not in levels_values]

        result = result.unstack(col_names, fill_value=fill_value)

        new_columns = [col_name if isinstance(col_name, str) else '-'.join(col_name) for col_name in col_names]
        new_columns = Index(result.columns.map(lambda x: x[1]).tolist(), name=new_columns)

        return result.set_axis(new_columns, axis=1)

    # For single-level unstack
    if len(clocs) == 1:
        loc = index._get_level_number(clocs[0])
        result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)
    elif isinstance(clocs, list) and all(isinstance(i, int) for i in clocs):
        # Handling unstack based on integers (level position)
        result = result.unstack(clocs)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid input for clocs: {clocs}")

    return result
```

In this corrected version, an additional conditional path is created to handle the case when a tuple of level names is used. It then maps the column names to the sum of elements in the tuples, and unmstack based on the column names provided. This should adequately fix the unstacking issues related to tuple names.
