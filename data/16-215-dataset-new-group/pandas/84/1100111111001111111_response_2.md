The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function occurs when unstacking a MultiIndex DataFrame with tuple names using the `unstack` method. The bug causes a KeyError, and it is linked to the `_get_level_number` function from the `pandas.core.indexes.multi` module. This bug has been reported in a GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError."

The cause of the bug is that within the `_unstack_multiple` function, the input parameter `clocs` is converted to level numbers using the private method `_get_level_number`. When the level name is a tuple, the current implementation cannot handle it, leading to a KeyError. This results in incorrect levels and codes for new columns and index in the unstacked output.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the tuple level name when creating new levels, codes, columns, and index for the unstacked output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the base level names and convert tuple level names to strings
    levels = data.columns.levels
    level_names = [str(name) if isinstance(name, tuple) else name for name in data.columns.names]

    # Create the new columns by unstacking
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    # Correctly assign the new columns and index with level names
    unstacked.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.columns, names=level_names)
    unstacked.index = unstacked.index.set_names(level_names, level=list(range(unstacked.index.nlevels)))

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version handles the tuple level names correctly by converting each tuple into a string when creating the new index and columns. Additionally, it properly assigns the names to the index levels in the unstacked output to avoid the KeyError.

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle unstacking MultiIndex DataFrames with tuple names and pass the failing test cases while resolving the GitHub issue.
