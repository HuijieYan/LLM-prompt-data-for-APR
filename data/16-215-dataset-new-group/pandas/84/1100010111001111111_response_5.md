The bug in the given function _unstack_multiple occurs when handling the `clocs` parameter. The function was written assuming that it only deals with MultiIndexes and only a single level, but it fails when this assumption is not met. The provided GitHub issue also points out that unstacking when the columns have a tuple for a name fails.

The fix for the bug would involve checking the type of index and handling the different cases accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    index = data.index

    # Check if index is a MultiIndex
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
            clocs = [clocs]

        if all(isinstance(cloc, tuple) for cloc in clocs):
            unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
        else:
            unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)

        return unstacked
    else:
        return NotImplemented  # Either raise an error or return something appropriate for non-MultiIndex data
```

This corrected version of the function checks if the index is a MultiIndex, and unstacks the data accordingly. It also considers the case where `clocs` is a tuple, and unstacks based on the tuple. If the index is not a MultiIndex, it returns a `NotImplemented` value, which could be replaced with an error raise or another appropriate return value based on specific requirements.
