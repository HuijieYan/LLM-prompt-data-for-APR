The function `_unstack_multiple` tries to unstack a DataFrame or a Series along multiple columns. However, it contains several issues:

1. The function does not handle hierarchical columns properly.
2. In the case of a Series, it uses a placeholder index for unstacking which does not align with the actual index arrangements.

To fix the bug:
- We need to handle hierarchical columns properly by checking for MultiIndex columns and applying unstacking recursively.
- Properly construct the new index for unstacked Series.
- Simplify the logic for unstacking the DataFrame and Series.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    stacked = data
    for col_loc in clocs:
        stacked = stacked.unstack(col_loc, fill_value=fill_value)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        stacked.index = stacked.index.droplevel(-1)

    return stacked
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the input data has a MultiIndex column. If not, we directly apply the unstacking operation and return the result. If it has a MultiIndex column, we use a recursive unstacking approach to handle hierarchical columns. Finally, for the resulting Series, we drop the last level of the index to align it properly.

This version simplifies the logic and properly handles the unstacking operation for both DataFrames and Series.
