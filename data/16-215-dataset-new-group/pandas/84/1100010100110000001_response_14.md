# Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
The `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` error occurs at line 320 in the `_unstack_multiple` function because the list comprehension in that line potentially raises the error due to the index `A` not being present in the level names.

# Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the corresponding error message
The `_get_level_number` method is unable to find the value `'A'` in the `names` list, which is causing a `ValueError` to be raised in the `_unstack_multiple` function, ultimately leading to a `KeyError` when the index is not found.

# Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
A potential fix would be to use exception handling at the specific line of code to catch the `ValueError` if the index is not in the list of names. Additionally, we need to confirm the correct parameter being passed to the `_get_level_number` function.

# The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]  # Added type check

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

In the corrected version, we added a type check to ensure that `clocs` contains only string values before calling `_get_level_number`. This should avoid raising the `ValueError`.
