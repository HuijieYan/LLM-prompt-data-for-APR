The root cause of the buggy function is that the function `_get_level_number()` is attempting to find the level number corresponding to the input level. This is done by checking the existence of the input level in the list of level names (`self.names`) and subsequently retrieving its index. However, this implementation is failing in handling MultiIndex with Tuple in the names, leading to errors such as `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` as observed in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to handle MultiIndex with Tuple level names properly, especially the `_get_level_number()` method to support tuple level names. This can be achieved by performing checks to handle both single-level and multi-level input levels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Updated the clocs identification to handle tuple level names
    levels = [index.names[i] for i in range(index.nlevels)]
    
    level_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            level_number = [(i, j.index(k)) for i, j in enumerate(levels) for k in j if i == cloc[0] and k == cloc[1]]
            if level_number:
                level_numbers.extend(level_number)
            else:
                raise KeyError(f"Level {cloc} not found")
        else:
            level_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)
            level_numbers.append(level_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [c[0] for c in level_numbers]]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in [c[0] for c in level_numbers]]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in [c[0] for c in level_numbers]]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in [c[0] for c in level_numbers]]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i, loc in level_numbers:
                result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[i] if isinstance(data.columns.names, (list, tuple)) else data.columns.names for i in (unstcols.names, data.columns.names)] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

With these changes, the test cases for both single-level and multi-level levels with tuple names should pass without errors.
