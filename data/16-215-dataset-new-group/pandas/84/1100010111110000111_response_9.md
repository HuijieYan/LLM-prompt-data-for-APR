### Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function takes `data`, `clocs`, and `fill_value` as its parameters and performs unstacking on the DataFrame. The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of hierarchical indexes in the `unstack` function, which causes KeyError and ValueError during the unstacking process.

The test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` fails with the error message: ValueError: 'A' is not in list, and the call to `df.unstack(("A", "a"))` triggers the error.

Moreover, the test `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` also fails with the same error. 

The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" details the problem encountered when unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex containing tuple names, such as in the failing tests.

### Error Location
The primary errors occur due to the improper processing of the column MultiIndex layers `clocs` inside the `_unstack_multiple` function.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of `clocs`, which results in the program throwing KeyError and ValueError. The root cause seems to be the incorrect alignment of column and index levels when handling the unstacking operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this, we need to correct the handling of the MultiIndex levels while performing the unstack operation. The correct layer must be used to unstack the DataFrame properly, aligning the column and index levels as expected.

### The Corrected Function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(clocs, list):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `clocs` list is processed to handle both single and multi-level columns properly. This should resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues during the unstacking process.
