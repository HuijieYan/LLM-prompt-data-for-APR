The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be that it does not handle nested levels of MultiIndex correctly. The function is trying to process each level separately, but the logic for handling nested levels is missing.

The bug occurs in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` because it assumes the tuple of levels `('A', 'a')` can be directly used as indices to extract level numbers with `_get_level_number`. However, this assumes a single-level index and does not correctly handle MultiIndex with nested levels.

To fix the bug, the _unstack_multiple function needs to be modified to correctly handle MultiIndex with nested levels. It should identify the levels and their position within the MultiIndex and then proceed with the unstacking process accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function, which includes handling MultiIndex with nested levels:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # handle MultiIndex with nested levels
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        cloc_numbers = [data.index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [data.index._get_level_number(clocs)]
    # rest of the function logic remains unchanged
```

This fix ensures that the `clocs` tuple is correctly handled for MultiIndex with nested levels, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
