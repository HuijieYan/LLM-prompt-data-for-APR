The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it is not handling the MultiIndex type properly, causing the errors in the test cases that are using MultiIndex. The main problem lies in how the `clocs` values are being processed to determine the level numbers, which leads to errors when creating the dummy index and unstacking the data.

### Bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function
1. The function does not properly handle MultiIndex type data, and the logic to determine the level numbers is not suitable for MultiIndex.
2. The manipulation of index levels, codes, and names is causing the data structure to be improperly modified and leading to errors in unstacking.

### Strategy to fix the bug
1. Modify the logic to properly handle MultiIndex data.
2. Use appropriate methods to extract information from MultiIndex, such as `get_level_values` instead of directly working with levels and codes.

### Updated and Fixed `_unstack_multiple` function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level values from clocs
    levels = [cloc[0] for cloc in clocs]
    names = [cloc[1] for cloc in clocs]

    # Create a MultiIndex object with the specified levels and names
    dummy_index = data.index.droplevel(levels).unique()
    dummy_index = dummy_index.set_names('__placeholder__', level=names)

    # Unstack the data using the level names and fill value
    unstacked = data.unstack(level=levels, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This modified function should correctly handle the MultiIndex data and avoid the errors observed in the failing test cases. The use of `droplevel` and `unique` methods ensures that the MultiIndex is modified appropriately, and unstacking is performed with the correct level names and fill value.

By implementing these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to correctly handle the MultiIndex data without raising any errors, as observed in the failing test cases.
