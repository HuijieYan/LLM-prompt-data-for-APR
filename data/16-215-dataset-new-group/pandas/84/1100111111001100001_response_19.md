The bug appears to be in the block of code that handles a DataFrame that is not a Series. This is evident from the failing test results and the block of code that checks if the input data is a DataFrame. Further, there is an issue with the column names and multi-index creation for the buggy function. 

The buggy function fails in the following scenarios:

1. Unstacking of a MultiIndex DataFrame with tuple names fails.
2. Unstacking of a DataFrame with mixed types in the column name MultiIndex fails.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` incorrectly handles the unstacking process for the given input scenarios due to the incorrect indexing for the returned `unstacked` DataFrame. It fails to correctly align the levels, codes, columns, names, and other attributes in the returned DataFrame.

The strategy to fix the bug will involve:
- Addressing the handling of the DataFrame that is not a Series, ensuring that the unstacking process is correctly executed.
- Correctly aligning the levels, codes, columns, names, and other attributes in the returned DataFrame to ensure that the unstacking process works as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=index.names + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues mentioned and correctly perform the unstacking process for the various input scenarios provided.
