## The buggy function and its relationship with the error message
The function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to handle MultiIndexed data but is encountering errors because the names of the levels are specified as tuples instead of individual strings. This leads to the function not being able to find these levels when trying to retrieve the level number from the index, raising both `ValueError` and `KeyError` and finally failing to unstack the data.

## Potential error locations
1. The assignment of `clocs` is to be looked into as the error occurs just after this step.
2. The manipulation of indices based on the levels is also a potential culprit. 

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the difference in the representation of the index names. With the current implementation, the function is unable to properly handle index names that are specified as tuples instead of strings.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to treat multi-index levels that are specified as tuples correctly. The code should be modified to handle both tuple and individual string representations of index names correctly.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # index and level manipulation
    index = data.index
    levels = index.levels
    
    # Extracting the level numbers directly from the level names
    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_num = tuple([levels[i].names.index(name) for i, name in enumerate(loc)])
        else:
            level_num = levels[loc].names.index(loc)
            
        level_numbers.append(level_num)

    # Setup for dummy index
    from itertools import product
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(product(*[levels[loc] for loc in level_numbers]))
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(product(*[levels[loc] for loc in level_numbers]))
    
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    
    # Unstacking using the conventional method
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(level_numbers[-1], fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```
