Based on the error messages and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, the issue is related to the incorrect handling of MultiIndex and tuple names when trying to unstack a DataFrame. 

The bug arises from the `_get_level_number` function being called on a MultiIndex with tuple names, which results in errors such as "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" and "KeyError: 'Level A not found'". This happens because `_get_level_number` expects a level number, not a tuple name.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly and convert the tuple names to level numbers. The bug also requires updating the error handling to provide more informative and accurate error messages. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index.get_loc(c) for c in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same...
}
```

In this corrected version, if the `clocs` parameter is a tuple, we use the `get_loc` function to get the level numbers from the tuple names. If the `clocs` parameter is not a tuple, we continue to use `_get_level_number` as before. This change ensures that the function can handle both single levels and tuple names correctly.

With this change, the corrected function should now handle MultiIndex with tuple names and unstack the DataFrame without raising an error.

It's important to thoroughly test this corrected function with various input scenarios to ensure its correctness. Additionally, you may need to refactor the related `_get_level_number` function as well to provide consistent behavior.
