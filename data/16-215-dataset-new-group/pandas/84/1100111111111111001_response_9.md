The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by the incorrect indexing of the `clocs` variable. It is intended to handle two different types of input for `clocs`:
1. A single level
2. A tuple of level names within a MultiIndex

To fix this bug, we need to verify the type of `clocs` and handle each case appropriately. Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Case for a MultiIndex
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:  # Case for a single level
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function first checks the type of `clocs` to determine whether it is a MultiIndex or a single level. Then it proceeds accordingly.

This fix will ensure that the function correctly handles both single level and MultiIndex input for `clocs`, resolving the bug identified in the failing test cases.
