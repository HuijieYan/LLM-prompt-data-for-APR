Here's a step-by-step approach to fix the buggy function:

1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions: The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is called by the `unstack` function in the pandas library. It is responsible for unstacking a Series or DataFrame to produce a reshaped output based on provided indexes.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:  The error seems to occur when the `_unstack_multiple` function tries to access MultiIndex levels using the level name as a string.

3. The cause of the bug: The bug occurs due to the confusion between level names and level positions within the MultiIndex.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug: The error can be addressed by ensuring that the levels are correctly identified by their numeric positions rather than by their names.

5. Given the buggy function, here's a corrected version:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [level if isinstance(level, int) else index.names.index(level) for level in clocs] # using level positions

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

```

In the corrected version, the line `clocs = [level if isinstance(level, int) else index.names.index(level) for level in clocs]` ensures that the levels are correctly identified by their numeric positions, handling both cases where level names or level positions are provided.

This correction should address the bug related to unstacking MultiIndexed data where the level names were not being handled correctly resulting in a KeyError.
