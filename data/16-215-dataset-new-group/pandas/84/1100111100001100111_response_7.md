The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the improper handling of multi-index and incorrect manipulation of the index and column levels of the input DataFrame. This results in incorrect unstacking and column indexing, leading to errors or incorrect results. The input parameter `clocs` is the level based on which we're trying to unstack the data before stacking it back up. The other input parameter `data` is the DataFrame on which we're going to apply the unstacking operation.

The GitHub issue provides an example where `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` fails with a KeyError. This is due to difficulty understanding multi-indexed columns and is relevant to the failure cases mentioned here.

An ideal bug-fix approach would involve the correct selection of index and column levels, handling of multi-index, and proper unstacking operation to achieve the required reshaping of the DataFrame.

The function `_unstack_multiple` can be corrected as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index and columns of the DataFrame
    index = data.index
    columns = data.columns
    
    # Get the level numbers for the specified clocs
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    # Check if data is a Series or a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns
    if isinstance(data, Series) or isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        # Unstack the DataFrame at the specified levels
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        
    else:
        # Unstack the DataFrame at the specified levels
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        
        # Reconstruct the columns based on unstacked values and clocs
        new_columns = index.remap_axis(unstacked.columns, clocs, level=0)
        
        # Set the unstacked DataFrame with the newly constructed columns
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this correction, we properly handle different scenarios based on whether the input data is a Series or a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. The unstack operation is performed based on the specified levels, and then the resulting unstacked DataFrame is processed to reconstruct the columns based on the original index and column levels. Lastly, the unstacked DataFrame's columns are set to the reconstructed columns.

This corrected function should address the bug and provide the expected results for unstacking multi-indexed DataFrames.
