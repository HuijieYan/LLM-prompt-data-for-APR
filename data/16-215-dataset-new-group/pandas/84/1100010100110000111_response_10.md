The bug in the `_unstack_multilevel` function is related to the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. This error occurs when the method `_get_level_number` returns an error stating that the provided level `A` is not found in the list. The error originates from this line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` as it takes in the level names as input during the unstack operation. Once the error occurs during this step, it propagates to the `unstack` method and returns a KeyError.

The root issue can be traced to the wrong type of the clocs being updated to different types.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the `clocs` variable that is returned from `index._get_level_number(i)` consists of integer level numbers or tuple numbers and not names.

After analyzing the code, the `_get_level_number` method should return the index value of the provided level name, so its usage within the `_unstack_multilevel` function should be checked.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multilevel` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

The conditional in the above code will check the type of `i` and only call `_get_level_number` when `i` is a string, which will fix the error occurring in the previous implementation.
