The issue stems from the `_unstack_multiple` function inside the `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py` file. Specifically, the `clocs` list provided in the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line seems to be causing the error.

The error message indicates that the `index._get_level_number` method is raising a `ValueError` with the message "'A' is not in list", which is then caught and re-raised as a `KeyError` with the message "Level A not found".

The failing test cases `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` help in reproducing this bug.

The committed issue on GitHub provides details about this bug. It describes that unstacking with tuple names fails with a KeyError when trying to unstack multi-indexed data.

To fix this bug, you need to make modifications to the `_unstack_multiple` function where the `clocs` list is used and the `_get_level_number` method is called.

Here's an updated, corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

This correction ensures that each level is properly checked before calling the `_get_level_number` method to avoid the KeyError issue.

With these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
