## Issues
The `ValueError` has been raised because it seems that the names passed to the `unstack` function are not being recognized as valid level names. The error seems to be occurring inside the `_unstack_multiple` function, and more specifically, when attempting to get the level number using the `_get_level_number` method.

Additionally, the failing test cases suggest that the issue is related to the `clocs` parameter being used inside the `_unstack_multiple` function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the names passed to the `unstack` function are recognized as valid level names.
2. Verify that the `clocs` parameter contains appropriate values that match the levels in the index. There might be issues with the way the level numbers are being calculated and handled.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Ensure that the passed names are always iterable
    clocs = [clocs] if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)) else clocs

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, the minor changes are made to ensure that the names passed to `unstack` are always treated as an iterable (in case they are not already), and the loop that processes the `clocs` parameter has been updated to handle both index names and index numbers.

These changes should address the issues with the earlier implementation and help resolve the failing test cases.
