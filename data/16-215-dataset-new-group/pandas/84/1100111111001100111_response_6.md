The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to an error in the index handling logic. Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, as well as the failing test and the GitHub issue description, it appears the issue arises from handling the tuple names within the MultiIndex.

The cause of the bug can be explained through the following points:
1. The `_unstack_multiple` function attempts to handle multi-level column names in the index, but there is a flaw when trying to operate with multi-level tuples as levels in the index.
2. The given failing test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and the associated runtime values and types illustrate that when unstacking based on the tuple names in the MultiIndex, the function produces an incorrect result.
3. The GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" combines multiple examples that demonstrate the failure due to the tuple names in the index causing a KeyError to be raised.

Based on the analysis, a potential correction strategy to fix the bug would involve modifying the logic for handling multi-level tuples within the function. This correction should assess and handle multi-level tuples when they are present in the index structure.

Below, a corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple` is provided, attempting to address the identified issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Original index handling logic
    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Revised logic for handling tuple names
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs_new = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        cloc_indices = []
        for name in cloc:
            level_number = index._get_level_number(name)
            cloc_indices.append(level_number)
        clocs_new.append(tuple(cloc_indices))
    clocs = clocs_new

    # Rest of the function's logic...
```

In the corrected version, the function specifically handles tuple names within the index by converting the tuple of names into a tuple of level numbers. This revised logic should address the KeyError and related issues when dealing with multi-level tuples in the index.

It is important to rigorously test and validate the corrected function using the failing tests and additional cases to ensure that it provides the expected results and resolves the GitHub issue.
