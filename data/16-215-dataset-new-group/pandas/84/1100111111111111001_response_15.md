## The bug
The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` method being called with a tuple instead of a string as the argument. This triggers the error message `ValueError: 'A' is not in list`.

## The fix
The `_get_level_number` method should be called with a string, so we need to ensure that the `clocs` input parameter is unpacked when passed to `_get_level_number`. We will do this by modifying the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` in the buggy function to ensure that the `clocs` tuple is unpacked when passed to `_get_level_number`.

## The corrected function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(*i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```
