The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the way the `clocs` parameter is being processed. The `clocs` list contains tuples and strings, but the code attempts to pass the values in the `clocs` list to the `index._get_level_number` method, which only accepts strings. This leads to a ValueError when a tuple is encountered.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way `clocs` are processed. If a tuple is encountered, we should take the first element of the tuple to be the level name.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs_processed = [(index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs_processed]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we introduced the `clocs_processed` list, which takes into account the case where the elements of `clocs` are tuples. We modified the list comprehension to process the `clocs` elements accordingly, allowing the code to handle tuples and strings correctly.

This fix addresses the bug by ensuring that the `clocs` variable is handled correctly within the function. With this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now work as expected with the failing tests.
