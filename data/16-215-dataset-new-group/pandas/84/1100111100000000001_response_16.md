The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a MultiIndex DataFrame or Series. The bug in this function seems to be related to the handling of hierarchical columns.

One potential error location is the section of the code that checks if `rlocs` is an empty list. This condition may not accurately capture the scenario where the MultiIndex contains hierarchical columns.

The bug causes incorrect unstacking of the data when dealing with hierarchical columns, leading to incorrect index and column structures.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to improve the handling of hierarchical columns and ensure that the unstacking process correctly preserves the index and column structures.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    if len(clocs) == index.nlevels:
        return data.unstack()
    
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    # handling hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack()
    else:
        unstacked = data.copy()
        for level in clocs:
            unstacked = unstacked.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
        
    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, we handle the scenario where the number of levels in `clocs` equals the number of levels in the index. This situation can be addressed by directly calling `data.unstack()`.

For the case of hierarchical columns, we iterate through the specified levels in `clocs` and unstack the data accordingly. This approach ensures that the unstacking process correctly preserves the index and column structures for both Series and DataFrames.
