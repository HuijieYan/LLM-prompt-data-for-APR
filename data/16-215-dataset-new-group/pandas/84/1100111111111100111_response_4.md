Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the failing test cases, we can identify several issues with the `_unstack_multiple` function:

1. The function incorrectly handles multi-index data when level contains tuples.
2. There are issues with how `clocs`, `rlocs`, `clevels`, `ccodes`, `cnames`, `rlevels`, `rcodes`, and `rnames` are being manipulated and assigned for multi-index data.
3. The lines that determine how to set values for `dummy_index`, `dummy`, and `new_columns` are not handling multi-index data appropriately.

To address these issues, we can consider a more robust approach to handle multi-index data with tuple levels. This might involve identifying levels by names and reformatting the data according to the provided multi-index.

For instance, the strategy for fixing the bug in `_unstack_multiple` involves updating the logic for identifying levels within the provided `clocs` and updating the reorganization of the data according to the provided multi-index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Determine correct index based on the level
    ix = data.index
    for l in clocs:
        ix = ix.get_level_values(l)

    # Prepare the reorganized data
    result = data.unstack(level=clocs).reorder_levels(ix.names)

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function provides a more robust approach to handling multi-index data with tuple levels and should resolve the issues reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
