The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to how the function processes the clocs variable. The function attempts to extract the level numbers from the index, but it fails to handle multi-level indices correctly, resulting in a ValueError. 

To fix the bug, the function should check if the index is a MultiIndex and then properly process the level numbers based on that condition.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [
            index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i 
            for i in clocs
        ]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # The rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

The correction involves checking if the index is a MultiIndex, and then applying the appropriate processing to the clocs variable based on that condition.

By making this change, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly process the clocs variable and produce the expected unstacked output.
