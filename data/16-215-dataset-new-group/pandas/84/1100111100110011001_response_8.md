### Bug analysis
The bug happens in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to get the level number from the index using the `_get_level_number` function. Specifically, the error occurs due to the multi-level index names not being recognized as a single tuple but as separate strings. This leads to the level name "A" not being found in the list of names.

### Bug location
The cause of the bug is the input parameter `clocs` in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function incorrectly assumes that the input represents specific level numbers and fails due to the mismatch in the index's naming convention.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be updated to extract the level number correctly from the index using the input parameter `clocs`. Furthermore, the function should handle multi-level index names properly to avoid the errors caused by assuming the level names are present as single strings.

### Updated and corrected function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number((i,)) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # remaining code unchanged
}
```

This corrected function accurately handles the input parameter `clocs`, properly identifying the level number from multi-level index names. This will prevent the errors caused by incorrect assumptions about the level names.
