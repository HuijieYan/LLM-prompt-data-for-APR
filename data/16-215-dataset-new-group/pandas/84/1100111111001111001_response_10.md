The issue with the buggy function lies in how it handles MultiIndex objects and unstacking. The logic for handling the unstacking process seems incorrect. 

The bug causes the unstacked DataFrame to have incorrect index and column names, as well as wrong values.

To fix the bug, the unstacking logic needs to be revised to properly handle MultiIndex objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert clocs to a list of integers representing the levels to unstack
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected function, the provided test cases should pass.
