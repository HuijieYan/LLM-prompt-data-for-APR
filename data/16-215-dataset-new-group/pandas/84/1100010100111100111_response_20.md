The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is located in the code block:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

This is where the ValueError and KeyError exceptions are raised due to the wrong indexing when using tuples for the clocs input parameter.

The cause of the bug is that clocs is a tuple of level names instead of level numbers, and the `_get_level_number` method expects level numbers as input. This leads to ValueError: 'A' is not in list and KeyError: 'Level A not found' exceptions when trying to process the input.

To fix the bug, we can create a new list comprehension to get the level numbers from the level names in the `clocs` tuple using the dataframe's index. The corrected line would look like this:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(level_name) for level_name in clocs]
```

This change will ensure that the function processes the level names correctly and avoids raising the ValueError and KeyError exceptions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level_name) for level_name in clocs]

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By implementing this fix, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle the clocs input parameter correctly and avoid the ValueError and KeyError exceptions when running unstack operations on MultiIndexed dataframes with tuple names.

This should address the issue reported in the mentioned GitHub post.
