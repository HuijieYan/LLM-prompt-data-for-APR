The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be caused by improper handling of multi-index columns. In particular, the bug seems to be related to incorrectly reconstructing the multi-index columns after unstacking the data.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to revisit how the new columns are constructed after unstacking the data. It seems that the issue is related to the way the function handles multi-index columns, and there might be discrepancies between the actual column structure and the reconstructed one.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify the columns in the index
    index_cols = [col for col in data.index.names]

    # Unstack the data
    unstacked_data = data.unstack(clocs)
    
    # Fix the level name if multiple levels
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple) and len(clocs) > 1:
        unstacked_data.columns = unstacked_data.columns.set_names(clocs, level=[i for i in range(len(clocs))])

    # Return the unstacked data
    return unstacked_data
```

This corrected version should properly unstack the multi-index columns, addressing the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test cases provided.
