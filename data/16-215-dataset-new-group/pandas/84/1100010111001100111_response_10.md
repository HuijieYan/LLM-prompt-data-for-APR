### Issues in the Buggy Function

1. The function is written for handling hierarchical columns, but the comments indicate that it doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet.
2. The function is intended to unstack multi-index column data, but it attempts to return the original data if the number of column locations is zero. This doesn't handle the unstacking correctly in all scenarios.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug causes issues for unstacked multi-indexed data where universal column or level names are used, as indicated by the failing test cases and the GitHub issue. The `clocs` specifically handles the column levels and their respective names.

### Bug Fix Strategy

1. For each failing test case, ensure that the data is unstacked and reformatted according to the unstacked data's structure and index.
2. Modify the handling of hierarchical columns if the function is intended to handle them, or clarify that it does not support these cases.

### Corrected Implementation

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    stackable_series = None
    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
        stackable_series = True
    else:
        levels = rlevels + [obs_ids]
        codes = rcodes + [comp_ids]
        names = rnames + ["__placeholder__"]
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=levels,
            codes=codes,
            names=names,
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    if stackable_series:
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=[unstacked.index.levels[0]] + clevels,
            codes=[unstacked.index.codes[0]] + recons_codes,
            names=[unstacked.index.names[0]] + cnames,
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstacked.index = new_columns
        else:
            unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected implementation, the function now handles multi-index unstacking more uniformly and ensures that the newly unstacked DataFrame or Series is correctly re-indexed and reformatted.

This corrected implementation should resolve the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
