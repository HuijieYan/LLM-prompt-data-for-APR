To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, we need to correct the part of the code where the clocs list is processed. The error message indicates that the `_get_level_number` method fails to find one of the levels from the MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError. 

The fix involves modifying the code to properly handle the clocs list and avoid the KeyError. The correct level numbers need to be fetched from the index.levels and index.names attributes. After updating the level numbers in clocs, the rest of the code should handle the index construction and manipulation properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Get the level numbers by comparing names
    clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected approach fetches the level numbers from the index.names attribute by comparing the names in the clocs list. This should resolve the issue and enable the function to run without KeyErrors. All other parts of the function are retained without changes.

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now be able to handle the MultiIndex correctly and pass the failing tests.
