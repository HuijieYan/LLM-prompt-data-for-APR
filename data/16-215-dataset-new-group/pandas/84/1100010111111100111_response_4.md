The cause of the bug is in the function `_unstack_multiple`. The bug occurs when the `clocs` parameter is passed with a tuple value such as `('A', 'a')`. This triggers an error when the function attempts to get the level number as it only works with integers, not strings. This causes a `ValueError` because the string values do not exist in the list, followed by a `KeyError` indicating that the level is not found.

The bug is notably reproducible with the GitHub issue titled "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError". The test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` fails to unstack a DataFrame with a MultiIndex with tuple names, triggering the `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to handle individual levels and tuple names correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    levels_list = [t if isinstance(t, tuple) else (t,) for t in clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in levels_list]

    # ... rest of the original function code
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple and properly set up the `levels_list` to be a list of tuples, accounting for individual levels and tuple names. The function then proceeds with the rest of the code as before.

This corrected function should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and allow the failing tests to pass.
