The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be due to the incorrect creation and manipulation of indexes and columns. The function is trying to unstack the data based on specific column levels, but the process is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle the creation of new indexes and columns, and make sure that they are updated correctly based on the unstacked data.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the data
    index = data.index

    # Get the positions of the specified levels and the remaining levels
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # If there are no remaining levels, return data
    if not rlocs:
        return data

    # Initialize lists to store the levels, codes, and names for the remaining and specified levels
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Get the shape of the specified level codes
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    # Calculate the group index, compressed ids, and reconstructed codes
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Create a dummy index based on the remaining levels
    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    # Conditionally unstack the data based on its type
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # If the data is a Series, unstack it and update the levels, names, and codes
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        # If the data is not a Series, perform the unstacking operation element-wise for each specified level
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    # Create new columns based on the unstacked data
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    # Update the index or columns of the unstacked data based on its type
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function handles the unstacking operation based on the specified column levels and also updates the indexes and columns properly according to the type of the data. The corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values provided for all the test cases.
