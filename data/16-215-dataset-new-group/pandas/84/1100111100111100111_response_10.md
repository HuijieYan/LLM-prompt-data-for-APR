The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function has been identified in response to three runtime cases. The issue arises from the attempt to retrieve the level numbers from a MultiIndex when the level names are tuples, such as `('A', 'a')`. When the `_get_level_number` method is used, it results in a `ValueError` when the level name is not found in the list of level names.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly. One potential strategy to fix this bug is to modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle MultiIndex with tuple names and return the appropriate level number.

Here is a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged from the original)

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected code, the condition `if isinstance(i, tuple)` is added to check if the element in `clocs` is a tuple, and if so, `index._get_level_number(i)` is called. This will ensure that when the level names are tuples, the level numbers can be retrieved correctly.

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle MultiIndex with tuple names and pass the failing tests mentioned in the GitHub issue.
