The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack hierarchical data using multiple column locations. The bug appears to be related to handling hierarchical columns and may result in incorrect unstacking and malformed indexes.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Inadequate handling of hierarchical columns.
2. Incorrect reconstruction of codes.
3. Mismatched shapes and indices in the data unstacking process.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly reconstructing the unstacked data and is not handling hierarchical columns properly, leading to potential index mismatches and incorrect unstacking of the data.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Properly handle hierarchical columns by maintaining their structure during unstacking.
2. Ensure that the code reconstruction is accurate and aligned with the unstacked data.
3. Verify the integrity of the indices and shapes during the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the function focuses on preserving the integrity of the data index and appropriately handling hierarchical columns during the unstacking process.
