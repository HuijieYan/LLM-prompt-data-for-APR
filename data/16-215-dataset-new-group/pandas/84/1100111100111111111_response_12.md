Following the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, we can see that the issue is caused by the `_get_level_number` method of the `index` variable. The error messages indicate that the method is unable to find the specified level when it's represented as a tuple, leading to a `KeyError` in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The `_get_level_number` method is expected to handle multi-level indexing when passed a tuple of level names, but it seems to be misinterpreting the names, leading to the KeyError. The other methods used in the function, such as `group_index` and the creation of new indices and columns, seem to be fine.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` method should be modified to correctly handle the provided inputs. It should properly check for the existence of the specified levels when represented as tuples.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_level_number` method and the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if count > 1 and not isinstance(level, int):
        raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        if not isinstance(level, int):
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
    return level

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Rest of the implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

With the above changes, the `_get_level_number` method will now handle the input correctly and provide a successful return of the level number. And the `_unstack_multiple` function can continue with the other calculations and unstacking logic as before.

This fix should resolve the bug and make the unstacking operation work correctly with tuple names in multi-index data, as indicated in the provided failing test.
