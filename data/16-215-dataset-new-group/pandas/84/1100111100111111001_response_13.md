The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function appears to be related to the `clocs` variable, which is a list of column locations. The error occurs when attempting to retrieve the level number for the columns, resulting in a `ValueError` or `KeyError` due to level names not being found in the index.

It seems that the issue arises from `clocs` being a tuple of tuples in the failing test cases, whereas the function expects it to be a list. This leads to errors when trying to get the level numbers from the index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `clocs` is properly handled as a list, and that the correct level information is retrieved from the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in list(clocs)]  # Ensure clocs is a list

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `clocs` input will be properly handled as a list, ensuring that the level numbers are retrieved correctly from the index, and the errors encountered in the failing test cases should be resolved.
