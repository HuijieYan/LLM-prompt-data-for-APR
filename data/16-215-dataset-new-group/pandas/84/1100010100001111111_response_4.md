## Bug analysis

The core issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it fails to handle the case where the columns to unstack are provided as a tuple in MultiIndex form. The function currently breaks when encountering this scenario, leading to a KeyError. This failure prevents the function from correctly unstacking the input data, causing it to return unexpected results.

## Identified bug locations
- The `clocs` variable needs to be transformed to level numbers at the beginning of the function, but the current implementation fails to handle the scenario where the input is a tuple in MultiIndex form.
- The subsequent part of the function generates a `dummy_index` and `dummy` DataFrame or Series, then attempts to unstack it based on the '__placeholder__' column. However, the handling for hierarchical columns in this context is not appropriate, leading to issues when input data contains MultiIndex column levels.

## Bug cause
The bug arises because the current implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function does not properly handle the scenario where the columns to be unstacked are presented as a tuple in MultiIndex form. This leads to a failure when the function tries to transform the column location tuple into level numbers.

## Bug fix strategy
To resolve this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function must be updated to handle the scenario of MultiIndex column levels correctly. The function needs to transform the input column location tuples to level numbers and then perform unstacking based on these levels in a way that properly considers hierarchical columns.

## Corrected `_unstack_multiple` function

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to level numbers if required
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple) and all(isinstance(loc, tuple) for loc in clocs):
        clocs = tuple(data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs)
    else:
        clocs = tuple([data.index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs])

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the columns to be unstacked are in MultiIndex form. If so, it transforms them into level numbers appropriately. This modification ensures that the function can handle MultiIndex column levels correctly, resolving the KeyError issue.
