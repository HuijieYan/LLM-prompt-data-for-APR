The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be failing when it tries to obtain the level number of a multilevel index using the names of the levels passed as input. The function then uses the obtained level numbers to perform further operations, such as compression, deconstruction, and unstacking. However, it seems that the function is not correctly handling tuple names for levels in multi-indexes, leading to the KeyError and ValueError exceptions seen in the failing tests.

The issue on GitHub further confirms the problem, with the unstack operation failing with a KeyError and ValueError when trying to unstack a multi-index series with tuple names for levels.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function would be to handle tuple names properly when obtaining the level numbers. The function should identify whether the name is a single level name or a tuple of names representing a multi-level index and obtain the level number accordingly. It should also handle other operations, such as compression, deconstruction, and unstacking, based on the proper handling of multi-level indexes with tuple names as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple) and all(isinstance(item, str) for item in clocs):
        cloc_indices = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_indices = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]

    rloc_indices = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]

    # Rest of the function code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected version of the function should check whether the input clocs is a tuple of strings and accordingly obtain level numbers. After that, the remaining code for compression, deconstruction, and unstacking should continue as before. This correction should handle multi-level indexes with tuple names properly to avoid the KeyError and ValueError exceptions seen in the failing tests and the related GitHub issue.
