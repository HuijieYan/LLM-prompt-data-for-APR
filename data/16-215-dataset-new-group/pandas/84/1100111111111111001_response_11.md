The cause of the bug is that the `_get_level_number` function is being passed a tuple as an argument, which it doesn't handle properly. The `clocs` variable, which represents column locations, is being defined incorrectly, which leads to errors further in the function. Additionally, the MultiIndex structure is not being preserved correctly when unstacking the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column locations are properly handled, and that the structure of the MultiIndex is preserved when unstacking the DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]

    # Handling hierarchical columns
    index = data.index
    clevels = [index.levels[index.names.index(loc)] for loc in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[index.names.index(loc)] for loc in clocs]
    rest = [loc for loc in index.names if loc not in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)
    
    # Reconstruct new index with proper MultiIndex structure
    if len(rest) == 0:
        new_index = unstacked.index
    else:
        rest_levels = [index.levels[index.names.index(loc)] for loc in rest]
        rest_codes = [index.codes[index.names.index(loc)] for loc in rest]
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(rest_levels, names=rest)
        new_index = dummy_index.insert(list(range(len(rest))), unstacked.index)

    unstacked.index = new_index
    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the `clocs` variable can be either a tuple or a list. We then use the provided columns and levels to properly unstack the DataFrame. We construct a new index that preserves the MultiIndex structure of the original DataFrame after unstacking.

With these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now handle MultiIndex unstacking properly and pass the failing tests.
