From the error messages and the runtime values, it appears that the main issue lies in the `_get_level_number` method that is called within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the 'A' level is not found. This error occurs when the name 'A' can't be found in the `MultiIndex` during an unstack operation. 

To fix this issue, you can modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case of a tuple name in the `MultiIndex` when performing the unstack operation. Instead of directly calling the `_get_level_number` method, the function can extract the level names from the tuple and handle the unstacking accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple
        clocs = [clocs]  # Convert clocs to a list containing the tuple
    else:
        if len(clocs) == 1 and isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):  # Check if clocs contains a single tuple
            clocs = clocs[0]  # Assign the tuple to clocs

    # Updated code to handle unstacking with tuple names in MultiIndex
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the existing code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

With this modification, the function checks if the `clocs` parameter is a tuple and handles the unstacking operation accordingly. This update should resolve the KeyError caused by the unstacking operation with tuple names in the `MultiIndex`.

Once this function is updated, you can re-run the failing test cases to ensure that the bug is fixed and the unstacking operation with tuple names in the `MultiIndex` produces the expected output.

This solution addresses the issue and provides a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function to resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
