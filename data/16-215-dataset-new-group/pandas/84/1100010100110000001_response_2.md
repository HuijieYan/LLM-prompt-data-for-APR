The error message is indicating that the function is trying to use a level that does not exist. This is likely due to a reference to the levels of the index that is incorrect or does not exist.

Upon analyzing the function, the issue here seems to be that the `names` attribute of the index is a list of tuples, but the function is treating it as a list of strings.

The cause of the bug is that the `names` attribute of the index is being treated as a list of strings when it is actually a list of tuples. The function is unable to find the level specified due to this mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct levels are extracted from the `names` attribute of the index and handled appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    levels = [name[1] for name in index.names]  # Extracting the correct levels

    clocs = [levels.index(i) for i in clocs]  # Get the index of the level in the list of levels

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # ... [rest of the function remains the same]
```

By extracting the correct levels from the `names` attribute and using those to find the indices of the levels, we ensure that the function correctly deals with hierarchical indices and does not raise errors when accessing non-existent levels.
