The bug arises from the `_get_level_number` function within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the function is trying to find a level that is not in the list of names. This occurs when dealing with levels in MultiIndex that includes tuples as names. 

The issue appears to be in the implementation of the attempt to extract the level number from the index. The method `_get_level_number` is failing because it's not handling the specific case of MultiIndex with tuples as names correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to improve the way the level number is extracted. This can be done by checking if the level being sought is a tuple or a single value. If it's a tuple, then the correct level to be obtained is the first element of the tuple, and if it's a single value then it can proceed as before. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i[0]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function body remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, the `_get_level_number` function is now able to handle both single values and tuples as names, allowing it to extract the level number correctly.

With this fix in place, the failing tests should now pass without raising the KeyError or ValueError errors.
