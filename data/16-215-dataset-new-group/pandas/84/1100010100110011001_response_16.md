## Code Analysis
The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` method is being used incorrectly. The error message states that `'A' is not in list`, indicating that the code is trying to find the letter 'A' in a list, which results in a `ValueError` because 'A' is not in the list of level names.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to how the level is being handled, and it's resulting in an attempt to find a string in a list of tuples instead of an integer level number. To fix this, we need to ensure that the level is properly determined as an integer level number before using it to retrieve level information.

To fix the bug, we need to change how the level is handled when passing it to the `_get_level_number` method.

## The corrected function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
  
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected function, I added a condition to check if the `clocs` element is an integer. If not, it is passed to the `_get_level_number` method to retrieve the proper integer level number. If the element is already an integer, it is used as-is. This should resolve the issue by ensuring that the correct level number is retrieved before further processing.
