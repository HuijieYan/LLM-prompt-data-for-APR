The issue seems to be occurring in the `_get_level_number` function, which is causing a `KeyError` with the error message `'Level A not found'`. This error is propagated from the `unstack` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` source file.

The `unstack` operation fails when trying to transform a `MultiIndex` with tuple names. This task is handled through the internal `_unstack_multiple` function in the `reshape.py` source file, which is also failing.

From the runtime variable values of the failing cases, it seems the issue is caused by the incorrect use of `index._get_level_number(i)` within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The index is a `MultiIndex`, and it appears that passing a tuple of levels to the `_get_level_number` is causing the failure.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly handle `MultiIndex` with tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = []
    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            level_loc = index.names.index(loc)
            level_numbers.append(level_loc)
        else:
            level_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(loc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # ... (rest of the code)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the function checks if each `clocs` element is a tuple and uses `index.names.index(loc)` to get the level number in that case. Otherwise, it uses `index._get_level_number(loc)` as before.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and handle the unstacking operation for multi-indexes with tuple names.
