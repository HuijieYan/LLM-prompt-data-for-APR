The issue is caused by the `_get_level_number` method, where the `level` parameter is checked against `self.names` and it's raising a ValueError or KeyError. This happens because the level parameter is a tuple instead of a single element, causing the lookup to fail.

A strategy to fix this bug is to check if the level parameter is a tuple, and if so, iterate over the elements and perform the lookup individually for each element.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            cloc = tuple(index._get_level_number(level) for level in cloc)
        else:
            cloc = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        cloc_numbers.append(cloc)

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function should be able to handle both single-level and multi-level column selection correctly.
