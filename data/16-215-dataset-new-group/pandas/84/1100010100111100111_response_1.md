The issue with the function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be related to the incorrect handling of multi-level indexes. The error messages indicate that the function is trying to find the level number of the index, and it is failing to do so because of the way the level is being accessed and processed.

Upon analyzing the different runtime values and types in the buggy function, it's clear that there are discrepancies in the way the names and levels of the multi-index are being handled, leading to errors when attempting to perform the unstack operation.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves:
1. Correctly getting the level number for each level designation in the index.
2. Updating the processing of levels, names, and codes to align with the index structure.
3. Ensuring the unstacked index and columns are built correctly for different types of input.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) if not isinstance(level, int) else level for level in clocs]

    unpivoted = data.copy()
    for level in level_numbers:
        unpivoted = unpivoted.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unpivoted
```

Using this corrected function, the unstacked data should now be created correctly, and it should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posed in the GitHub context described above.
