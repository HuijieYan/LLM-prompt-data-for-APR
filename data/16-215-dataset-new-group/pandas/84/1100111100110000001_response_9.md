1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` takes in the input data, column locations (`clocs`), and a fill value. It then attempts to modify and unstack the data based on the column locations and then reshapes the index and columns after unstacking. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with getting the level number from the index.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function include the section where the level numbers are obtained from the index and used in further manipulations (`clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`).

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the mismatch between the level names provided and the actual level names in the index. This leads to the error messages indicating that the level or name is not found.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to verify that the level names provided in the input correspond to the actual level names in the index before attempting to obtain the level numbers. Additionally, robust error handling can be added to handle the cases where the level names are not found in the index.

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index
    
    levels = index.names
    clocs = [levels.index(i) if i in levels else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we first obtain the level numbers for the provided level names and then proceed with the rest of the function. This approach ensures that the correct level numbers are used in further manipulations. Additionally, it avoids using the level names directly, which could result in errors if the provided level names are not found in the index.
