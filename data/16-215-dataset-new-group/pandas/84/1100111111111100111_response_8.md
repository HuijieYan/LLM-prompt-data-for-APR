The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` has several issues, as demonstrated by the failing test cases and the GitHub issue. The main issue arises from the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, which calls the `_get_level_number` method of the `index` object on each element of `clocs`. This method is responsible for mapping level names to level numbers, but it does not handle the case where the level is a tuple.

The code fails to handle hierarchical columns and fails to produce the correct results in cases where the number of levels is greater than one. The root cause of the issue is that the function `_get_level_number` does not properly handle MultiIndex names. It raises a KeyError with the message "Level A not found" because it expects a single name, not a tuple of names.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to properly handle MultiIndex names and ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly for MultiIndex objects with tuple names.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):

        # Convert the list of tuples to a single tuple if there is only one level
        if len(clocs) == 1:
            clocs = clocs[0]
        
        clocs = index.get_loc(clocs)  # Use get_loc method to handle tuple names

    result = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return result
```

In the corrected version:
- For MultiIndex objects, the `get_loc` method is used with the `clocs` parameter to correctly handle the case where `clocs` is a tuple of names.

This correction should resolve the KeyError that occurs when unstacking MultiIndex objects with tuple names and ensure that the function works correctly for all relevant cases.

After applying this fix, the `unstack` method should work correctly for MultiIndex objects with tuple names, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
