## Bug in the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is intended to unstack a MultiIndexed DataFrame or Series and maintain the integrity of its index. However, it contains a flaw when trying to handle the unstacking of a MultiIndexed DataFrame or Series with a tuple name, which leads to uncaught exceptions and incorrect results.

The issue primarily lies in the section where the function is attempting to process the input `clocs` which contain a combination of tuples and indices. The function is not properly handling the case when `clocs` include tuple names like `("A", "a")`, and this leads to an error when it tries to extract the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`.

## Suggested Bug Fix

To address this bug:
1. Identify and handle the case when `clocs` contains tuple names to properly extract the level number.
2. Modify the logic for processing the `clocs` list to ensure that it can handle both individual index values and tuple names correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract level numbers for both individual indices and tuple names
    index = data.index
    cloc_levels = [index._get_level_number(c) if not isinstance(c, tuple) else index.names.index(c) for c in clocs]

    # Other existing code and logic remains unchanged
    
    return unstacked
```

By updating the code to correctly handle the extraction of level numbers for both individual indices and tuple names, the corrected version of the function should be able to handle the Unstack operation properly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and address the underlying bug in the function.
