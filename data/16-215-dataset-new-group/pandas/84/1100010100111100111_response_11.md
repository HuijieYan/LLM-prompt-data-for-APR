The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing a ValueError and a KeyError when it tries to get the level number of an index. The issue is related to unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The creation and assignment of `dummy_index` and `group_index`.
2. The computation and assignment of `recons_codes`.
3. The conditions within the `if/else` blocks for returning the result.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the `clocs` list. The main issue is that `clocs` is getting misinterpreted as a single level index when it should be treated as multiple levels. This causes the program to raise a KeyError because it fails to find the level that it expects in the index.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly handle the scenario where `clocs` contains multiple level indices. This involves modifying the logic around the `clocs` variable and its use within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index
import numpy as np

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(item, (list, tuple)) for item in clocs):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(item) for item in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged up to the return statements
    # (No need to modify the rest of the function)
```

The main change in the corrected version is the modification of how the `clocs` list is handled. It now properly distinguishes between a single level index and multiple level indices and processes them accordingly. This should resolve the issue and make the function handle MultiIndex unstacking, especially for cases involving tuple names.
