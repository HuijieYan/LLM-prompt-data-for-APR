The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` in the original source code is caused by the use of `index._get_level_number(i)` to identify the level numbers for the columns. This may result in KeyError 'Level A not found' when multiple levels are present in the columns. The code attempts to unstack a multi-index and fails to unstack successfully, resulting in an error.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to use the column values explicitly for the unstack operation and handle multi-level indices. The corrected version should address handling multi-level indices during unstacking.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    column_names = index.names

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index.names.index(c) for c in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    if len(clocs) == 1:
        stacked_levels = index.levels[clocs[0]]
    else:
        stacked_levels = [index.levels[c] for c in clocs]

    unstacked.index = unstacked.index.reorder_levels(column_names)
    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(stacked_levels, names=column_names)
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
With this corrected version, the unstacking operation will be based on the column names (clocs) provided, and it will properly handle the multi-level indices, preventing any KeyError issues.
