The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` results in errors when attempting to unstack multi-indexed data. The `index` variable is a multi-index object that tries to get the level number for each level name in the `clocs` variable, which contains the names of levels to be unstacked. The unstacking process is convoluted and prone to errors, especially when dealing with multi-indexes. The failing test functions indicate the cause of the bug as it pertains to an inconsistency in dealing with multi-indexes.

In the first failing test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex`, the function fails with a ValueError and a KeyError related to the handling of multi-indexes. The error message states that a particular level is not found in the list of index names, thereby leading to an error.

In the second failing test function `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex`, the function also fails with similar errors relating to the inconsistency in handling levels and names within the multi-index, resulting in a ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be refactored to use a simpler, more robust method for unstacking multi-indexed data.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs into a list to make sure it is a list of tuples
    clocs = [clocs] if isinstance(clocs, tuple) else list(clocs)

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data.copy()
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
        return result

    return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
```

With this correction, the function will be able to handle unstacking of multi-indexed data correctly and should pass both failing test cases.
