Based on the given expected values and types of variables, it seems that the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to handle multi-index DataFrame unstacking and reconstruction. The bug might be related to incorrect variable manipulations or type assignments.

The potential errors found in the function are:
1. There is a redundant loop for unstacking when `data.columns` is a MultiIndex, leading to potential faulty results.
2. Incorrect variable assignment and manipulation, possibly leading to incorrect reconstruction of new columns and indices.
3. Improper type handling with potential faulty conversions that impact the final data structure and output.

To fix the bug, we should:
1. Investigate the data structure of the input DataFrame and properly handle the unstacking process based on whether the columns are a MultiIndex or not.
2. Ensure correct variable assignments and manipulations throughout the unstacking and reconstruction process to generate the expected output.
3. Properly handle type conversions and maintain the data structure integrity during the process.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Check if data.columns is a MultiIndex
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result
    else:
        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

        clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
        ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
        cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
        rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
        rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
        rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

        shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
        group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

        comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
        recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

        # Handling the case where rlocs is an empty list
        if rlocs == []:
            dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
        else:
            dummy_index = MultiIndex(
                levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
                codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
                names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
                verify_integrity=True,
            )

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    
        if isinstance(data, Series):
            new_levels = clevels
            new_names = cnames
            new_codes = recons_codes
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.index if isinstance(unstacked, Series) else unstacked.columns
            new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
            new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames
            new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
            for rec in recons_codes:
                new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=True
        )

        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstacked.index = new_columns
        else:
            unstacked.columns = new_columns

        return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we properly check the type of `data.columns` and handle the unstacking process accordingly. We also ensure correct variable assignments and manipulations to reconstruct the new columns and indices. Additionally, we maintain the integrity of the data structure by properly handling type conversions and ensuring the correct data structure at different stages of the process.
