The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is caused by an issue in the way the `clocs` parameter is being processed. The code attempts to convert the level names to their corresponding level number using the `index._get_level_number(i)` method. This is done using a list comprehension which results in the error.

The issue occurs when trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names using the `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` method along with the `('A', 'a')` tuple, signaling a KeyError in the underlying `_unstack_multiple` function due to the processing of `clocs`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the approach for handling the `clocs` parameter. The MultiIndex should not be processed using only the level names but should also consider the level numbers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cnums = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cnums]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cnums]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cnums]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cnums]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected version, the `clocs` parameter is checked for tuple names or level numbers, and then `cnums` is created to store the appropriate level indices. This addresses the issue and the function now handles the `clocs` parameter correctly.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the failing test cases should pass.
