The cause of the bug is that the function `_unstack_multiple` is intended for unstacking MultiIndex data, but it did not properly handle the case where the levels being unstacked are represented using tuples of names. 

Based on the GitHub issue, the failing test cases and their input parameters provided, it's clear that the function is not working as intended. It does not handle input parameters involving tuple names in the MultiIndex data.

To fix the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function, the following strategy can be employed:
- Modify the function so that it can handle the scenario where the levels being unstacked are represented using tuples of names. 
- Use conditional checks to handle the specific case of tuple naming, instead of indexing directly with integer values, as in `index._get_level_number(i)`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    # Handle the case where the levels being unstacked are represented using tuples of names
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By adding conditional handling for tuple naming and checking if `clocs` is a tuple, this approach ensures that the function will properly handle either scenario. It also provides adequate backward compatibility for cases where the input `clocs` might not be a tuple and need to be handled using the old behavior.
