In this buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, there is an issue of unchecked index levels for MultiIndex. The issue reported on GitHub is a KeyError when an attempt is made to unstack with tuple names fails. The GitHub user has reported using the `unstack` method on a Series with a MultiIndex and specified the levels to unstack, but it results in a KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that when attempting to get the level number from the index using the `index._get_level_number(i)`, the function does not handle the tuple names correctly. This results in a KeyError when trying to access levels of MultiIndex. The root cause of this issue is inadequate handling of hierarchical columns in MultiIndex. 

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the code correctly handles hierarchical columns in the MultiIndex, including tuples with names. One possible approach is to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to account for nested levels of the MultiIndex, so that it correctly obtains codes and levels for stacking and unstacking.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in getattr(index, 'names', []) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
}
```

In the updated version, the modified line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in getattr(index, 'names', []) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]` ensures that correct level numbers are obtained, handling the case where the names of a MultiIndex may be tuples. This modification addresses the issue of KeyError when attempting to unstack using tuple names.
