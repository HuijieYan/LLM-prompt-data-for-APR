The bug in the provided function `_unstack_multiple` appears to be causing issues with unstacking MultiIndexed Series with tuple names. 

The bug seems to be related to the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The `clocs` are being used to retrieve levels from the index. However, in the GitHub issue, it is reported that `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` is being raised, which indicates an issue with extracting the level number based on the level name.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we are properly handling the case of getting the level number from the name in a MultiIndex with tuple names.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cnames = [c if isinstance(c, tuple) else (None, c) for c in clocs]

    cnums = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in cnames]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cnums]

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version, we are first converting the names in `clocs` to tuples if they are not already tuples. Then, we are using `index._get_level_number` to get the level number based on the name. This change should address the KeyError issue related to unstacking MultiIndexed Series with tuple names.
