The bug arises from the function `_get_level_number` being called with a string input `level` instead of a tuple. This occurs because `level` is intended to represent one or more level names in MultiIndex, but it is being processed as a single value, resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_level_number` needs to be updated to handle both single and multiple-level naming in MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle multiple level names
    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    # Find the corresponding levels for the specified names
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...

    return unstacked
```

By handling the case of both single and multiple level names in `clocs`, the function will avoid the errors encountered in the failing tests.
