The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is used to unstack a DataFrame or Series based on the given level (or levels) of the MultiIndex. The error message shows that the function is failing while trying to identify the level number using `index._get_level_number` and hence causing a KeyError.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. The error could be stemming from `index._get_level_number(i)` where the function tries to get the level number based on the input `i`.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The function `index._get_level_number(i)` is throwing a KeyError because the input `i` doesn't match any level in the MultiIndex.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that the input `i` in `clocs` is a valid level in the MultiIndex before calling the `_get_level_number` method.

#### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Note: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [loc for loc in clocs if loc in index.names]

    rlocs = [loc for loc in index.names if loc not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code can remain the same
    ...
```

This solution ensures that only valid level names from `clocs` are kept, and the rest of the code can proceed as it was. This should prevent the KeyError that was observed previously.
