The function `_unstack_multiple` has several bugs that need to be fixed. It currently fails on multiple tests with errors ranging from ValueError to KeyError. The primary issue seems to stem from an incorrect indexing operation when using the `index._get_level_number` method, where it raises an error for "not found" instead of "is not in list." The key error is raised for "Level A not found."

To fix this bug:
- The issue appears to be in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` where `i` is not being found in `index.names`.
- The cause of the bug is that this line expects the `clocs` to be a list of level names from the index, but it seems `clocs` should be a list of tuples where each tuple represents a level's name. Instead, we can modify the function to derive the level names from the `data` provided.
- We have to modify how `clocs` is derived and utilized throughout the code. We also need to adjust the subsequent operations based on the level names rather than directly using the level numbers extracted from `index._get_level_number(i)`.

Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import required classes and functions
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series
from pandas.core.sorting import compress_group_index, decons_obs_group_ids, get_compressed_ids, get_group_index

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the data
    index = data.index

    # Derive the level names from the data columns
    clevels = [data.columns.names[i] for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.unstack(level=clevels, fill_value=fill_value)
        return dummy

    unstacked = data.copy()
    for i in range(len(clocs)):
        unstacked = unstacked.unstack(level=clevels[i], fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to handle unstacking operations of multiple levels correctly and pass the failing test, as well as other similar use-cases.
