## Correction

The issue stems from the `_get_level_number()` method, which is used to retrieve the level number for each column name provided in `clocs`. Since the `MultiIndex` is not correctly handling tuple names, the bug can be resolved by ensuring that the function can handle hierarchical or multi-level column names.

A strategy to fix this bug would be to update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle hierarchical or multi-level column names and call the `unstack()` method only for the single level in the case of hierarchical columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Identify if hierarchical columns are present
    if not any(isinstance(item, tuple) for item in data.columns):
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # The following code handles hierarchical columns
    level = clocs[0]
    unstacked = data.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the function will first check for the presence of hierarchical columns and unstack the specified level accordingly.

This change ensures that the code correctly handles both single-level and multi-level column naming, resolving the issue related to unstacking with tuple names in hierarchical columns.
