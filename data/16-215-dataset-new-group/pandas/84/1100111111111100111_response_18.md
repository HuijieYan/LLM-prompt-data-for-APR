The issue in the `_get_level_number` function is caused by TypeError with a string variable. It's attempting to treat the string as an integer. This error in the `_unstack_multiple` function on line 317 is due to an attempt to access level names as an integer, which leads to an error. 

To fix the bug, handle the case where the input to `_get_level_number` may be either a tuple or an integer, and use the appropriate method to extract the level number. Update the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly process the tuple format for multi-index and avoid the key error.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # Handle input as both a tuple or an index level integer
    cloc_numbers = []
    for i in clocs:
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(i))
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(i)

    clocs = cloc_numbers

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

The changes made to the `_unstack_multiple` function will resolve the issue raised in the GitHub. The new function handles both tuple and integer inputs correctly to access the level number.

I hope this helps to fix the bug and addresses the GitHub issue.
