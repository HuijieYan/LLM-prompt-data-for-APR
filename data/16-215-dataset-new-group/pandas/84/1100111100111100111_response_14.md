The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` arises from the method `_get_level_number` of the `MultiIndex` class. The `_get_level_number` method attempts to match the input level to the levels in the `MultiIndex`. However, in some cases, the method fails to find the level and raises a `KeyError`. 

This is caused due to the nature of the inputs passed to the `_unstack_multiple` function. The variable `clocs` is supposed to contain level values, but in the failing cases, the variable `clocs` holds incorrect values such as tuples, which are not valid levels in the `MultiIndex`.

A strategy for fixing the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is to correctly handle the level types in the input `clocs`. If a tuple is provided, it needs to be extracted into individual level values. Then, the extracted level values should be used to perform any further operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [(c,) if not isinstance(c, tuple) else c for c in clocs]  # Extract individual levels from tuples

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # The rest of the function is unchanged
```

In the corrected version, the `clocs` list is modified before being used to match the levels in the `MultiIndex`. Each tuple in `clocs` is converted to individual elements before being processed. This ensures that the levels are correctly extracted and used for further operations. After this modification, the function should be able to handle tuples as input for `clocs` and prevent the `KeyError` issue due to incorrect level selection.
