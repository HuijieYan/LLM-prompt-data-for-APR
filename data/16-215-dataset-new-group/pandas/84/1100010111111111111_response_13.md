The issue arises from the `_unstack_multiple` function in the pandas library. The `clocs` parameter is not being processed correctly by the function, resulting in an error when retrieving the level number from the index. This error is indicated by the KeyError: 'Level A not found'.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the `clocs` parameter within the `_unstack_multiple` function. We can see that the `clocs` parameter is used to obtain level numbers from the index, but since it is a tuple with multiple elements, it is not handled appropriately.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle the `clocs` parameter correctly. Since `clocs` represents MultiIndex level names, we need to ensure that each element of `clocs` represents a level name. Then we can retrieve the corresponding level number from the index and proceed with the unstack operation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Perform type check on clocs
    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    # Retrieve level numbers for the specified level names 
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index.get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    ...  # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `clocs` parameter and ensure that each element of the `clocs` list or tuple represents a level name, allowing the unstack operation to be performed without errors.
