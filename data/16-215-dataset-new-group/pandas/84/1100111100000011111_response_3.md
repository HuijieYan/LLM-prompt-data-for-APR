The issue arises from the unstacking of a Series with a MultiIndex that contains tuple names fails with a KeyError. It is expected that the _unstack_multiple function should handle MultiIndexes, but it doesn't. The cause of the bug is that the level value passed to the _unstack_multiple is set to be default none. There's a need to handle hierarchical columns in this buggy function.

Now, to fix this issue, the following strategy can be used:
1. Include handling for hierarchical columns in the _unstack_multiple function to resolve the bug.
2. Ensure that the levels and codes are properly manipulated to correctly reassemble the new MultiIndex after unstacking.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(result.columns.names[val], fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result
```

By including code to properly handle hierarchical columns and making necessary adjustments to the levels and codes when reassembling the MultiIndex after unstacking, the corrected function should be able to resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
