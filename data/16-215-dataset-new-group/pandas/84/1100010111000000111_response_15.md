The buggy function `_unstack_multiple()` fails to correctly unstack MultiIndex DataFrames when tuple names are involved. The test `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` in `test_reshape.py` fails due to the KeyError 'Level (A, a) not found,' as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of levels when unstacking MultiIndex DataFrames with tuple names. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct level numbers are being used and that the tuple names are processed properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index
    index = data.index

    # Get the level numbers corresponding to the clocs
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    # Get the rest of the level numbers not in clocs
    rloc_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # Get the actual levels and codes for the clocs and rlocs
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rloc_numbers]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rloc_numbers]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Create the dummy index based on the number of rlocs
    if rloc_numbers == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # Copy the data and set the dummy index
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    # Unstack the dummy data
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
  
    # Return the unstacked data
    return unstacked
```

With these modifications, the corrected `_unstack_multiple()` function should now pass the failing test and also resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Note: The full compatibility of the corrected function should be verified by running all relevant tests related to unstacking MultiIndex DataFrames, not just the failing tests mentioned.
