The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `unstack` method for multi-level indices. The error messages indicate that the function `_unstack_multiple` is not properly identifying the levels for unstacking, which leads to errors in retrieving the index levels and codes.

The strategy for fixing the bug includes:
1. Revamping the logic for identifying the levels and codes for unstacking in the function `_unstack_multiple`.
2. Handling edge cases where the multi-level indices are not being properly recognized.
3. Validating the input data to ensure that the unstacking operation is performed correctly for both Series and DataFrames.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Identify the levels based on index type
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        cnames = coerce_indexer(index, clocs)
        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    else:
        cnames = [index.names[cloc] for cloc in clocs]
        rlocs = [i for i in index.names if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.get_level_values(cname) for cname in cnames]
    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(rname) for rname in rlocs]

    # Create a dummy dataframe for unstacking
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = MultiIndex.from_product(clevels, names=cnames)

    unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value).reorder_levels(rnames, axis=1).sort_index(axis=1)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected `unstack_multiple` function improves the logic for identifying the levels and codes for unstacking, handling both Series and DataFrame inputs and properly managing multi-level indices.
