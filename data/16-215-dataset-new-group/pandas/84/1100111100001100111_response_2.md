Based on the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `_get_level_number` function is causing the KeyError. This suggests that the issue lies in the `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` line. The `clocs` values being extracted in this line of code are causing the KeyError because the code expects `i` to be an integer representing the level, but it's being passed a tuple.

Additionally, the code includes a block that's meant to handle single-level indices (`if len(clocs) == 0`), but the actual implementation appears to deal with MultiIndex only.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` to handle both single-level and multi-level indices correctly.
2. Include additional conditionals for single-level indices.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:  # Handling single-level indices
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handling MultiIndex and extracting level numbers
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]
    else:  # Handling single-level indices
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Remaining code...
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By incorporating this adjustment to handle both single-level and multi-level indices, the bug should be resolved, and the correction aligns with the details provided in the GitHub issue.
