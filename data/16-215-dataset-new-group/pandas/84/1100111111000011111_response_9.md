The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from the incorrect behavior of getting the level number. This is causing a key error when trying to index items at that level. The `clocs` parameter is used to identify the levels to unstack and is incorrectly calculated. 

Here are some proposed changes to address the issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function:
1. Update the calculation for `clocs` to directly use the levels from the multi-index and check for the specified tuples in the levels. 
2. Update the `clocs` list based on the index levels rather than using the `.index` method directly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    levels = data.index.levels
    cloc_levels = [level for level in levels if level.names == clocs]

    clocs = [levels.index(level) for level in cloc_levels]

    # rest of the original code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we retrieve the levels of the index and check for the specified tuples in the levels, adjusting the `clocs` list accordingly. This should address the KeyError issue that arises when using tuple names in a multi-index and attempting to unstack.
