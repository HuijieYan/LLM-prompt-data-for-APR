The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the column indices when unstacking a DataFrame or Series. 

The strategy to fix the bug would involve:
- Identifying the correct way to handle the unstacking process for hierarchical columns.
- Checking the types and structures of the input data, and ensuring the appropriate methods are called based on the data type.

Here's the corrected and refactored version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    columns = data.columns

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This refactored version simplifies the unstacking logic and appropriately handles both Series and DataFrame inputs, ensuring that the unstacking process is consistent with the input data type.
