The issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to how it attempts to handle hierarchical columns. The function accesses the levels, codes, and names of the index to perform transformations. However, it appears that the function does not handle MultiIndex columns appropriately.

Looking at the provided buggy function and the failing test cases, we can see that the function fails to operate correctly when `clocs` is a tuple, specifically when `clocs` includes a MultiIndex column.

The bug arises from the `if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):` condition, where it attempts to directly unstack the columns. This seems to cause issues when dealing with MultiIndex columns, leading to the KeyError and ValueError exceptions.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles MultiIndex columns appropriately and correctly applies the unstacking operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        # Handle MultiIndex columns
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.columns = dummy.columns.reorder_levels(clocs)
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [unstcols.names[0]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, we handle MultiIndex columns by reordering the levels and performing the unstacking operation appropriately based on the column structure.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
