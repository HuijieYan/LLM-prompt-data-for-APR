The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely due to improper handling of the input parameters and data processing steps. The function seems to contain complex logic to handle multi-level indexing, and the bug might be caused by incorrect manipulation of the index and data structures.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be revised to ensure that the index manipulation and unstacking operations are performed correctly based on the input parameters and input data.

However, due to the complexity of the function and the related functions that it interacts with, it's important to carefully analyze and refactor the function's logic to ensure correctness.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis of possible issues:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version simplifies the function and uses the `unstack` method directly on the input data, without the need for extensive index manipulation. This approach should provide a more reliable unstacking operation and avoid the potential issues identified in the analysis.

It's important to note that this fix is based on the provided information and assumptions, and further testing and validation should be performed to ensure the correctness of the solution. Additionally, the related functions and the test cases should be reviewed to verify that the corrected function aligns with their expectations.
