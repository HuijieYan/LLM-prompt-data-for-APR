The `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` and subsequent `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` errors when running the test functions indicate that the function `_get_level_number()` is encountering issues when trying to retrieve the level number of a specific index. It seems that the MultiIndex instance is not handling tuple names correctly, resulting in these KeyError errors.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple()` function needs to be modified to handle cases where tuple names are present in the MultiIndex instance, as in the failing test scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple()` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        try:
            clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        except ValueError:
            clocs = [clocs]  # If ValueError occurs, assume single level unstack

        rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

        # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
        # ...
    else:
        # Handle single level index
        # ...

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the updated function, we added a check to handle MultiIndex instances differently. If the index is a MultiIndex and the `_get_level_number()` call results in a ValueError, we assume that the unstack operation is meant for a single level index. Therefore, we wrap `clocs` in a list to handle the single level case. Additionally, in this correction, `rlocs`, `clevels`, `ccodes`, `cnames`, `rlevels`, `rcodes`, and `rnames` need to be determined in the non-multiindex case.
