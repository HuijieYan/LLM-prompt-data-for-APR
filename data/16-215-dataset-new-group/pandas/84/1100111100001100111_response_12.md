The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be caused by the handling of hierarchical columns and the interaction between Series and DataFrame inputs. The unstacking operation is intended to reorganize the data, but it doesn't handle MultiIndexed or MultiLevel columns correctly.

When investigating the runtime variables, it's evident that the bug arises from how the new index and columns are assigned to the unstacked data. This creates inconsistency in the new levels, names, and codes, resulting in incorrect output.

The bug is manifested in the provided GitHub issue, where attempting to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex column using `s.unstack(("A", "a"))` leads to a KeyError, indicating that "Level A not found".

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve creating separate handling for Series and DataFrame inputs, ensuring that the new index and columns are properly structured based on the type of input.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
                             codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
                             names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
                             verify_integrity=False)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
        new_columns = MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
          val = clocs[i]
          result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
          clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result
    return unstacked
```
This corrected function introduces separate handling for Series and DataFrame inputs when unstacking based on the levels. It ensures that the new index and columns are structured correctly based on the type of input, resolving the inconsistency and potential KeyError that may occur.
