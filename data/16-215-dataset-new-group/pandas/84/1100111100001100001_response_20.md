The issue with the buggy function seems to be that it fails to handle the hierarchical columns correctly. The function `get_group_index` is used to build group labels for the columns. The code then proceeds to create a `dummy_index` and `dummy` DataFrame, and uses the `unstack` method to unstack data. However, the process of reshaping the data seems to be incorrect, resulting in issues with the final output.

Given the complexity of the function and the interdependency of several operations, it is suggested to rewrite the `_unstack_multiple` function in a simpler and clearer way to handle multi-index unstacking more effectively.

Below is a proposed corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Create a DataFrame with a regular index
    dummy = data.reset_index()

    # Unstack the DataFrame using the provided level (clocs)
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This simplified version first resets the index of the input `data` to create a regular index DataFrame. Then, it uses the `unstack` method directly on the DataFrame using the specified level (`clocs`). This approach should correctly handle both single and multi-level unstacking operations.

By simplifying the unstacking process and using built-in Pandas functionality, we can avoid the intricacies and potential bugs in the original `_unstack_multiple` function.
