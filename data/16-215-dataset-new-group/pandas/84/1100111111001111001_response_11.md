The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to perform unstacking on the input `data` based on the provided column locations `clocs`. However, the function includes several conditional blocks and complex logic that may not handle all possible input cases correctly, leading to failing test cases.

Based on the failing test cases and the analysis of the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the block of code that checks whether `data` is a Series and handles unstacking accordingly. It is failing to correctly handle the multiple indices in the test cases. 

To fix the bug, we will modify the conditional block that handles the case when `data` is a Series with multiple indices. Additionally, we will handle the case when `data` does not match any of the existing conditions, ensuring that the unstacking logic is properly applied in all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        if data.index.nlevels > 1:
            dummy.index = dummy_index
            unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
            
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

After making these changes, the `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` cases should pass successfully, resolving the issues in the original buggy function.
