## Plan

The issue seems to arise from the `_get_level_number` function, which is called in line 317. This function is intended to provide the level number within the MultiIndex; however, if the level provided is a tuple instead of an integer, it results in the error. 

We need to modify `_unstack_multiple` to ensure it properly deals with hierarchical columns and translate each tuple level to the appropriate integer level in the MultiIndex.

Here's the plan to fix the bug:

1. Modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the hierarchical columns.
2. For each tuple level in the `clocs` parameter, translate it to the respective integer level. This can be achieved by processing the tuple and finding the corresponding integer level within the MultiIndex.
3. Make sure to handle hierarchical columns correctly in both cases of input being a Series or a DataFrame.
4. Verify that the function returns the expected results based on the provided input parameters and the given test cases.

By correcting the `_unstack_multiple` function, we should be able to address the KeyError and ValueError issues identified in the GitHub issue and resolve the problem in the failing test cases.

Now, let's implement the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Translate clocs from tuple names to level numbers
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same as in the original function
    # ...
    # (Replace the original code with the previous part of function unchanged)
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This version of the `_unstack_multiple` function takes the "clocs" parameter, identifies if any of the levels are tuples, and translates these tuple levels to the respective integer levels in the MultiIndex. After the translation, the function proceeds with the remaining code as previously specified.

By making this adjustment, the function should be in a shape to handle hierarchical columns correctly and thus fix the errors identified in the failing test cases.

Let me know if there are other issues that need further explanation or assistance!
