The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is experiencing issues with multi-level indexing, which causes it to fail the provided test cases. Specifically, there are errors related to identifying hierarchical column levels (`clocs`). This is resulting in the `KeyError` and `ValueError` seen in the failing tests, which is in line with the GitHub issue description.

The cause of the bug is rooted in how the `_unstack_multiple` function handles multi-index data and hierarchical columns. The process to fix this bug should involve updating the logic for handling hierarchical columns and multi-index data.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly handle the identification and indexing of hierarchical column levels.
2. Implement proper unstacking mechanisms for multi-level indexing.
3. Ensure the function can deal with both single and multi-level column indexing without errors.

Below is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis of the bug and testing issues:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By modifying the logic for identifying hierarchical column levels (`clocs`), this corrected version of the function should now be able to handle both single and multi-level column indexing, therefore resolving the issues observed in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
