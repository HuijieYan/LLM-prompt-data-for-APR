The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be occurring due to a problem with how the function is handling MultiIndex objects. The function attempts to perform an unstack operation on a DataFrame with multi-level columns, which can lead to incorrect results and raise KeyError or ValueError as shown in the GitHub issue. The provided input values and the associated information indicate that the function has not been adequately handling the hierarchical column index which is causing the issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the logic to ensure correct handling of MultiIndex components, proper transformation of the input data, and accurate reshaping of the DataFrame. Additionally, the if-else conditions and variable assignments within the function need to be reviewed and revised to align with the requirement for handling multi-level columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    # Handle non-MultiIndex columns
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Get the levels and codes from the index
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Process the data and handle unstack operation
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy_index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(list(dummy.index), names=[f'level_{i}' for i in range(index.nlevels)])
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack(list(cnames), fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the function distinguishes between multi-level columns and non-multi-level (regular) columns, thus handling the input data based on the column type. Additionally, the variable assignments and unstacking logic are reviewed and adjusted to ensure accurate reshaping of the DataFrame, addressing the issue encountered in the failing tests.
