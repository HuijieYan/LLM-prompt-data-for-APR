The issue in the buggy function seems to stem from the `if` statement on line 37, where the condition for checking if the data is a Series is not properly handled. This results in incorrect handling of the data and incorrect unstacking. 

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly handle the case when the data is a Series and ensure that the unstacking process is performed accurately based on the data type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack()
        new_levels = [dummy_index.levels[1]]
        new_names = [data.name]
        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels, codes=dummy_index.codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
        )
        unstacked.columns = new_columns
    else:
        # Rest of the code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version properly handles the case when the data is a Series and ensures accurate unstacking is performed based on the data type.
