The primary issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely due to the `clocs` variable being a tuple instead of a list, which results in the error raised when trying to access level values. We should fix the function to handle tuple input for `clocs`, and convert it to a list at this stage.

Another issue is the handling of the returned value as sometimes a Series or a DataFrame is returned. This should be handled consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to a list if it's a tuple
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
