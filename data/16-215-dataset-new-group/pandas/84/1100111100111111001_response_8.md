The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be caused by an incorrect manipulation of the MultiIndex object. The `clocs` parameter is expected to be a tuple of strings representing the level names.

The current implementation converts the `clocs` values to a list of level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs`. This leads to a ValueError when the level name is not found in the index's names.

It seems that the function should be handling the `clocs` as level names instead of converting them directly to level numbers. Additionally, there are multiple other operations and variable assignments in the function that miss appropriate checks and manipulations.

To fix this, the function should be modified to correctly handle the level names and perform the necessary operations based on the level names' state in the MultiIndex object.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.get_level_values(level) for level in clocs]
    
    # Creating the dummy DataFrame
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy["__placeholder__"] = 0
    dummy_index = dummy.set_index("__placeholder__", append=True).index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Reconstructing the columns with MultiIndex
    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product(clevels, names=clocs)
    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function starts by obtaining the level values from the names provided in `clocs`. It then creates a dummy DataFrame to simulate the unstacking process, followed by using the `unstack` method on the dummy DataFrame. The resulting unstacked DataFrame is then assigned the newly created MultiIndex, and returned.

This should resolve the issue and allow the function to perform the unstacking operation correctly.

You should re-run your tests to verify that the corrected function now produces the expected outputs and passes the failing tests.
