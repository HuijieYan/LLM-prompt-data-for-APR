The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is caused by incorrect indexing of levels in a MultiIndex object, leading to a KeyError. The issue is that the function is trying to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)` and expecting `i` to be an integer representing the level. However, in the failing test case provided, `clocs` is given as a list of tuples `('A', 'a')` and `('B', 'b')`, which cannot be directly used to index a level.

This bug is reflected in the failing GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" where the `unstack` function is passed a tuple as the level parameter, and this causes the `unstack` function to call `_unstack_multiple` with these tuples causing a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to correctly handle the multi-level indexes and avoid direct indexing of levels. Additionally, it needs to differentiate handling code paths for Series and DataFrames appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clevel_names = [cloc[1] for cloc in clocs]  # Extract level names as list

    # Get level numbers based on level names
    clocs = [index.get_level_number(name) for name in clevel_names]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.names[0]] + cnames  # Use level name from original data
        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, the level numbers are obtained using the level names, and appropriate handling for Series and DataFrames is incorporated. This fix should resolve the KeyErrors occurring due to incorrect level indexing.
