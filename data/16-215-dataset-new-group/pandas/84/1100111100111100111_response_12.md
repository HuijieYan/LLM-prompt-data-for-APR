The bug in the provided function `_unstack_multiple` is occurring because the function is trying to get the level number of a level with a tuple name, which is not currently supported. This is causing the `KeyError` and `ValueError` exceptions when trying to unstack the data.

The function is designed to handle multi-indexed data and attempts to unstack it for better presentation of the data. However, it is encountering issues specifically when the `level` input is a tuple name.

Here are the identified potential error locations:
1. The method `_get_level_number` is used to obtain the level number for a specified level, but it is not able to handle a level specified as a tuple.
2. The way the `clocs` parameter is used with the `index._get_level_number` method is not handling tuple names properly.
3. The subsequent code in the function is processing data based on incorrect level numbers, leading to the incorrect unstacking behavior.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to handle tuple names properly and derive the correct level numbers for unstacking.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_nums = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if not isinstance(cloc, int):
            cloc_name = cloc[0]
        else:
            cloc_name = cloc
        cloc_num = index.names.index(cloc_name)
        cloc_nums.append(cloc_num)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_nums]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By updating the `clocs` parameters into their respective level numbers and ensuring that tuple names are handled correctly, the function should now support unstacking of multi-indexed data with tuple names.

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue and should pass the failing test, resolving the GitHub issue identified.
