The `unstack` function is used within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The primary issue appears to be in the section of the code where the `unstacked` variable is assigned. This assignment depends on the type of the input `data`.

The bug originates from this line:
```python
unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
```
Here, both `dummy` and `__placeholder__` may have the wrong structure or be named incorrectly based on the input `data`.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to first check the structure and type of the input `data`, and then ensure that the `dummy` DataFrame is correctly constructed to be suitable for unstacking with the correct parameters. Additionally, the column names and indices should be assigned appropriately based on the content of the `unstacked` DataFrame.

Here's a corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function based on the analysis provided:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # Existing code
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (existing code)

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (existing code)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.unstack(clocs[0], fill_value=fill_value)  # Correct the unstacking based on the first location in clocs
        # Construct new indices and columns based on the unstacked dummy
        new_columns = dummy.columns
        new_index = dummy.index
        # Create the new unstacked DataFrame
        unstacked = pd.DataFrame(dummy, columns=new_columns, index=new_index)
    else:
        dummy = data.unstack(clocs)  # Correct the unstacking based on clocs
        # Construct new indices and columns based on the unstacked dummy
        new_columns = dummy.columns
        new_index = dummy.index
        # Create the new unstacked DataFrame
        unstacked = pd.DataFrame(dummy, columns=new_columns, index=new_index)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the unstacking operation is fixed to take into account the structure and type of the input data. Also, the correct assignment of columns and indices is ensured to generate the expected result. This should address the issues causing the failing tests.
