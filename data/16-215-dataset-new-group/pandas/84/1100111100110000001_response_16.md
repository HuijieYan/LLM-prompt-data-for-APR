## Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function `_get_level_number` is trying to get the level number of a column not found in the list of names of `MultiIndex`. This error occurs as the function tries to get the level number directly from the names list without processing the tuple properly.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is responsible for obtaining the level number from the tuple list `clocs`.
2. The inconsistency in handling of single index and MultiIndex within the function.
3. Lack of handling exceptions and moving up the traceback incorrectly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused when the function tries to get the level number directly from the names list of `MultiIndex` without handling the tuple structure properly, which leads to the `'A' is not in list` or `KeyError: 'Level A not found'` error messages.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check for MultiIndex types and handle the numerical levels accordingly.
2. Validate the level names if they are tuples in case of MultiIndex and process them to get the correct level number.
3. Improve exception handling to prevent unnecessary errors. 

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
}
```
