### Bug in the Function Analysis

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to find the level number for the specified index. This is happening when executing the failing test for the `unstack` method with a MultiIndex, and it's failing with different error messages depending on the specific use case.

#### Issue with the Function:
The bug appears to be located in the `_unstack_multiple` function when the clocs parameter is a tuple, which indicates that it should unstack multiple levels. The function fails when attempting to extract the level number by calling `index._get_level_number(i)` within a list comprehension. This error is then propagated upwards through the `compress_group_index`, `decons_obs_group_ids`, and `get_group_index` functions, ultimately resulting in a `KeyError` or `ValueError`.

#### Expected Behavior:
The expected behavior should be to successfully unstack the specified levels and return a DataFrame with the correct hierarchical structure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle multi-level indices properly.
2. Address the root cause of the error, which is the incorrect processing of multi-level indices.
3. Ensure the returned DataFrame has the correct structure and values according to the specified unstacking levels.

### Corrected Version of `_unstack_multiple` Function
Based on the analysis and the identified error, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be restructured to handle multi-level indices properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function, updated with a proper handling of multi-level indices:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    levels = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(levels, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for level in levels:
                result = result.unstack(level, fill_value=fill_value)
            return result
        else:
            dummy_index = list(range(data.index.nlevels))
            dummy = data.copy()
            dummy.index = dummy_index
            unstacked = dummy.unstack(levels, fill_value=fill_value)
            return unstacked
```
In this corrected version, the function first checks if the clocs parameter indicates a multi-level unstacking by checking if any of the elements are tuples. Then, it extracts the levels properly and unstacks the data accordingly.

With this corrected implementation, the function should handle multi-level indices correctly and address the KeyError or ValueError that was previously raised.

After applying this fix, the `unstack` method should work as expected for MultiIndex inputs.
