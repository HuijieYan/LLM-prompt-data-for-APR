## The bug
The bug is likely caused by incorrect manipulation of the indexes and columns, resulting in unexpected dimensions and ordering of the dataframe. This discrepancy leads to failing tests and incorrect outputs.

## Fix strategy
To fix the bug, the implementation should accurately handle the creation and manipulation of the index and columns for unstacking. This involves ensuring that the index and columns are reconstructed correctly based on the desired unstacking operation.

## The corrected function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    clocs = [clocs] if not isinstance(clocs[0], (list, tuple)) else list(clocs)

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected function, the primary handling of creating the correct dataframe structure is delegated to the `unstack` method of the DataFrame. The `clocs` parameter is reformatted to be a list of tuples if it is not already in that format. This approach simplifies the function while also ensuring that the correct functionality is utilized.

This approach assumes that the `unstack` method of the DataFrame is correctly implemented and will handle the unstacking operation as desired.

Let's verify if these changes will work.
