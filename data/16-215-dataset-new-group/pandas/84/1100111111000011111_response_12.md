### Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function seems to handle multiple index-related operations, including compressing group indexes, obtaining observed and compressed indexes, creating new index and column levels and names, and assigning values. The issue seems related to MultiIndex operations, particularly when working with tuple names and levels. The failing test cases will also involve MultiIndex operations with different combinations of levels and names.

### Error locations
1. The error might be occurring at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` which could potentially raise a KeyError.
2. Another potential area of concern is the part where the data is manipulated for different types - for `Series` and possibly `DataFrame`

### Bug cause
The bug causes the unstacking to fail when the function is handling MultiIndex with mixed type tuple names. This is evident from the failing test cases which primarily involve multi-level column and index names.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the code associated with level numbers and handling tuple names needs to be revisited. Handling of MultiIndex with mixed type tuple names and levels should be the primary focus. In addition, the code for manipulating the data for `Series` and `DataFrame` types should also be reviewed to check for any potential conversion issues related to MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix
