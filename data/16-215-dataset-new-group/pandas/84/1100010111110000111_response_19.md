The bug occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. It seems that the method is expecting a string as an input and it is unable to handle the case when the input is a tuple.

The cause of the bug originates from the fact that the `_unstack_multiple` function is trying to extract the level index without considering the possibility of dealing with Tuple names within a MultiIndex. This is evident in the failing test and the error message, which shows that the method is expecting a level name but is unable to find it in the list because the input is not a string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to handle the case when the input is a tuple name. We will modify the portion of the code that tries to retrieve level numbers from the index, so that it can handle both string and tuple inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, str):  # For regular indexes
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))
        elif isinstance(cloc, tuple):  # For MultiIndexes
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc[0]))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    # ... Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

After replacing the `_unstack_multiple` function with the corrected version, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test case.
