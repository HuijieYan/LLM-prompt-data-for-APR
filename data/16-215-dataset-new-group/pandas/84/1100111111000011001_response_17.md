The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing the failing test to produce an incorrect result. The bug is likely located in the section of code that handles the case where `data` is not a `Series` but has multi-level columns. The bug may be due to incorrect indexing and unstacking operations within this section of code.

To fix the bug, we should revise the code that handles multi-level columns and correctly modify the levels, names, and codes for the columns to ensure that the unstacked dataframe has the correct structure. We should also ensure that the index of the unstacked dataframe is correctly set based on the unstacking operation.

Given the explanation above, the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function should include changes in the section that handles multi-level columns to ensure that the unstacking operation and the resulting dataframe's structure are correct.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index
        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = [index.levels[level] for level in rlocs] + clevels
        new_names = [index.names[level] for level in rlocs] + cnames
        new_codes = [index.codes[level] for level in rlocs] + recons_codes
        
    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

By making these changes, the corrected function will handle the unstacking operation for multi-level columns correctly and should now pass the failing test.
