The error messages show that the `get_level_number` method is unable to find the specified level within the MultiIndex. The keys 'A' and 'a' are not found within the list, resulting in a `KeyError` or a `ValueError`. This suggests that the level names are not being identified correctly, which indicates that the get_level_number method is encountering an issue when trying to locate the specific levels within the MultiIndex names.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_level_number` method is searching for the level names in an incorrect way, resulting in the KeyError and ValueError.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that `get_level_number` refers to the correct attributes when searching for the level names in the MultiIndex. This means checking the level names correctly and ensuring that they are being identified based on the correct criteria.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _get_level_number(index, level) -> int:
    count = index.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not isinstance(level, int):
        raise ValueError(f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number")
    try:
        if isinstance(level, int):
            return level
        return index.names.get_loc(level)
    except ValueError:
        raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [_get_level_number(index, i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

In this version, a new function `_get_level_number` is defined to correctly identify the level number or index within the MultiIndex. The function allows the check for the level names to be performed based on the correct criteria.
