### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` seems to be dealing with unstacking hierarchical columns in a DataFrame. It is trying to reorganize the structure of the DataFrame using the provided inputs `data` and `clocs`. 

The error message suggests that there is an issue with the index and column names. It seems that the function is encountering problems with the level names and their corresponding indexes, leading to ValueError and KeyError exceptions.

Looking at the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output variable values, it seems that the function is failing to correctly extract the levels, codes, and names from the index, and subsequently, it runs into issues when setting up a new index and restructuring the columns. This results in the incorrect organization of the DataFrame, leading to the exceptions seen in the error messages.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to correctly handle the hierarchical nature of the DataFrame index and columns. This includes ensuring that the level names, codes, and structure are accurately reflected in the output of the unstacking process. Additionally, handling multi-indexes and multi-level columns requires careful manipulation to avoid issues with inconsistencies between the structure and content of the dataframe components.

### Corrected function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The above corrected function simplifies the logical structure and uses pandas' built-in `unstack` method to handle the unstacking process. This leverages the existing functionality within pandas to correctly unstack hierarchical columns in a DataFrame.

It's important to note that debugging and testing with actual datasets is essential to ensure the correctness of the function.
