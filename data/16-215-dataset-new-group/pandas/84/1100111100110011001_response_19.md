The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be occurring when trying to extract the index level number for a given parameter. This error message indicates that the provided level name is not found in the list of the index names or that it occurs multiple times.

The cause of the bug is due to the use of incorrect index names or levels when trying to extract the level number. This could be caused by incorrect handling of multi-level indexes.

To fix the bug:
- We need to ensure that we are using the correct index names and levels when extracting the level number.
- If the provided `level` is a tuple of names, we need to handle this case as well to extract the appropriate level number.
- We need to update the code to handle multi-level indexes properly and ensure that the level names and numbers are handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert level name to level number
    def get_level_number(level):
        # Handle tuples of names
        if isinstance(level, tuple):
            level_names = level
        else:
            level_names = (level,)
            
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in level_names]
        return tuple(level_numbers) if len(level_numbers) > 1 else level_numbers[0]

    cloc_numbers = [get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the original implementation...
}
```

In this corrected version, we use a nested function `get_level_number` to handle cases where the provided `level` is a tuple of names. This allows us to extract the level numbers correctly.

By applying this fix, we ensure that level names and numbers are handled appropriately, thereby resolving the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function.
