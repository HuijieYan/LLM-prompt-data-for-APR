## Fixing the bug

Based on the input/output variable values, the expected input/output variable values, and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the current implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function is failing to unstack the `data` correctly, which leads to unexpected results. The function seems to be incorrectly processing the `clocs` parameter and the index attributes in the case of a MultiIndex. This results in a KeyError during unstacking.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for handling `clocs` to correctly handle multi-level index cases and ensure that the unstacking operation yields the expected result.

#### Adjusted strategy for fixing the bug
1. Modify the logic for processing `clocs` to handle multi-level indexes correctly.
2. Unstack the `data` using the updated `clocs` handling, ensuring that the unstacked result aligns with the expected output format.

#### Corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    
    # Adapt the clocs processing for multi-level indexes
    clevel_names = [c if isinstance(c, str) else c[0] for c in clocs]
    clevel_values = [c[1] if isinstance(c, tuple) else None for c in clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(cname) if cvalue is None else index._get_loc(cvalue, level=cname) for cname, cvalue in zip(clevel_names, clevel_values)]
    
    # Rest of the existing code
    # ...
```

By modifying the clocs processing to correctly handle multi-level indexes, we ensure that the function will correctly identify the level numbers or level values, and the subsequent unstacking operation should produce the correct output.

This would resolve the issue related to unstacking MultiIndexed data with tuple names and should align with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue and the provided input/output cases.
