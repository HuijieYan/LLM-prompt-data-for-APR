The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is a function in the `reshape.py` file that takes in `data`, `clocs`, and `fill_value` as parameters. It performs various operations on the input data and returns the resultant unstacked output.

The cause of the bug:
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is causing an issue during the process of creating a `MultiIndex` to unstack the data. Specifically, when the input data has more than one level of index and the unstack operation is performed with `unstack(("A", "a"))`, it throws a KeyError, causing the code to fail.

The error is traced in the following part of the code:
```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```
When converting the input level names to their corresponding numbers using `index._get_level_number`, it throws a KeyError which results in the failure of the unstack operation.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
The issue arises from handling multiple levels of indices. The fix involves properly identifying and processing the multiple levels of indices. The function needs to correctly process the multi-level index and perform the unstack operation without KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = []
    for level in clocs:
        try:
            number = index._get_level_number(level)
            level_numbers.append(number)
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f'Level {level} not found')

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in level_numbers]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=index.levels + [obs_ids],
            codes=index.codes + [comp_ids],
            names=index.names + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        columns = unstacked.index.set_names(cnames)
        unstacked.index = columns

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

        columns = unstacked.columns.set_names(cnames)
        unstacked.columns = columns

    return unstacked
```
In the corrected version:
1. A for loop is used to iterate through the `clocs` level names and retrieve their corresponding numbers. If a KeyError is encountered, an appropriate KeyError is raised.
2. The revised code also ensures that the resulting unstacked output has the correct level names. If the input is a Series, the index names are set. If the input is not a Series, the column names are set.

This should resolve the issue of unstacking with tuple names and prevent the occurrences of KeyErrors when processing levels in the multi-index.
