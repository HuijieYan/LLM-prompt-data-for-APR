The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the incorrect manipulation of the index and columns of the DataFrame. The `clocs` parameter, which contains the column levels to unstack, is being used to obtain the index levels for unstacking, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the correct levels for unstacking should be obtained from the column levels of the DataFrame, instead of using the `clocs` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Obtain the column levels for unstacking
    clevels = data.columns.remove_unused_levels().levels
    ccodes = data.columns.remove_unused_levels().codes
    cnames = data.columns.remove_unused_levels().names

    # Perform unstacking
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version computes the `clevels`, `ccodes`, and `cnames` directly from the DataFrame's columns, and uses the `unstack` method to unstack the DataFrame based on the specified column levels. The correction involves removing any unused levels from the columns to ensure that only relevant levels are considered during unstacking.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the unstacking operation without causing the ValueError.
