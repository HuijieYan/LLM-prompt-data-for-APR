The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly when attempting to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names. Specifically, the bug occurs when trying to extract the level number for a tuple level that represents the column ordering in the index.

The cause of the bug is that the `_unstack_multiple` function is not handling tuple names correctly, leading to errors when attempting to unstack the data.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names correctly. This includes properly extracting the level number for tuple levels and handling the unstacking process for such MultiIndexes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex) and all(isinstance(loc, tuple) for loc in clocs):
        # Handle MultiIndex with tuple names
        locs_as_values = [val for loc in clocs for val in loc]
        level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in locs_as_values]

        # Update clocs to use the extracted level numbers
        clocs = level_numbers

    # Continued from here...
}
```

The main change is the addition of conditional logic to handle MultiIndexes with tuple names when extracting the level numbers for the given locations. If all the locations are tuples, they are first unpacked into a flat list, and then the level numbers are extracted from the MultiIndex. The rest of the function remains the same.

With this updated function, it should be able to correctly handle MultiIndexes with tuple names and unstack the data when multiple locations are provided for unstacking. After implementing this change, the failing test cases identified should pass when executed, and the GitHub issue related to unstacking MultiIndexes with tuple names would be resolved.

This revised function helps maintain pandas' method for handling MultiIndexes with tuple names, which leads to a more reliable unstacking process and resolves the KeyError reported in the GitHub issue.

Please note that the code provided is based on the assumption of its functionality and the specifics of the bug. It should be rigorously tested with the relevant scenarios to ensure that it effectively addresses the issue.
