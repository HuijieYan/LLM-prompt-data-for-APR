The issue seems to be with the calculation of the `clocs` variable, which is returning an incorrect value based on the input in all three cases. This is causing the subsequent code to fail.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `clocs` variable is being correctly calculated from the input `('A', 'a')` in Case 1, `('A', 'a')` in Case 2, and `(('A', 'a'), 'B')` in Case 3.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs] if isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)) else [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

The primary change I made is to ensure that `clocs` is always a list of level numbers, even if it is a single level. This should help address the issue seen in the failing tests.
