The issue with the buggy function seems to be with the `clocs` input parameter. The `clocs` parameter is expected to be a tuple of tuples but it seems to be incorrectly passed as a nested tuple. The function is not handling this situation correctly, resulting in the error.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to handle both tuple and nested tuple inputs for the `clocs` parameter. We should also make sure to appropriately handle MultiIndex with multiple levels.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [clocs]  # Ensuring clocs is a list of tuples

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    levels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    codes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    names = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in levels]
    group_index = get_group_index(codes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, codes, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

The updated function will handle both single-level and multi-level `clocs` input parameters and should fix the issues that were causing the failing tests.
