The `clocs` is a list of combined columns to be unstacked, which may contain single or multiple levels. The error occurs due to the `clocs` not being properly identified to be used in further processing.

Upon analyzing the error messages and the GitHub issue, the potential causes of the bug are identified:
1. The `clocs` list is not generated accurately, leading to an issue in the subsequent processing.
2. The error occurs when getting the level number by name from the index. It leads to a KeyError or ValueError, indicating that the level name is not found in the list of names.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to accurately identify the `clocs` list for processing and ensuring that the respective named levels are present in the index to avoid the KeyError or ValueError.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy_index = Index([j[-1] for j in ccodes], name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
            return result

        dummy_index = Index([j[-1] for j in ccodes], name="__placeholder__", verify_integrity=False)

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This version should address the issues by accurately identifying the `clocs` list and handling the unstacking process accordingly. It should avoid the KeyError and ValueError raised for incorrect level names and index references.
