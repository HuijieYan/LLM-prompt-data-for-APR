## The problem in the buggy function
The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing because it's not properly handling the multi-level index and is encountering issues related to the naming and level number of the multi-index columns.

The error message and the runtime values indicate that the function is not correctly retrieving the level number for the column names, and this is leading to KeyError and ValueError exceptions.

Furthermore, the function fails to correctly handle the multi-level index, leading to unexpected output for the unstacked DataFrame.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the level number for the column names in the multi-level index. Additionally, the function should ensure that it appropriately handles the multi-level index and produces the expected unstacked DataFrame.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    columns = data.columns

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

The corrected version of the function directly uses the `unstack` method on the DataFrame or Series based on the input, handling the multi-level index columns appropriately.

This should resolve the issues and ensure that the function produces the expected unstacked DataFrame.
