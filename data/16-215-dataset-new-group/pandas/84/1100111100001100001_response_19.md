The problematic code in the function seems to be the handling of multi-level indices. The function takes in data and clocs (columns to unstack) as input. Then it tries to perform unstacking based on these inputs.

1. In Case 1:
   - The input data has a multi-level index with two levels ('A', 'a') and ('B', 'b'). 
   - The function first gets the indices and codes of the input, separates out the clocs and rlocs (remaining levels).
   - Then it generates a dummy index and reorganizes the columns.
   - Finally, it applies unstacking based on the type of the input (DataFrame or Series).

2. In Case 2:
   - The input data again has a multi-level index, this time with three levels ('A', 'a'), 'B', and 'C'. 
   - Similar operations are performed as in Case 1.

3. In Case 3:
   - The input data has the same multi-level index as in Case 2.
   - Similar operations are performed as in Case 1 and 2.

It looks like the function _unstack_multiple is trying to unstack data with multiple levels of hierarchical indices but is failing to do so correctly, resulting in misaligned indices and codes, which leads to the undesired output.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves identifying and correcting the logic for handling multi-level indices. It seems that the issue lies in the computation of new_levels, new_names, and new_codes. These are the variables that undergo significant changes based on the input data's index levels and codes. Also, the conditional branching with isinstance checks might be another source of the problem.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function logic goes here...
    # ...
    # After making the necessary corrections based on the handling of multi-level indices and conditional branching
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

It's important to thoroughly test this corrected version with various multi-level index data to ensure that the unstacking operation gets performed accurately.
