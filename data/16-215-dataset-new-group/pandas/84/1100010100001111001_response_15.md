The bug in the given function is causing incorrect unstacking of the data when there are multiple levels of columns. The bug causes the unstacked data to have the wrong column names and levels.

The bug is located in the section where the new_columns and unstacked variables are being assigned. The incorrect handling of the columns and levels during unstacking is leading to the incorrect output.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the unstacked data has the correct column names and levels. This will involve correctly mapping the columns and assigning the right levels during unstacking.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels(cnames)
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        unstacked.columns = unstacked.columns.reorder_levels(cnames)

    return unstacked

```

In the corrected version, after unstacking the data, the columns are reordered to ensure that they have the correct levels and names. This should ensure that the unstacked data has the expected structure.
