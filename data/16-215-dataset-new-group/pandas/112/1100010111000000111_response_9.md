The buggy function `get_indexer` is not handling the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This is causing the `df.round()` method to fail when using such columns.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` function is not properly handling the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This results in a TypeError being raised when calling the `round` method on a DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to be updated to properly handle the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None,limit: Optional[int] = None,tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # Check if target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

With this corrected version of the `get_indexer` function, the `round` method should now properly handle the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
