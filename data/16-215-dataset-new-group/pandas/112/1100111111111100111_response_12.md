The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely causing the test to fail. The function is supposed to generate indices for a target array based on the index values of the `self` object. However, it seems that the implementation of `get_indexer` is not correctly handling the case where `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`.

The current implementation includes conditional branches for different cases: when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, when it's not an object dtype, and when it is an object dtype. However, it appears that the conditional branches might not be correctly handling the case where `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, leading to the failure of the round method when the columns are a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the implementation of the `get_indexer` method correctly handles the case where `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In this corrected version, when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, the function directly delegates the indexing operation to the `_engine` to get the indexers, and the other cases are handled by calling the `get_indexer` method from the superclass (`Index`).

By making this correction, the `get_indexer` function should now correctly handle the case where `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
