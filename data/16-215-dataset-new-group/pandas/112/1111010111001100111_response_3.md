To fix the bug, there are a few potential error locations within the `get_indexer` function: 

1. The check for overlapping indices might be incorrect, leading to an error.
2. The implementation of `target_as_index` might be causing the bug when handling `IntervalIndex` as opposed to a scalar index or a homogeneous scalar index.
3. There might be an issue when using the `IntervalTree` for non-homogeneous scalars.

Based on the failing test and runtime input/output values, it seems that the method is having trouble with the `IntervalIndex` data type, which is causing the `round` function to fail when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`. The current implementation of `get_indexer` does not handle overlapping indices properly, and it may have issues when dealing with `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the implementation correctly handles overlapping indices and handles `IntervalIndex` appropriately when determining the indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use " "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        # For non-IntervalIndex types, handle appropriately
        # This assumes a scalar index or a homogeneous scalar index
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have improved the handling of `IntervalIndex` and non-`IntervalIndex` types, ensuring that overlapping indices are properly handled and the appropriate indexer is returned.

With this correction, the test case that previously failed should now pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
