The issue here seems to be related to the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class, which is failing to handle overlapping indices when the columns are of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The expected behavior is for the `round` method to work as normal even when the columns are of this type, but it is currently failing with a `TypeError`.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` might not be correctly checking for overlapping indices.
2. The logic for handling different types of indices (`target_as_index`) and the conversion to `IntervalTree` might not be handling the specific case of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly.

### Cause of the bug
The bug may be caused by the failure of the buggy function to handle the conversion of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` to an `IntervalTree` properly, leading to a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the condition for checking overlapping indices (`self.is_overlapping`) is correct.
2. Review the handling of different types of indices (`target_as_index`) and the conversion to `IntervalTree` to ensure that it properly handles cases where the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []

            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)

```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping` condition is properly called as a method (`self.is_overlapping()`) to check for overlapping indices. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of indices and the conversion to `IntervalTree` has been reviewed to ensure proper handling of cases where the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
