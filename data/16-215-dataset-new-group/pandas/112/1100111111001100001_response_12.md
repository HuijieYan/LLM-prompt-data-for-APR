The buggy function `get_indexer` is failing to handle overlapping indices. The issue seems to be with the logic for handling overlapping indices. 

In the provided runtime values, the `self.is_overlapping` variable is set to `False`, indicating that the indices should not be overlapping. However, the logic inside the function checks `if self.is_overlapping`, which does not seem correct. It should be `if not self.is_overlapping`. 

Additionally, the error message is raised with `self.is_overlapping`, but it should check for the condition of overlapping indices and raise an error accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # Check if the indices are overlapping
    if not self.is_overlapping():
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the logic remains the same
            # ...
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # Rest of the logic remains the same
            # ...
        else:
            # Rest of the logic remains the same
            # ...
    else:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
```

By making these corrections, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
