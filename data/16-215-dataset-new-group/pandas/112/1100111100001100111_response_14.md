The bug in the given code lies in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. When the `self.is_overlapping` condition is checked, it is not being evaluated as a method call, which is what is desired. Hence, the condition always remains True, leading to the provided error.

To fix this issue, the condition `self.is_overlapping` should be evaluated as a method call by adding parentheses: `self.is_overlapping()`. This will correctly call the `is_overlapping` method, allowing the condition to be evaluated based on the method's return value.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Modified to call the is_overlapping method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
```

After making this change, the `is_overlapping` condition will be correctly evaluated, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
