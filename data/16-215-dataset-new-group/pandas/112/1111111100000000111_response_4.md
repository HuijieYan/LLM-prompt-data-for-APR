## Analysis
The issue seems to be related to the `round` method failing when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class, so it may possibly be causing the issue.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The `get_indexer` function checks for overlapping indices and raises an error if found.
2. It then tries to handle different cases based on the type of index provided and returns an indexer.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug could be caused by the `get_indexer` function not properly handling `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. It might be incorrectly handling the different types of indices and leading to a failure when using the `round` method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function properly handles `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve debugging the internal logic of the function, identifying the specific condition that causes the failure, and implementing a fix to handle `CategoricalIndex` appropriately.

## Corrected Version
```python
# Assume that the previous imports are available

class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):

    # Other functions remain unchanged

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # Add specific handling for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories  # Extract categories
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index)  # Convert to index type
    
        # Other logic remains unchanged
        # ...
```

In the corrected version, we have added specific handling for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. We extract the categories and ensure that the target is converted to the appropriate index type. This should allow the `get_indexer` function to handle `CategoricalIndex` appropriately and prevent the `round` method from failing.
