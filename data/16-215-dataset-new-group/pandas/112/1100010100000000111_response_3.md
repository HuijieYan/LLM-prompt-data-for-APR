Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, the issue seems to be related to the datatype mismatch when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as categorical index made from an IntervalIndex.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The datatype comparison and conversion when checking the target index in the `get_indexer` function.
2. The handling of heterogeneous scalar index in the `get_indexer` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` function does not handle the datatype conversion and comparison properly for categorical index made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a mismatch in possible signatures and resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can add a specific condition to handle the categorical index made from an IntervalIndex in the `get_indexer` function by properly converting the datatype and comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the target index is a CategoricalIndex with categories as an IntervalIndex, then we update `target_as_index` with the categories of the CategoricalIndex.

This fix should address the issue related to the `round` method failing when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and it should allow the `round` method to work as expected.
