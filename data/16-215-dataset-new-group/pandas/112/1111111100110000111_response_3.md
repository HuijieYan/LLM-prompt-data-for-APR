From the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems like the `round` method fails when columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. The issue appears to be related to the `get_indexer` method in the `interval.py` file. The error message points to a problem with the signature when calling `get_indexer`. Additionally, the GitHub issue indicates that the `round` method should work normally when the columns are of this type.

The potential error locations within the `get_indexer` method could be in the conditionals that check the type of the `target_as_index` and the subsequent calls to `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

The cause of the bug is related to the failure to correctly handle the `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. This leads to a TypeError indicating that no matching signature is found for the `get_indexer` method.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully handle the case when the `target_as_index` is of type `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. This could involve making sure the `get_indexer` method can handle this specific case correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # handle IntervalIndex case
            return super().get_indexer(target_as_index, method, limit, tolerance)
        else:
            # handle other cases
            return super().get_indexer(target, method, limit, tolerance)
```

In this corrected version, we call the parent class's (Index) `get_indexer` method to handle cases where the `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`. This ensures that the specific handling for `IntervalIndex` is carried out correctly.

With this fix, the `round` method should work normally when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
