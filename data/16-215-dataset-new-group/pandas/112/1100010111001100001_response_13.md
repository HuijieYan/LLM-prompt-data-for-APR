The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be occurring in the portion of code where it handles the case for `is_overlapping` being `False`. The bug seems to be related to the way the function processes the `target` input and also how it handles the `target_as_index` variable.

The issue seems to be that the function is not properly handling the case where `target` is of type `IntervalIndex` and is equal to `self`. The function should return `np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")` in this case, but it is not doing so.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to properly handle the case where `target` is equal to `self`. We should also ensure that the function handles the other cases correctly, including the case where `target` is a scalar index or a heterogeneous scalar index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        result = np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp") if self.equals(target_as_index) else np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        result = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        result = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(result)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case where `target` is an `IntervalIndex` and is equal to `self` by returning `np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")`. For the other cases, we handle the logic to return the result based on the input type and values.

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
