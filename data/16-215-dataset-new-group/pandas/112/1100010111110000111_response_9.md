The bug in the function `get_indexer` stems from the attempt to call the `get_indexer` method using a CategoricalIndex. This results in a TypeError due to no matching signature found. The issue is linked to the failing test in `test_round_interval_category_columns`. The root cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method is not compatible with a scalar target.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method should appropriately handle the case when the target is a scalar within a CategoricalIndex. This can be addressed by updating the logic within the `get_indexer` method to handle the scalar target properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case when target is an interval index
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    else:
        # For other cases, handle the indexing based on the target type
        return super().get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In this corrected version, if the target is an IntervalIndex, the method uses the standard behavior by calling the super().get_indexer method. For other cases, the method resolves the target_as_index and passes it to the super().get_indexer method.

This update addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensures that the `get_indexer` method can handle different types of targets, including when the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
