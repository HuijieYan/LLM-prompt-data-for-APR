The bug in the `get_indexer` function appears to be related to the condition where `self.is_overlapping` is `False`, but the code still attempts to handle overlapping indices.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional block that checks for `self.is_overlapping` to ensure that any logic for handling overlapping indices is only executed when `self.is_overlapping` is `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
  
    self._check_method(method)
  
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
  
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
  
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        # rest of the logic for handling IntervalIndex
        # ...
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # rest of the logic for handling non-IntervalIndex
        # ...
    else:
        # rest of the logic for handling heterogeneous scalar index
        # ...
  
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling overlapping indices has been kept within the conditional block `if self.is_overlapping`, and other scenarios are handled with the appropriate logic. This ensures that the code only attempts to handle overlapping indices when `self.is_overlapping` is `True`.
