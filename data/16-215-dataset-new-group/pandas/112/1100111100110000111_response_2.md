The buggy function `get_indexer` belongs to the `IntervalIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`. This function is responsible for generating indexer values for a specified target. The issue is related to the behavior of the `round` method when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The failing test has provided insight into the specific error message: `TypeError: No matching signature found`. 

Upon reviewing the code, it is observed that the `get_indexer` function calls other methods and also interacts with other classes such as `IntervalTree`, `CategoricalIndex`, and the internal index structure `mgr`. The error message indicates that a matching signature is not found when getting the indexer. This suggests that the function expects a certain signature for the target but does not receive it.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class to ensure that it handles the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. We also need to ensure that the function receives the expected signature when interacting with other methods or classes.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        indexer = self.categories.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` specifically. We use the `get_indexer` method of the `categories` attribute to correctly handle the target in this case. For other cases, we delegate the indexer generation to the base class using `super().get_indexer`.

By making these changes, the `get_indexer` function should now handle the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly and pass the failing test. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
