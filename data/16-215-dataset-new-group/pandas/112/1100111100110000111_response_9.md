Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the error message, it appears that the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class has an issue when handling a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, causing a TypeError. The issue was also raised in a GitHub post.

The cause of the bug seems to involve the way the method handles the `target_as_index` when created from a `CategoricalIndex`. It fails to match the signatures correctly, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to update the implementation of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to properly handle the `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. This can be achieved by modifying the method to handle the `target_as_index` appropriately based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    ...
    # other class methods

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
                    Raises
                    ------
                    NotImplementedError
                        If any method argument other than the default of
                        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
                    """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            return target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
        else:
            if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
                # rest of the previous implementation for handling IntervalIndex
                # ...
            else:
                # rest of the previous implementation for other cases
                # ...

```

In this corrected version, we add a condition to handle when the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`. Instead of attempting to use the `get_indexer` method on `target_as_index`, we call the `get_indexer` method on `target_as_index` with `self` as the argument when the index is a `CategoricalIndex`, as it provides the appropriate handling for `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`.

By making this change, we ensure that the `get_indexer` method is able to handle `CategoricalIndex` properly, resolving the bug and enabling the `round` method to work as expected for columns with `CategoricalIndex` derived from `IntervalIndex`.
