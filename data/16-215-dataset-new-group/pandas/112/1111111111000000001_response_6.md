The bug in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class is likely related to the conditional check in the following line:
```python
if self.is_overlapping:
```
The bug causes the code to erroneously raise an `InvalidIndexError` when `self.is_overlapping` should in fact be a method call: `self.is_overlapping()`. This leads to the error in the failing test, causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, we should correct the conditional check to call the `is_overlapping` method. Additionally, we should also ensure that the `is_overlapping` method returns the expected boolean value to make sure the condition is evaluated correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By calling the `is_overlapping` method correctly and ensuring it returns the expected boolean value, the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function should pass the failing test.
