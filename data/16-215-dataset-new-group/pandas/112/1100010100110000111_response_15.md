The bug appears to be occurring within the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class when the DataFrame's `round` method is being invoked and the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found". This suggests that the method `get_indexer` is being called with an argument of an incorrect type or shape, leading to a type error during the method call.

The `get_indexer` method itself is quite complex and involves a series of checks and operations depending on the type and properties of the `target` argument. The bug likely arises from inconsistencies between the type or shape of the `target` argument and the expected input for the method.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully examining the behavior of the `get_indexer` method in the context of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and ensuring that the type and shape of the `target` argument are compatible with the method's expectations.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method for the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle IntervalIndex
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype=int)
        for i in range(len(target_as_index)):
            indexer[i] = self.get_loc(target_as_index[i])

    elif isinstance(target_as_index, (pd.CategoricalIndex, pd.Int64Index)):
        # Handle CategoricalIndex or Int64Index
        indexer = self.get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index)
    else:
        # Handle other cases
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the method now explicitly handles the case of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex by using `get_indexer_non_unique` which is intended to handle these types of indexes. Additionally, appropriate handling for other cases is provided for robustness. The changes address the type error and align the method's behavior with the correct use cases.
