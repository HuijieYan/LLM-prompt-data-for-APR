## Fixing the bug

### Bug analysis
The bug seems to occur in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The TypeError is raised when trying to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. It seems that the `_engine` attribute is not being properly initialized or accessed. Additionally, the bug seems to be related to the `IntervalIndex` class, and it is likely that the method is not handling the `CategoricalIndex` columns correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `IntervalIndex` class handles CategoricalIndex columns correctly in the `get_indexer` method. This might involve proper initialization and access of the `_engine` attribute, as well as proper handling of the `CategoricalIndex` columns.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    # rest of the code remains the same...
}
```

In the corrected version, we check if `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` and if its categories are an `IntervalIndex`, in which case we use `target_as_index.categories` as the actual target index for further processing. This should ensure that the `get_indexer` method properly handles `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex`.
