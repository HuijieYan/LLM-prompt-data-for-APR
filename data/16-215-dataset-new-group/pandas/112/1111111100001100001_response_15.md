The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison and handling of IntervalIndex objects. The function is supposed to return an indexer array based on the input target and method, but it seems to be encountering issues with overlapping indices and elementwise comparisons.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it appears that the function is not handling overlapping indices correctly. When `self.is_overlapping` is False, it should handle non-overlapping indices, but the implementation seems to be incorrectly checking for overlapping indices and raising an error, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, you should focus on correcting the handling of overlapping and non-overlapping indices. Additionally, the logic for comparing and matching the indices needs to be reviewed and potentially adjusted.

Below is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises

    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        raise NotImplementedError("Overlapping indices are not yet implemented.")

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_list_like(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `is_overlapping()` method is called to correctly determine if the indices are overlapping.
- The comparison and matching logic for non-overlapping indices has been refined to ensure proper handling.
- Various checks and conversions for different index types have been adjusted for better compatibility.

By addressing these issues, the corrected version of the function should handle the input indices properly and return the expected indexer array.
