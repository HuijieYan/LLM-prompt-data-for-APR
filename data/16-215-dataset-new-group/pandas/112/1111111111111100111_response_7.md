To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, we need to address the issue identified in the failing test and the runtime values. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect usage of the `get_indexer` function with `IntervalIndex` columns. This leads to a TypeError due to no matching signature found.

The issue is observed when trying to call the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This indicates that there may be a compatibility issue between the `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`.

To resolve the bug, we need to consider the compatibility of `IntervalIndex` with `CategoricalIndex` and ensure that the `get_indexer` function is used correctly. We will need to check if the `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` columns can be handled appropriately in the `get_indexer` function.

Given that this is a compatibility issue, we need to update the `get_indexer` function to handle the `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` columns correctly and have a matching signature.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if (
        self.is_overlapping
        and isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex)
        and isinstance(target.values, pd._libs.interval.IntervalArray)
    ):
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
    else:
        # rest of the code remains the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case where the `IntervalIndex` column is being used in combination with `CategoricalIndex`, and raise an error to prevent overlapping indices with this combination.

This fix should address the compatibility issue and handle the `IntervalIndex` columns correctly when using the `get_indexer` function, thus resolving the bug.
