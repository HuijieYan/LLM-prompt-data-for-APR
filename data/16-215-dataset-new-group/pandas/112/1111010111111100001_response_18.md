To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, we need to address the `TypeError: No matching signature found` issue that is causing the failing test. 

The error message indicates that there is a problem with the function signature or the type(s) of the input parameter. In the failing test, the `get_indexer` function is being called with a scalar target, and the error occurs when trying to use the `_engine.get_indexer` method. 

Upon analyzing the input parameters and relevant variables, we find that the `target_as_index.values` attribute is an `IntervalArray`, which may be causing the type mismatch. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `get_indexer` function to handle the `IntervalArray` type when using the `_engine.get_indexer` method. We also need to ensure that the input parameter types are compatible with the method being called.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # unchanged logic as provided
    else:
        # handle IntervalArray input type
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalArray):
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.dropna())
        else:
            # for other cases, handle as before
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version of the function, we added a condition to handle input of type `IntervalArray` separately by calling the `_engine.get_indexer` method with the non-null values of the `IntervalArray`.

By making this adjustment, we address the type mismatch issue and ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle the different types of input parameters effectively. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
