The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to the `get_indexer` method when calling the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns of interval type. Based on the runtime input and output values, the issue might be in the conditional statement checking for `is_object_dtype(target_as_index)`.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of scalar indexes when the target is an object dtype. The code is trying to perform operations on `target_as_index` as if it were not an object dtype, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `target_as_index` is an object dtype differently. It seems the intention is to iterate through the target elements and attempt to find their location in the IntervalIndex.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        pass
    else:
        # Handling when target_as_index is an object dtype
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                indexer.append(loc)
            except KeyError:
                indexer.append(-1)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we have added a new logic block to handle the case where `target_as_index` is an object dtype. We iterate through the elements of `target_as_index` and attempt to find their location in the IntervalIndex using `self.get_loc(key)`. If the key is not found, we append -1 to the indexer array.

This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue and ensure that the `get_indexer` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test case.
