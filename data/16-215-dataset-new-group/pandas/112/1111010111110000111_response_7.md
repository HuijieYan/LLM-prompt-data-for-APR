Based on the information provided, it seems that the error is related to the `get_indexer` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file, and is specifically linked to the issue titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex" on GitHub. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to no matching signature found.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` function is the usage of `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method signature is not matching with the arguments being passed to it. This prevents the `round` method from executing successfully when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, you would need to review the `get_indexer` method, ensure that the method signature matches the arguments being passed, and modify the method logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Other conditions remain unchanged
            # ...
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # Other conditions remain unchanged
            # ...
        else:
            # Since the cause of the bug seems to be related to the error in dtype handling, 
            # we can update the logic for handling heterogeneous scalar index as follows
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self._engine.get_indexer(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected version, the `get_indexer` method should now correctly handle the dtype and method signature issues, and the `TypeError` should be resolved, allowing the `round` method to work as expected.

This proposed solution should address the bug and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
