The potential error location within the buggy function is the `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):` block and the subsequent `elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):` block.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the input target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which results in the round method failing when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check to handle the case where the input target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target.categories)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to handle the case where the input target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If this condition is met, we extract the categories from the CategoricalIndex and use it as the target index. Otherwise, we proceed with the original logic to handle the target as an IntervalIndex.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex".
