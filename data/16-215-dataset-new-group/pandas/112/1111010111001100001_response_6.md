The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is failing to handle the case where the target index is the same as the interval index. The buggy function correctly checks if the target is an `IntervalIndex` and then attempts to compare the indexes and return the result.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the case where the target `IntervalIndex` is the same as the original `IntervalIndex`. Instead of returning the positional match, it incorrectly attempts to find a common subtype and check for equality. This results in incorrect indexing and a failure to return the correct positional match.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the target index is the same as the original index using the `equals` method, and if so, return the correct positional match using `np.arange`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        # other parameters remain as is
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
        # rest of the original code remains the same

```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where the target index is the same as the original index and return the positional match as expected. This should resolve the failing test case.
