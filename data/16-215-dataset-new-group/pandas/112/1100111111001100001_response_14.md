The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex objects and the comparison of their attributes.

Looking at the `get_indexer` function, it is clear that the bug occurs when comparing two IntervalIndex objects. The bug manifests when the following conditions are met:
- The `self` IntervalIndex has `is_overlapping` set to `False`.
- The `target` IntervalIndex is of the same type as `self` and its attributes such as `closed`, `dtype`, `left`, and `right` match those of `self`.

The issue seems to arise from how the code handles the comparison of the IntervalIndex objects and their attributes. Since the fail occurs when comparing two IntervalIndex objects, it's likely that the bug lies within the comparison logic in the block that starts with `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):`.

It's also worth noting that the bug might be related to the way the left and right indexes are being compared and the resultant indexer being generated.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic when handling two IntervalIndex objects and their attributes will need to be reviewed, and it might be necessary to adjust the logic for comparing left and right indexes.

Here's a possible corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.full(len(target_as_index), -1, dtype="intp")
        return indexer
    else:
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version of the function simplifies the comparison logic and directly handles the case where the `target_as_index` is an IntervalIndex. It checks if the two indexes are equal and returns the appropriate indexer based on the comparison result.

By making these changes, the corrected function should be able to pass the failing test.
