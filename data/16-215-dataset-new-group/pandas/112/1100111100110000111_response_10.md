## Analyzing the buggy function and related functions
The buggy function is `get_indexer()` in the `IntervalIndex` class. It is overloaded with another function with different argument types.

The related functions called within `get_indexer()` include `ensure_index()` and `find_common_type()`.

The error message indicates a "TypeError: No matching signature found" from the file `pandas/_libs/intervaltree.pxi`.

The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the `round` method fails when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.


## Identifying the potential error locations within the buggy function
The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the overloaded method causing confusion and the incorrect argument types for `get_indexer()`.


## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the overloaded method `get_indexer()` which is causing confusion for method resolution. This results in a "TypeError: No matching signature found" when calling `get_indexer()` with a `CategoricalIndex` as an argument.

The error occurs because when a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` is passed to `get_indexer()`, it ends up calling the wrong method due to the overridden `get_indexer()` method.


## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to differentiate between the two `get_indexer()` methods and ensure that the correct method is being called based on the type of input. We should also ensure that the correct method signature is being used with the correct argument types.


## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged as it appears to be correct
            # ...
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping` method is changed to `self.is_overlapping()`, and the method signature is correctly used within the function. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
