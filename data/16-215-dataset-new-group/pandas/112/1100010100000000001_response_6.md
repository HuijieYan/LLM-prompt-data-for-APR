The buggy function is the `get_indexer` function from the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `if self.is_overlapping` condition may not be properly handling the case when `self.is_overlapping` is `True`.
2. The conditional block for `isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex)` may not be working as expected.
3. The logic for `left_indexer` and `right_indexer` assignment within the conditional block could be incorrect.

The cause of the bug using the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the different cases when dealing with overlapping indices, different closed or incompatible subtypes, or non-overlapping indices.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to reevaluate the condition and logic within the `get_indexer` function to ensure that it properly handles all the different cases and edge cases related to indices and their types.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    method = method or "pad"  # Assume a default method if not provided

    if method not in ("pad", "ffill", "backfill", "bfill"):
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "The method argument other than the default of None is not yet implemented."
        )

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case when target_as_index is an IntervalIndex
        result = self._get_indexer_interval(target_as_index)
    else:
        # Handle the case when target_as_index is not an IntervalIndex
        result = self._get_indexer_generic(target_as_index, method=method)

    return ensure_platform_int(result)
```
