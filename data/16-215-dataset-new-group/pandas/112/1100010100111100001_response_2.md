The error message suggests that the `get_indexer` function is encountering a `TypeError` with no matching signature found. This indicates that there is an issue with how the function is being called or with the types of parameters being passed to it.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function and the failing test case, it appears that the `get_indexer` function is being called with the parameter `target_as_index.values`, which is expected to be of type `scalar_t[:]`. However, it seems that the type of `target_as_index.values` is not compatible with the expected type, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the type of `target_as_index.values` matches the expected type `scalar_t[:]`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # (existing code...)

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer_scalar(target_as_index)
    else:
        # (existing code...)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` call with `self._engine.get_indexer_scalar(target_as_index)` to ensure that the correct type is passed to the `get_indexer` function.

By making this change, we ensure that the correct type of data is being passed to the `get_indexer` function, resolving the `TypeError` and fixing the bug.
