The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is designed to return an indexer (array of integers) that can be used to align the intervals represented by the `IntervalIndex` with another array-like object.

The error message indicates a "TypeError" with no matching signature found, which suggests that there is a mismatch between the expected input and the actual input to a method or function.

An analysis of the runtime values and types of the input parameters and relevant variables reveals the following:
- The input parameters `self` and `target` are both `IntervalIndex` objects containing intervals with closed boundaries on the right side.
- The `target_as_index` variable is derived from ensuring that the `target` input is an index, and it also contains intervals with closed boundaries on the right side.

From the runtime values, it appears that the function is appropriately handling the `IntervalIndex` objects and their properties.

The error occurs at the line `indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`, where the `_engine` object's `get_indexer` method is being called with the `values` attribute of the `target_as_index` object as the input. The error message suggests that there is a mismatch in the signature of this method.

To fix this bug, it may be necessary to review the implementation of the `_engine` class and its `get_indexer` method to ensure that it can handle the input provided. It's possible that the `get_indexer` method is not designed to accept an `IntervalArray` object as the input or that there is a problem with how the `IntervalArray` object is being passed to it.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # ...
        # (The rest of the original implementation)
        # ...

    # Check if the target is an IntervalArray
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalArray):
        indexer = np.zeros(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
        for i, interval in enumerate(target_as_index):
            # Match the interval with the self IntervalIndex
            for j, self_interval in enumerate(self):
                if interval == self_interval:
                    indexer[i] = j
                    break
                elif interval.overlaps(self_interval):
                    msg = (
                        "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                        "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
                    )
                    raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        return indexer
    else:
        # Handle other cases, such as scalar indexes
        indexer = np.zeros(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
        for i, value in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(value)
                indexer[i] = loc
            except KeyError:
                indexer[i] = -1
        return indexer
```

In this corrected version, the function handles the case where the `target` is an `IntervalArray` separately by iterating through its intervals and matching them with the intervals in the `IntervalIndex` object. If an overlap is found, it raises an `InvalidIndexError` with an appropriate message. If the target is a scalar index, it uses the `get_loc` method to find the corresponding positions.

This corrected implementation should resolve the TypeError issue and allow the function to handle `IntervalArray` inputs appropriately. It should also align with the intended behavior of the `get_indexer` function.
