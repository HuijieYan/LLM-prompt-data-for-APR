To fix the buggy function, we need to carefully analyze the given function and its related code. The failing test and the corresponding error message indicate that there is a type error when calling the `get_indexer` function, which is using the `self._engine.get_indexer` method with `target_as_index.values`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the method signature or data type compatibility.

The error message indicates a type error with no matching signature found:
```
TypeError: No matching signature found
```

To resolve this issue:
- We need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function has the correct method signature and can handle the input data type correctly.
- Check for any potential data type mismatches or inconsistencies in the code that could lead to this type error.

Based on the GitHub issue, it appears that the problem arises when using `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex`. We need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle this scenario properly.

Given the information provided, here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.indexes.base import ensure_index

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        # For scalar index, use the IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)

```

In this corrected version:
- We have fixed the condition `if self.is_overlapping` to `if self.is_overlapping()` to ensure that it's being called as a method and not a property.
- We have added an extra `else` block to handle other cases where the input `target_as_index` is not an `IntervalIndex`.
- We also ensure that the input data types are handled correctly, and the method signature is appropriate for the given parameters.

By making these changes, we aim to resolve the type error issue and ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle various scenarios, including when using a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the `get_indexer` method works correctly in the given scenarios.
