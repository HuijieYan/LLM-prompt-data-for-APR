The issue is related to the `round` method failing when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The issue mentions that the `round` method works when the columns are of type `IntervalIndex`, but it fails when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex`.

The buggy function in the provided source code is the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. Upon analysis, it's clear that the bug is related to the handling of non-overlapping indexes and the conversion of indexes to `IntervalTree`.

To fix this issue, it is essential to handle the `CategoricalIndex` type scenario correctly in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, when the target is of type `CategoricalIndex`, there should be a specific logic to handle this case.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # logic for handling IntervalIndex
        # (unchanged from the original implementation)
        pass
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # logic for handling other index types
        # (unchanged from the original implementation)
        pass
    else:
        # logic for handling heterogeneous scalar index types
        # (unchanged from the original implementation)
        pass

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a specific block to handle the case when the target is of type `CategoricalIndex`. In this case, we simply return an indexer with an array of integers.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `round` method works as expected even when columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
