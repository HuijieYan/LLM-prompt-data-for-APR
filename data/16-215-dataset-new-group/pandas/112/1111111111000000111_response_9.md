Based on the provided information and the buggy function, it appears that the issue lies in the implementation of the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. The problem arises when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, causing the `round` method to fail.

The buggy function `get_indexer` should be modified to handle the case when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. Specifically, the conditional branching within the `get_indexer` function needs to be updated to appropriately handle this case.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the conditional branching within the `get_indexer` function to include proper handling for `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, ensuring that the `round` method behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
...
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            indexers = [self.get_indexer(sub_target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance) for sub_target in target_as_index.codes]
            return np.array(indexers)
        ...
        
```

In this corrected version, when the `target_as_index` is of type `CategoricalIndex` and its categories are of type `IntervalIndex`, the function will retrieve the indexers for each category using a list comprehension.

By making this change, the `get_indexer` function should now handle the case when columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, allowing the `round` method to work as expected. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
