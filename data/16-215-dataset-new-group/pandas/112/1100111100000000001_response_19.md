The buggy function seems to be the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas` library. The purpose of this function is to return an indexer that shows how to reindex a particular target object to the interval index. The error is likely occurring in the part of the function where it handles overlapping indexes.

The potential causes of the bug could be:
1. The conditional check `if self.is_overlapping` is missing parentheses, which means it's checking the truthiness of the `is_overlapping` method rather than calling it.
2. There is a potential bug in the section of the code that handles overlapping indices, where the error is explicitly raised.

To fix the bug, the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping` should be corrected to `if self.is_overlapping()` with parentheses so that it calls the method rather than checking its truthiness.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In this corrected version, the `self.is_overlapping` method call has been modified to `self.is_overlapping()` with parentheses. This will correctly call the method and check the value returned.
