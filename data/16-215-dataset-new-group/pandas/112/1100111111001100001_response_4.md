The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of the `IntervalIndex` objects and their comparison with the `target_as_index` object. The function is attempting to compare the properties of the `IntervalIndex` objects and perform operations based on the comparison results, but it seems to be encountering issues with this logic.

The function should compare the properties of `self` and `target_as_index` objects and perform appropriate operations based on the comparison results. It should also handle the case where the `target_as_index` is a scalar index.

There are a few potential error locations within the function:
1. Comparison of properties of `IntervalIndex` objects (`self` and `target_as_index`) may not be handled correctly.
2. Handling of `target_as_index` when it is a scalar index may not be implemented correctly.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function is not correctly handling the comparison of properties of `IntervalIndex` objects and their corresponding operations.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly compare the properties of the `IntervalIndex` objects and implement appropriate operations based on the comparison results. It should also handle the case where the `target_as_index` is a scalar index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        else:
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the bug is fixed by correctly calling the `is_overlapping()` method with parentheses to evaluate the boolean result. Additionally, the handling of `target_as_index` when it is not an `IntervalIndex` is adjusted to call the `_engine()` method and also ensure the output is converted to the appropriate integer type.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
