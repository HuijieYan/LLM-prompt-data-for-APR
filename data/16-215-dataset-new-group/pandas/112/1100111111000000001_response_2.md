The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is failing due to the use of the `is_overlapping` attribute as a condition instead of a method call. Since `is_overlapping` is a method, it should be called as `self.is_overlapping()` instead of just `self.is_overlapping`.

To fix this bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called with parentheses to invoke its functionality.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Fix: call the 'is_overlapping' method
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

After making this fix, the function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
