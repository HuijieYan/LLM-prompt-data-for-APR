The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the logic for handling the target index when it is of type `IntervalIndex`. The code appears to be comparing and manipulating the left and right endpoints of the intervals, but it is not producing the correct results. 

One potential cause of the bug could be related to the equality comparison and manipulation of the `left_indexer` and `right_indexer` arrays. It's also possible that the handling of overlapping indices is not correctly implemented.

To fix this bug, the code should be revised to ensure that the comparison and manipulation of the left and right endpoints of the intervals are correct, and that the handling of overlapping indices is implemented properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='intp')
        for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                indexer[i] = loc
            except KeyError:
                indexer[i] = -1

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping` function is called as a method (i.e., `self.is_overlapping()`), which should correctly return the boolean value indicating whether the intervals are overlapping.

Additionally, the logic for comparing and manipulating the left and right endpoints of the intervals should produce the correct results.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
