The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the comparison of IntervalIndex objects. The function is failing to correctly match intervals in the target index with intervals in the self index.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison between intervals is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for comparing IntervalIndex objects and matching intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            indexer = np.full(len(target_as_index), -1, dtype=int)
            for i, target_interval in enumerate(target_as_index):
                for j, self_interval in enumerate(self):
                    if target_interval == self_interval:
                        indexer[i] = j
                        break
        else:
            indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
        
        return indexer
```

This corrected version compares each interval in the target index with each interval in the self index and assigns the matching index positions to the result. If there is no match, the result index is set to -1. This should correctly handle the comparison and indexing of intervals in the target and self indexes.

Make sure to test this corrected version with the failing test to ensure that it now passes.
