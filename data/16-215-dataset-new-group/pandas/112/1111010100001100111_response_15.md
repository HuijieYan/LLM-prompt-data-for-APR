The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to how it handles the `target_as_index` variable when `is_object_dtype(target_as_index)` is True. It appears that the function is not handling the non-overlapping case properly and is returning an empty list instead of the expected indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that deals with `target_as_index` when it is an object dtype. We need to ensure that the indexer is being populated correctly for heterogeneous scalar indexes.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code for handling IntervalIndex
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='intp')
            for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                    indexer[i] = loc
                except KeyError:
                    indexer[i] = -1

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the `indexer` is properly populated for heterogeneous scalar indexes, and the function should now handle the case where `target_as_index` is an object dtype correctly.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub, as it addresses the handling of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex and ensures that `round` method works as expected.
