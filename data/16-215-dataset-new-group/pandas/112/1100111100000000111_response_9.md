The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is raising an `InvalidIndexError` when `self.is_overlapping` is true. This behavior is likely incorrect and causing issues with the `round` method for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to correctly handle the overlapping case and provide the expected behavior for the `round` method for `CategoricalIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        # Corrected condition to handle overlapping case
        if self.is_overlapping():
            return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the code remains the same
            # ...
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # Rest of the code remains the same
            # ...
        else:
            # Rest of the code remains the same
            # ...

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The correction involves using `self.is_overlapping()` as the condition instead of `self.is_overlapping` and providing a fallback method using `get_indexer_non_unique` to handle the overlapping case.

By making this change, the behavior of the `get_indexer` function for `IntervalIndex` should respect the expected behavior of the `round` method for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, as described in the GitHub issue.
