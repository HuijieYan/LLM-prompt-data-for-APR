The potential error is likely in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found". This suggests there is an issue with the type signature of the function.

The bug is likely caused by an incorrect type signature within the `get_indexer` function. The function signature is expecting a `scalar_t[:]` type for the `target` parameter, but it seems that the actual type of `target_as_index.values` is an `IntervalArray`. This mismatch is likely causing the `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, the type signature for the `target` parameter in the `get_indexer` function should be adjusted to accept an `IntervalArray` type.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: Union[AnyArrayLike, IntervalArray],
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By accepting either `AnyArrayLike` or `IntervalArray` for the `target` parameter, the function should now be able to handle the input correctly.
