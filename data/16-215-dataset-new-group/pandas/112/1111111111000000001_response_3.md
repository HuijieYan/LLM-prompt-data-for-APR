The buggy function `get_indexer` is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas` library. The defined function is responsible for indexing the intervals within the `IntervalIndex` object. It contains several conditional and looping constructs to handle different types of indexes and their corresponding intervals.

The potential error location within the function is in the conditional block that handles `IntervalIndex` instances and their overlapping intervals. This part of the code raises an `InvalidIndexError` if the `IntervalIndex` contains overlapping intervals, but the condition to check for overlapping intervals is not correctly implemented, leading to the incorrect raising of the exception.

The cause of the bug is that the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is missing the function call. It should be `if self.is_overlapping():` as `is_overlapping` is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class rather than a property.

To fix the bug, this condition should correctly check for overlapping intervals using the `is_overlapping` method. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the indexing and comparison operations handle all possible index and interval cases properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
    ...
    ...
```

This change ensures that the `is_overlapping` method is called correctly, and the function should now handle the cases of overlapping intervals as intended. After making this correction, the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` should pass successfully.
