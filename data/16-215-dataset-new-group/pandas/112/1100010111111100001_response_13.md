Based on the error message and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, the TypeError is being caused by the `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` call. The `target_as_index.values` seems to be of type `IntervalArray`, which is not compatible with the `get_indexer` method signature, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `target_as_index.values` is converted to a compatible type that can be used with the `get_indexer` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code unchanged

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # remaining code unchanged
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    else:
        # remaining code unchanged

    return indexer
```

In the corrected version, we have added the conversion of the `target_as_index.values` to a compatible type using the `_maybe_convert_i8` method before passing it to the `_engine.get_indexer` method. This should resolve the TypeError and make the function work as expected.
