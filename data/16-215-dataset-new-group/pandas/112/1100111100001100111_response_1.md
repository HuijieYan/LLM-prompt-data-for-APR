The buggy function identified above is `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The function is intended to return an indexer array that can be used to index into the target array. The GitHub issue highlights a problem with the `round` method when dealing with columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The bug in the `get_indexer` function appears to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex types and the interaction with CategoricalIndex. The function fails to handle the conversion and indexing correctly, leading to unexpected errors, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of different Index types, particularly when the input target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. The function does not account for this conversion and fails to perform the indexing as expected.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `get_indexer` function properly handles the different types of Index objects, including IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex. This may involve implementing specific logic to handle the conversion from IntervalIndex to CategoricalIndex and then performing the indexing operation accordingly.

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.category import CategoricalIndex

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # Check the method
    self._check_method(method)

    # Handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target = target.categories

    # Rest of the code remains the same as the original function

    # ... (rest of the code unchanged)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If so, we extract the underlying IntervalIndex to handle the indexing correctly. This approach addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By implementing this fix, the `get_indexer` function should now handle the conversion from IntervalIndex to CategoricalIndex and perform the indexing operation as expected, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug.
