This bug is related to the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class in pandas. The failing test is due to a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found" when trying to call `get_indexer`.

The bug is caused by an incorrect method signature definition in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The `get_indexer` method is expecting an argument of type `scalar_t[:] target`, which is a NumPy array of scalar values, but it's being called with a CategoricalIndex.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the method signature and implementation of the `get_indexer` method to handle the case of a CategoricalIndex containing IntervalIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the method implementation remains the same
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the `target` is a CategoricalIndex and extracts the categories from it. Then, the rest of the method implementation remains the same.

This modification should fix the bug and allow the `round` method to work properly when the columns are of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
