The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class. The function fails due to an error in the logic for handling overlapping indices. When the `is_overlapping` attribute is True, the function is supposed to raise an `InvalidIndexError`. However, the error is not raised, resulting in incorrect behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the condition "if self.is_overlapping:" is using the property `is_overlapping` directly instead of calling the function `is_overlapping()`. This causes the condition to always be True, leading to the incorrect handling of overlapping indices.

To fix the bug, the condition "if self.is_overlapping:" needs to be changed to "if self.is_overlapping():". This will ensure that the `is_overlapping()` function is called to check for overlapping indices and handle them correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains the same...
```

With this change, the `get_indexer` function should now handle overlapping indices correctly and pass the failing test.
