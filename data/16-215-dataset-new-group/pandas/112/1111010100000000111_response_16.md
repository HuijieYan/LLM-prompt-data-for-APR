The buggy function in the `IntervalIndex` class is the `get_indexer` method. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the `round` method failing when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. When handling the case for `IntervalIndex` and checking for common subtype, there might be an issue with the comparison logic for the subtype and closed intervals.
2. Additionally, the method does not handle the case when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, which might be the reason for the `TypeError: No matching signature found` reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method is not handling the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly, leading to the failure of the `round` method in such cases.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to add a conditional check to handle the case when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and ensure that the logic for handling common subtype and closed intervals is correct.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            return target_as_index.codes
        
        # ... (rest of the method remains the same)
```

In the corrected version, a conditional check is added to handle the case when the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. In this case, the method returns the `codes` attribute of the `CategoricalIndex`, which resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
