The issue may be related to the handling of the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in the round method. It is likely that the bug exists in the implementation of the get_indexer function in the IntervalIndex class, causing the round method to fail when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the related functions and classes, as well as the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug may be related to the implementation of the get_indexer function in the IntervalIndex class. The function may not properly handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a failure in the round method when such columns are encountered.

To fix the bug, we should carefully inspect the logic within the get_indexer function and ensure that it appropriately handles the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# your corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex
        indexer = self.get_indexer_for_categorical(target_as_index)
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case where the target is an IntervalIndex
        indexer = self.get_indexer_for_interval(target_as_index)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Handle other cases
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # Handle other cases
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have added specific handling for the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex by introducing a new function get_indexer_for_categorical. This new function should appropriately handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex to ensure that the round method works as expected.

By updating the logic in the get_indexer function to properly handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the bug should be resolved, and the round method should work as normal for such columns.
