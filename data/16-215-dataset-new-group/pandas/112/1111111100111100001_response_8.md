Based on the error message and the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the issue lies in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` and mentions that no matching signature was found. This suggests that there might be a mismatch between the argument types and the expected signature of the method.

Upon analyzing the input and output values, it seems that the `get_indexer` method encounters an issue when attempting to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. It's possible that the `get_indexer` method is not being called with the correct arguments or that the method itself has an incorrect signature.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is called with the correct arguments and that its signature matches the expected requirements. We should also check the implementation of the method to ensure that it correctly handles the provided arguments.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index], dtype=np.intp)
    
    return indexer
```

In this corrected version, we've made sure to call the `is_overlapping` method with parentheses `self.is_overlapping()` to properly evaluate its value. We also adjusted the handling of the `target_as_index` argument and made modifications to the conditional branches to ensure that the appropriate indexing behavior is applied.

This corrected version should resolve the issues and pass the failing test.
