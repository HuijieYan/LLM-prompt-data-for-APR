The bug in the `get_indexer` function is that it is using the `self.is_overlapping` attribute without calling it as a method. It should be called as `self.is_overlapping()`. Currently, it's being used as a property. 

To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called rather than the attribute itself. This may require providing any necessary arguments to the `is_overlapping` method depending on its implementation.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the get_indexer function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping` method is properly called with parentheses, indicating that it is a method of the class `IntervalIndex` and not a property.
