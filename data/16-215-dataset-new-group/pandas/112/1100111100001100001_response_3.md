The bug in the code seems to be related to the logic of comparing and indexing interval indexes. Based on the provided code and runtime input/output values, it is clear that the issue lies in the comparison of interval indexes and the generation of the indexer array.

The problem seems to be with the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` where the original code is checking the condition instead of invoking the method `self.is_overlapping()`.

To fix the bug, the following approach is suggested:
- Modify the code to call the method `self.is_overlapping()` instead of directly accessing the attribute `self.is_overlapping`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By making this simple change, the buggy function should work as intended and correctly compare the interval indexes.
