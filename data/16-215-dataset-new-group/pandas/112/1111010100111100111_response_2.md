## Explanation:

The bug occurs when the `round` method is used on a DataFrame with columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The `round` method fails with a TypeError, indicating that no matching signature is found. This bug is related to the internal `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class, which is being called when the `round` method is invoked.

Upon analysis of the code, the issue seems to be related to the usage of `target_as_index.values` in the `get_indexer` method. The `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` object, and when its `values` attribute is accessed, it returns an `IntervalArray` object. It seems that the underlying implementation of the `get_indexer` method does not handle the `IntervalArray` type properly, leading to the TypeError.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- The `get_indexer` method should be modified to handle `IntervalArray` objects appropriately and ensure that a matching signature is found when called within the `round` method.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the code remains the same as it was originally
    
    # Handling when target_as_index type is not IntervalIndex
    else:
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version, when the `target_as_index` type is not an `IntervalIndex` object, it is assumed to be a homogeneous scalar index, and the `IntervalTree` is used to get the indexer. This should ensure that the `get_indexer` method handles the `target_as_index` appropriately.
