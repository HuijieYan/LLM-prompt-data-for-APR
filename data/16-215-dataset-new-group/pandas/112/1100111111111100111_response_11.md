## Correction:

```python
# It appears that the get_indexer method is being overridden in the `IntervalIndex` class. To fix the bug, we need to remove the overridden get_indexer method from the `IntervalIndex` class to ensure that the default implementation from the Index class is used. 

# We should remove the get_indexer method from the IntervalIndex class as it's causing conflicts with the default implementation.

# The corrected version of the buggy function:

# Remove the overridden get_indexer method from the IntervalIndex class
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    def _engine(self):
        pass

    def left(self):
        pass

    def right(self):
        pass

    def closed(self):
        pass

    def values(self):
        pass

    def dtype(self):
        pass

    def is_overlapping(self):
        pass

    def _maybe_convert_i8(self, key):
        pass

    def _check_method(self, method):
        pass

    # Remove the overridden get_indexer method
    # def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:
    #     pass

    def where(self, cond, other=None):
        pass

    def equals(self, other) -> bool:
        pass
```
With this correction, the default implementation of the get_indexer method from the Index class should be used, resolving the conflict and fixing the bug.
