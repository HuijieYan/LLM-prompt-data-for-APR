The buggy code includes the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message from the failing test indicates a TypeError with no matching signature found when calling the `get_indexer` method.

Upon reviewing the `get_indexer` method, it seems that the issue might be related to the signature and possibly a missing or incorrect decorator.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method should be modified to ensure that the signature and decorators are correctly defined.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# Other imports and class definitions remain unchanged
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):

    # Existing class methods and attributes remain unchanged

    # Corrected get_indexer method
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # same as before
            # ...
        else:
            # same as before
            # ...

        return np.asarray(indexer, dtype=np.intp)
```

In the corrected version, the method signature and type hints are correctly defined, and the return type is explicitly cast using `np.asarray` to ensure consistency.

By correcting the method signature and return type, the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method should solve the TypeError issue and pass the failing test.
