## Analysis
The function `get_indexer` is taking `target` as input and performing various operations based on the type of `target`. It then returns the indexer based on the operations performed.

## Identified potential error locations
1. The use of `is_overlapping` could potentially cause an error if not defined correctly.
2. `find_common_type` might return an unexpected result.
3. The handling of different data types of `target` could lead to unexpected behavior.

## Explanation of the bug
The `get_indexer` function is not handling all possible cases and the mentioned variables are not defined within the function, which may result in NameError or unexpected behavior.

## Suggestions for fixing the bug
1. Define the variable `is_overlapping` and handle it appropriately within the function.
2. Use type checking and handle different data types of `target` more gracefully.
3. Ensure that `find_common_type` is providing the correct common type for comparison.

```

In the corrected version, the potential errors were addressed by defining the variable `is_overlapping` and handling it appropriately, and by using type checking to handle different data types of `target` more gracefully. The `find_common_type` issue was not specifically addressed in the corrected version as it's unclear from the original code whether it would cause a bug. If `find_common_type` is also causing issues, it should be handled appropriately as well.
