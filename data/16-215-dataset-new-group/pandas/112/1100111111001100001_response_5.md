The buggy function `get_indexer` is checking for overlapping indices and handling different scenarios based on the type and properties of the intervals. 

Based on the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables right before the function's return, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the case where `self.is_overlapping` is False.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could include:
1. Reviewing the logic for handling non-overlapping indices and ensuring that it is correctly implemented.
2. Verifying that the comparisons and checks for equality between different IntervalIndex instances are accurately performed.
3. Checking for any potential errors in the code related to the manipulation of IntervalIndex properties such as left, right, and closed.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the is_overlapping method is called as a function to ensure that the correct Boolean value is used for condition checking. Additionally, I've adjusted the logic for handling different scenarios based on the type and properties of the intervals. This should address the potential issues causing the failing test.
