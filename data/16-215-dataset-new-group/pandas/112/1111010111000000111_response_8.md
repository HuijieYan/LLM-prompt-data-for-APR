Based on the provided information, it appears that the issue lies in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The failing test case involves using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The problem description indicates that this combination results in a TypeError, instead of rounding as expected.

The cause of the bug is likely related to a mishandling of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` in the implementation of the `get_indexer` function. This could be due to compatibility issues or incorrect handling of the data type within the function.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing how the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` is handled within the `get_indexer` function. It may require updating the logic to properly handle this specific case, ensuring compatibility and correct data type handling.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function which should resolve the bug:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
        else:
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In this corrected version, we remove the specific handling for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and delegate the indexing operation to the superclass implementation using `super().get_indexer()`. This should allow for proper handling of the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and ensure that the rounding method works as expected in the failing test case.
