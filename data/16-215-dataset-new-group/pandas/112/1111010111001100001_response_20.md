The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be causing issues when handling the `IntervalIndex` objects. This is evident from the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` which creates a `DataFrame` with columns of type `pd.CategoricalIndex` containing interval ranges. The expected result of rounding the DataFrame is not being achieved, indicating a problem with the `get_indexer` function.

The bug appears to be related to the comparison and matching of interval indices, as well as the handling of different types of index values.

One potential cause of the bug is the incorrect comparison of interval indices and the handling of overlapping indices.

To fix the bug, it may be necessary to revisit the logic for comparing and matching interval indices and ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the type and properties of the indices.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        indexer = np.zeros(len(target_as_index), dtype=int)
        for i in range(len(self)):
            overlap = target_as_index.overlaps(self[i])
            indexer[overlap] = i

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we have made changes to the interval matching logic to ensure that the correct positional matches are identified based on overlapping intervals. We have also streamlined the handling of different types of index values, ensuring that the correct operations are performed based on the type and properties of the indices.
