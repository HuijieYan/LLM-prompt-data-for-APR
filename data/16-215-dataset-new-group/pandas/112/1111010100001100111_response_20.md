Upon analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is related to the use of IntervalIndex with CategoricalIndex in the pandas DataFrame when applying the `round()` method.

The bug in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class seems to be related to handling overlapping indices. When IntervalIndex is used with the `round()` method on a DataFrame containing CategoricalIndex, it fails to handle the types correctly, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to round the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` function to correctly handle overlapping indices when IntervalIndex is used with CategoricalIndex in a DataFrame.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # New implementation to handle overlapping indices when used with CategoricalIndex
    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This correction will ensure that when IntervalIndex is used with CategoricalIndex, the `get_indexer` function correctly handles overlapping indices, resolving the issue with the `round()` method on a DataFrame containing CategoricalIndex.
