The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` is causing a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when called by the `test_round_interval_category_columns` test function in `pandas/tests/frame/test_analytics.py`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect usage or implementation of the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class. It seems that the signature of the `get_indexer` method does not match the expected signature, leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class needs to be corrected to ensure that it accepts the correct input types and returns the expected output type. This may involve updating the method signature and ensuring proper type compatibility for the input `target` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# Corrected version of the get_indexer method
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
        # ...
    else:
        # Rest of the logic remains unchanged
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `is_overlapping()` method is called as a function (`self.is_overlapping()`) instead of a property (`self.is_overlapping`).
- The if-else logic handling different target types is preserved.

After applying these changes, the corrected `get_indexer` method should pass the failing test.
