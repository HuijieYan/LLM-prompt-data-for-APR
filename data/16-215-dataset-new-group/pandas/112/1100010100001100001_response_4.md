Based on the provided information, it seems that the buggy function is supposed to handle IntervalIndex objects and perform various operations on them. However, there are potential issues in the code, and the function may fail to execute as expected. 

The identified potential issues in the code are as follows:
1. The check for overlapping indices may not be working correctly.
2. The logic for handling different types of target indices could lead to unexpected results.
3. The handling of the target_as_index variable in different branches of the code may not be consistent.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to:
1. Ensure that the check for overlapping indices is correctly implemented and does not raise errors unnecessarily.
2. Review the logic for handling different types of target indices and ensure it is functioning as intended.
3. Verify that the handling of the target_as_index variable is consistent throughout the function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:  # Correcting the condition for checking overlapping indices
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key, method=method) for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the condition for handling overlapping indices has been modified, and the logic for handling different types of target indices has been simplified to ensure consistency. Additionally, the get_indexer_non_unique method is called if the indices are overlapping.
