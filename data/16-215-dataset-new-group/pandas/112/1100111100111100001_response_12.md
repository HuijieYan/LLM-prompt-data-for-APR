The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the way it handles overlapping indices. 

Upon reviewing the input values and types, it appears that the `get_indexer` function is expecting an array-like input `target` of the same type as `self`, which is an `IntervalIndex`. However, when checking for overlaps with `self.is_overlapping`, the condition is not correctly evaluating whether the input `target` overlaps with `self`.

Another issue is that the function is trying to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` without considering the type or structure of `self._engine` and whether it has a `get_indexer` method.

To fix the bug:
1. Verify that the comparison for overlapping indices (`self.is_overlapping`) is correctly evaluating whether the input `target` overlaps with `self`.
2. Check if `self._engine` has a `get_indexer` method before attempting to call it.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # the rest of the logic remains unchanged

        # Check if self._engine has a get_indexer method
        if hasattr(self._engine, 'get_indexer'):
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Method get_indexer not implemented in _engine")

    else:
        # the rest of the logic remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this fixed version:
- `self.is_overlapping` is now called as a method `self.is_overlapping()`.
- We check if `self._engine` has a `get_indexer` method before attempting to use it.

This should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
