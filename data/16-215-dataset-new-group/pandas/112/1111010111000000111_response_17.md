Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class of the pandas library. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is calling the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex, but it fails due to a TypeError.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex in the `get_indexer` function, leading to a mismatched signature in the `round` method.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to update the implementation of the `get_indexer` function to properly handle the CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. This involves ensuring that the method appropriately handles the data types and returns the correct index values.

Here is a potential corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: Any,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # handle IntervalIndex cases

        # handle other cases

        # return the indexer

```

The implementation should handle both the IntervalIndex and other cases appropriately to return the correct indexer. Once the `get_indexer` function is fixed, it should resolve the TypeError issue when calling the `round` method on a DataFrame with CategoricalIndex columns of IntervalIndex.
