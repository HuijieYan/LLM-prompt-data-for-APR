The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the comparison of IntervalIndexes and the detection of overlapping indices. Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the self IntervalIndex and the target IntervalIndex are equal. If they are equal, return the positional match.
2. If they are not equal, check if the closed attribute or the subtype of the two IntervalIndexes are incompatible. If either condition is true, return -1 for each element in the target IntervalIndex.
3. If the above conditions are not met, check for overlapping intervals and calculate the index accordingly.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and relevant variables, here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.equals(target):
        return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
    if self.closed != target.closed or is_object_dtype(find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target.dtype.subtype])):
        return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target))

    # Calculate the index for non-overlapping intervals
    left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target.left)
    right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target.right)
    indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version handles the condition where the two IntervalIndexes are equal, the condition where their closed attributes or subtypes are incompatible, and the calculation of the index for non-overlapping intervals.
