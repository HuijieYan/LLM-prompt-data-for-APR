The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `get_indexer` method. Specifically, the error message "TypeError: No matching signature found" indicates that there is an issue with the function signature or the input arguments.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to review the function signature and ensure that the input arguments are correctly specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # (unchanged code)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # (unchanged code)
    else:
        # (unchanged code)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the key change is the addition of parentheses after `self.is_overlapping` in the conditional statement. This ensures that the `is_overlapping` function is executed to retrieve the boolean value, which is necessary for the conditional logic to work as expected.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test.
