Based on the error message from the failing test and the GitHub issue, it appears that the `get_indexer` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file is causing the bug. The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found`, which suggests that there is a mismatch in function signatures or method arguments.

The GitHub issue also provides a clear description of the problem, which occurs when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The expected output is for the `round` method to work as normal.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This may involve modifying the method arguments or signatures to handle this specific case.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    indexer = []
    
    for key in target_as_index:
        try:
            loc = self.get_loc(key)
        except KeyError:
            loc = -1
        indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function, the code has been simplified to handle the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` by directly iterating over the `target_as_index` and retrieving the location using `get_loc`. This ensures that the method can handle this specific case correctly.

With this corrected version of the function, the `round` method should work as expected on a DataFrame with columns that are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
