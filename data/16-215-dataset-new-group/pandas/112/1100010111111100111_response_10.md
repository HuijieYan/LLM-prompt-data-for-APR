To fix the bug, it seems that the issue is related to the `CategoricalIndex` being used in the `round` method. Based on the error message and the failing test, it appears that the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class is not handling the `CategoricalIndex` properly, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The potential error location within the buggy function is when handling the `CategoricalIndex` as the target input.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method is not properly handling the `CategoricalIndex` as the target input, which is leading to the `TypeError` when calling the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, modify the logic in the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the case when the target input is a `CategoricalIndex`, ensuring that the method does not result in a `TypeError` when calling the `round` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.as_index()

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `get_indexer` method properly handles the case when the target input is a `CategoricalIndex` by converting it to an `Index` type using the `as_index` method. This modification should address the `TypeError` issue and make the `round` method work correctly with `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
