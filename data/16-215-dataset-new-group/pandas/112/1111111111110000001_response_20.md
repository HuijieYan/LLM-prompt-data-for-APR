Based on the error message, it seems that the `TypeError: No matching signature found` is related to the `get_indexer` function in the `intervaltree.pxi` file. This typically occurs when the function signature or arguments passed to the function do not match what is expected.

Looking at the buggy function, the `get_indexer` function is being called within the conditional branches based on the type of the `target_as_index`. It's possible that the issue lies in how the `target_as_index` is being passed to the `get_indexer` function, or how the return type of the `get_indexer` function is handled.

To fix the bug, you would need to carefully inspect the conditional branches where `get_indexer` is called and ensure that the arguments passed match the expected signature, and that the return type is appropriately handled.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='int64')
        for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer[i] = loc

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version:
- We added parentheses `()` to the call to `self.is_overlapping()` as it seems to be a method.
- Modified the condition for checking overlap to `self.is_overlapping()` to ensure that it is called as a method.
- Changed the calls to `self.left` and `self.right` as `self.left()` and `self.right()` respectively to ensure that these are being called as methods.
- For the last conditional branch, we used an empty numpy array to store the indexers and iterated over the target_as_index, populating the indexer based on the return values from the `get_loc` method.

Please replace the existing `get_indexer` function with this corrected version and run the failing test again to verify if the bug is fixed.
