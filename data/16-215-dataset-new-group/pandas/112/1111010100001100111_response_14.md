The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for non-object `target_as_index` in the `get_indexer` method.
2. The conditional statements comparing the equality of different closed or incompatible subtypes in the `get_indexer` method.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `get_indexer` method handles the indexing of `IntervalIndex` objects. The function has conditional logic for different scenarios when dealing with `target_as_index`, but it may not be handling all possible cases leading to incorrect behavior. This bug could be related to the failure of the `round` method when using CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex, as reported in the GitHub issue, which indicates that there is an issue with handling IntervalIndex within the code.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to thoroughly review and refactor the conditional logic in the `get_indexer` method to cover all possible cases and handle them appropriately. It's also important to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is consistent with the behavior expected from the IntervalIndex objects.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Index types do not match for get_indexer")

    if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The corrected version simplifies the conditional logic, removes unnecessary comparisons, and focuses on appropriately handling the different index scenarios. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
