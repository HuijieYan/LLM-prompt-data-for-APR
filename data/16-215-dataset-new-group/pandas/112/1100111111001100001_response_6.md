The bug in the provided code seems to be with the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class. 

After analyzing the failing test case and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue arises when the `get_indexer` function is called with overlapping intervals. The code is not able to handle overlapping indices and raises a `InvalidIndexError`.

The bug can be fixed by implementing a condition to handle overlapping indices and return the appropriate result.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
    else:
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping` function is called as a method to determine if the intervals are overlapping, and the result is used to return the appropriate indexer array.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` passes successfully.
