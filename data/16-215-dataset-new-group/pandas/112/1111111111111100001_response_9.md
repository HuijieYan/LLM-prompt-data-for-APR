The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be caused by the incorrect implementation when handling the `IntervalIndex` instances. It fails to properly handle overlapping indices and non-matching intervals, leading to a `TypeError` during execution.

The problem seems to be related to how the function fails to properly handle the potential cases for overlapping and non-matching intervals. Additionally, it fails to account for the specific implementation details of the `IntervalIndex` class.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle overlapping indices and non-matching intervals in the `IntervalIndex`. It should also ensure that the implementation is consistent with the specific requirements and behaviors of the `IntervalIndex` class.

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

    # ... (Other cases)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The fixed version of the `get_indexer` function should properly handle overlapping indices as well as non-matching intervals, and ensure that the implementation is consistent with the specific requirements and behaviors of the `IntervalIndex` class. This should address the `TypeError` issue and allow the failing test to pass.
