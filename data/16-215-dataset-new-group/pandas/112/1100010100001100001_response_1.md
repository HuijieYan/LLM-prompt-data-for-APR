The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` seems to be related to a failure to properly handle IntervalIndex objects during the comparison and indexing process. The function appears to be checking for equal indexes and handling different closed or incompatible subtypes, but it may not be handling all cases correctly.

The bug is likely causing issues during the comparison of IntervalIndex objects, leading to incorrect results or errors in the return value of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison and indexing process for IntervalIndex objects is handled correctly, taking into account cases where the indexes are equal, have different closed settings, or have different subtypes. Additionally, the handling of scalar indexes, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, needs to be verified and potentially revised.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # Check for different closed or incompatible subtype
        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # Non-overlapping case
        indexer = np.searchsorted(self, target_as_index, side='left')

    elif not is_list_like(target_as_index):
        # Scalar index case
        indexer = np.searchsorted(self, target_as_index, side='left')

    else:
        # Heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of IntervalIndex comparison and indexing has been revised to ensure that it covers the different cases, including equal indexes, different closed settings, and different subtypes. The handling of scalar indexes, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, has also been modified to use `np.searchsorted` for comparison and indexing.

This corrected version should address the issues related to comparing and indexing IntervalIndex objects and provide the expected results for different input scenarios.
