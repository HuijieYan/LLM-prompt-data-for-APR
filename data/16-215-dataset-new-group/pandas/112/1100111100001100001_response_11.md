The buggy function is `get_indexer` and it is part of the `IntervalIndex` class in the pandas library. This function is responsible for returning an indexer array that can be used to align the values of another index with the intervals in the `IntervalIndex`.

The bug in the code seems to be related to the condition `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):`. When checking if the target is also an `IntervalIndex`, the function is trying to handle three cases: when the indexes are the same, when they are different, and when they are overlapping. The logic to handle these cases is incorrect, leading to incorrect return values.

The strategy to fix the bug would be to carefully review and update the logic for handling these cases to ensure that the appropriate indexer array is returned for each case.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        raise InvalidIndexError("cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique")

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            return indexer
    else:
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case when the target is an `IntervalIndex` by first checking if the indexes are equal. If they are, we return an array representing a 1:1 positional match. If they are not equal, we return an array of -1s. This logic ensures that the correct indexer array is returned for different scenarios.
