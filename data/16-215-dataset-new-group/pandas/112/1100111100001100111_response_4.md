To fix the bug, we need to address the TypeError issue that occurs when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The bug arises from the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. The `get_indexer` function is used to return an indexer for the input target based on the IntervalIndex. There are multiple conditions and branches within the function where the bug could potentially arise.

The bug appears to stem from the comparison between the target_as_index and the original IntervalIndex, as well as the dtype check for object_dtype, which might be leading to incorrect indexing.

In order to fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `get_indexer` function to correctly handle the comparison between the target_as_index and the original IntervalIndex, as well as ensuring that the dtype check for object_dtype is appropriately handled.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        # Handle the case where target_as_index is not an IntervalIndex
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By updating the logic to appropriately handle the comparison and dtype checks, we aim to resolve the TypeError issue described in the GitHub issue.
