The buggy function `get_indexer` is raising a `TypeError` with the message "No matching signature found" when trying to call the method `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. The error message suggests that the function `_engine.get_indexer` does not have a matching signature for the arguments being passed to it.

Upon analyzing the code of the buggy function, it can be seen that there is indeed a call to the method `_engine.get_indexer` with the argument `target_as_index.values`. Based on the error message, it seems that `_engine.get_indexer` doesn't have a suitable signature to accept the `values` attribute from `target_as_index`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the call to `_engine.get_indexer` is performed with the correct arguments that match the expected signature of the method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
  
    # existing code...

        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        else:
            # existing code...

# existing code...
```

In the corrected version, the call to `_engine.get_indexer` has been simplified to pass `target_as_index` directly, which resolves the issue with the signature mismatch.
