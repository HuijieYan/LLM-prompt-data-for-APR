The bug in the `get_indexer` function is causing a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The bug occurs when the `target_as_index` is a categorical index combined with an interval index.

The potential locations for the bug could be related to the conversion of the `target_as_index` or the usage of the `IntervalTree` in the `_engine`. Both of these may not be handling the conversion or operation properly when dealing with a categorical index combined with an interval index.

The bug is likely caused by the handling of a categorical index combined with an interval index when using the `get_indexer` function. This leads to a mismatch of signatures and results in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to revise the handling of the `target_as_index` when it is a categorical index combined with an interval index. Additionally, the usage of the `IntervalTree` in the `_engine` needs to be revised to handle this specific scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.to_numpy(), pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.to_numpy()

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `target_as_index` is a `pd.CategoricalIndex` and its underlying type is a `pd.IntervalIndex`. If so, we convert it to a numpy array. After making this adjustment, the function should handle the combination of a categorical index and an interval index properly, resolving the `TypeError` issue.

This correction should allow the `round` method to work properly when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
