The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. Based on the declaration, this method is used to return the indexer for the target array-like object.

The potential error locations in the code could be the conditional statements and the variable assignments and calculations. Also, there is a call to a private method `_check_method` within the method, which may have side effects that need to be investigated.

The cause of the bug can be analyzed as follows:
- The conditional statements might not be evaluating as expected.
- The comparison and assignments of the indexer could be incorrect.
- The implementation to handle overlapping indices may have issues.
- The call to the private method `_check_method` may introduce side effects.

To fix the bug:
- Verify the conditional statements to ensure they are comparing the correct conditions.
- Double-check the indexer assignments and calculations to ensure they are being carried out correctly.
- Address the specific logic for handling overlapping indices and the call to the private method to avoid any side effects.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values())
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the method argument is handled as per the documentation. The call to `is_overlapping` now has parentheses to invoke the method. The calls to class methods such as `left`, `right`, and `get_indexer` also have added parentheses to properly invoke those methods. Additionally, the conditional logic and indexing have been reviewed and corrected if necessary.
