Based on the code provided, the bug appears to be related to the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class. The bug seems to be causing incorrect indexing of the `IntervalIndex`, leading to a failure in the test_round_interval_category_columns test.

The potential errors in the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of overlapping indices.
2. Incorrect matching of left and right intervals.
3. Incorrect handling of different types of indexes.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic for handling overlapping indices and different types of indexes, leading to incorrect interval matching and indexing.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for handling overlapping indices and different types of indexes, ensuring that the intervals are matched correctly and the indexing is performed accurately.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        result = np.zeros(len(target_as_index), dtype=int)
        for i, (left, right) in enumerate(zip(target_as_index.left, target_as_index.right)):
            idx = self.get_loc([left, right]).values
            if len(idx) == 1 and not isinstance(idx[0], np.int64):
                # If idx is scalar, the result is an array of size 1. Get the value of the scalar.
                idx = idx[0]
            result[i] = -1 if len(idx) == 0 else idx
        return result
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we handle `IntervalIndex` and `target_as_index` separately and use the `get_loc` function to correctly match the intervals and retrieve the index. We also ensure the correct handling of overlapping indices and different types of indexes.

After this correction, the test_round_interval_category_columns test should pass successfully.
