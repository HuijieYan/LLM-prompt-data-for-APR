The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly handling the case when `self.is_overlapping` is `False`. This is causing the function to raise an `InvalidIndexError` when it should not be doing so. 

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the `if` condition for checking `self.is_overlapping` to ensure that the correct logic is applied when `self.is_overlapping` is `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if not self.is_overlapping():  # Modified the condition to call the method
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the code remains the same
            # ...
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the case when `self.is_overlapping` is `False` without raising an `InvalidIndexError`.
