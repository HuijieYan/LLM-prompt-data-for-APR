To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class, we need to identify potential issues and revise the code accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found. This could be due to an incorrect method signature or usage.
2. The failing test demonstrates that the `round` method fails when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
3. The bug description from the GitHub issue explains that the `round` method does not work as expected whenever the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. It is expected to behave as normal.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by an incorrect implementation of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class, which results in a `TypeError` with no matching signature found. This prevents the `round` method from functioning properly when using a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly. This involves ensuring that the method signature and the logic within the method are correct for this specific scenario.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Assume that the necessary imports are included
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):

    # ... (other methods)

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        # Handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            indexer = target_as_index.codes
        else:
            if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
                # ... (previous logic for IntervalIndex)
            # ... (other logic)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method, we specifically handle the case where the target is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` by extracting the codes from the `CategoricalIndex`. This ensures that the `round` method and other operations work as expected with this specific scenario.
