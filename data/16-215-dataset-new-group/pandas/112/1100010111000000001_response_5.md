The potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function `get_indexer` seems to have issues when dealing with the `IntervalIndex` data type, especially when checking for equality and finding common subtypes.
2. There may be an issue with how the function handles different types of indexes and the logic for creating the `indexer`.

The cause of the bug using the buggy function and the failing test:
The failing test calls the `round` function on a DataFrame with an index of type `CategoricalIndex` created using `pd.interval_range`. This action leads to a call to the `get_indexer` function. However, due to the issues in the `get_indexer` function, it fails to correctly round the data in the DataFrame, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual result.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` in the `get_indexer` function and ensure that equality comparisons and finding common subtypes are handled correctly.
2. Verify the logic for handling different types of indexes and make sure that the creation of the `indexer` is done accurately.
3. Test the modified function against the failing test to ensure that it now produces the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
Please note that the above correction assumes that the `IntervalIndex` is not equal to the `target_as_index`. It generates an indexer to return no matches in this case. The exact logic for handling the `IntervalIndex` and different types of indexes may vary based on the specific requirements. It's important to thoroughly test the function with various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected.
