The buggy code seems to be a part of the `IntervalIndex` class in the pandas library, specifically the `get_indexer` method. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the `round` method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

After analyzing the buggy function, the potential error locations are as follows:
1. The use of `self.is_overlapping`, which should be a function call instead of a property check.
2. Handling the case when the target index is an IntervalIndex and performing the comparison between left and right indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method does not handle the case properly when the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This leads to the `round` method failing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.is_overlapping` is called as a function and handle the case when the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex to allow proper rounding.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # Handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            return target_as_index.get_indexer(self, method=method)

    indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If it is, we call the `get_indexer` method on the target index instance to handle the rounding appropriately. If not, we delegate the indexing to the parent class and return its result.

This correction should address the issue of the `round` method failing when columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
