The bug in the given function is likely related to the conditional statements and the handling of different types of input indexes. The function's purpose is to return an indexer that represents the positions of elements in the input target array within the IntervalIndex. 

Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the function may not be handling the input indexes correctly, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, I suggest checking the conditional statements and the logic for handling different types of input indexes. It seems that the handling of `target_as_index` and the comparison with `self` could be causing the issue. Additionally, the use of `IntervalTree` and the logic for non-overlapping indexes should be reviewed.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, I simplified the logic for handling different types of input indexes and removed complex comparisons. Instead, I focused on generating the indexer based on the target index's values using the `_engine` attribute directly.

Please note that the given code snippet may be part of a larger codebase, so additional considerations may be needed.
