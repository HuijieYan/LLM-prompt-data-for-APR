## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class is encountering a TypeError when attempting to get the indexer using the target index values. The test case provided in the GitHub issue also confirms this bug, as the `round` method fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug seems to be related to the datatype compatibility and method signature matching, causing a TypeError to be raised when attempting to round a DataFrame with columns of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

## Bug cause
The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. When the target is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the method is encountering a TypeError, as it is unable to match the method signature properly.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class should be modified to handle the case where the target is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This may involve checking the datatype compatibility and handling the method signature matching appropriately to avoid the TypeError.

## The corrected version
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remain unchanged for IntervalIndex target
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method, limit, tolerance)
    else:
        # Handle the case of CategoricalIndex made from IntervalIndex
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version, the `get_indexer` method handles the case of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly by using the `_engine.get_indexer` method with the appropriate parameters. This should fix the TypeError encountered and allow the `round` method to work correctly on DataFrames with such columns.
