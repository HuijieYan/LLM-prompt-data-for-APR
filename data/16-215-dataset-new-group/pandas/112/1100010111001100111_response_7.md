The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely caused by the code not handling the case where the input parameter `target` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This is likely the cause of the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` as it involves rounding a DataFrame with IntervalIndex columns and using the `get_indexer` function internally.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle the case where the input `target` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to handle this specific case and perform the necessary operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same, unchanged from the original function

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

In the corrected function, we added a conditional check to handle the case where the input `target` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. If so, we extract the categories as an IntervalIndex and continue with the rest of the code as before. This should address the bug and make the function work correctly for the failing test case.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread as well. The `round` method should now work as expected for DataFrame with IntervalIndex columns, even when using a CategoricalIndex.
