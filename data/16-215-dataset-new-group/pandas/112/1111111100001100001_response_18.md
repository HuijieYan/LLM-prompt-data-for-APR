The bug appears to be in the logic that handles the case when the target is an IntervalIndex. 

The function first checks if the self IntervalIndex is overlapping. If it is not, the function proceeds to handle the target IntervalIndex. The logic checks if the indexes are equal and returns the positional match, then proceeds to handle different closed or incompatible subtypes, and finally handles non-overlapping cases.

The bug may be related to mishandling of the condition where the indexes are not equal. It appears that the logic to handle different closed or incompatible subtypes and non-overlapping cases may not be implemented correctly, potentially leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different closed or incompatible subtypes and non-overlapping cases needs to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure that the correct indexer is returned based on the given conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or self.dtype != target_as_index.dtype:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

    else:
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the implementation for handling different closed or incompatible subtypes and non-overlapping cases has been reviewed and updated to ensure that the correct indexer is returned based on the given conditions.
