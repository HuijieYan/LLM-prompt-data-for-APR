The buggy function `get_indexer` in the class `IntervalIndex` is failing to handle the case where `self.is_overlapping` is False. 

The buggy function has a conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping`, but it does not correctly check the boolean value of `self.is_overlapping`. Instead, it always executes the block of code that raises an error if `self.is_overlapping` is True, regardless of its actual value.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional statement to properly check the boolean value of `self.is_overlapping` and execute the appropriate logic based on its value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if not self.is_overlapping:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # the rest of the code remains the same as in the original buggy function
            # ...
```

With this implementation, the function will properly handle the case when `self.is_overlapping` is False.
