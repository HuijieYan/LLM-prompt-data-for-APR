## Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the usage of the `round` method when the columns are of `CategoricalIndex` type made from an `IntervalIndex`. The issue's description indicates that the `round` method fails in this scenario, throwing a `TypeError: No matching signature found`.

Looking at the buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class, the bug could potentially arise from the handling of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` in the conditional branches where the type of the index is checked.

The bug could be caused due to the `common_subtype` calculation or the conditional branching related to `CategoricalIndex`. The GitHub issue provides a specific scenario where this bug occurs - when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns of `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` in the `get_indexer` function. It fails to appropriately handle this scenario, leading to the `TypeError: No matching signature found` error when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns of such index types.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function appropriately handles the scenario of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This might involve modifying the conditional branches related to the type checking or the calculation of `common_subtype`.

@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        # Handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(
            target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex
        ):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
```
In the corrected version, we modified the conditional branch to handle the case where the `target_as_index` is of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. If this condition is met, we extract the categories and continue the rest of the code as before. This modification ensures that the `get_indexer` function can appropriately handle the scenario mentioned in the GitHub issue.
