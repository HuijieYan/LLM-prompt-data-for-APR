The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely causing the `round` method to fail when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This is due to a `TypeError: No matching signature found` being raised. The issue has been reported on GitHub and the expected output is for the `round` method to work as normal.

The bug is most likely occurring due to an issue with the signature or types of the input parameters being passed to the `get_indexer` function.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input parameters being passed to the `get_indexer` function are of the correct type and signature as expected by the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return indexer
```

In the corrected version, the function checks the type of `target_as_index`, and applicable operations are performed based on type. Additionally, the `ensure_platform_int` method has been removed from the return statement, keeping the output of the function consistent with the expected type. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `round` method works correctly with `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
