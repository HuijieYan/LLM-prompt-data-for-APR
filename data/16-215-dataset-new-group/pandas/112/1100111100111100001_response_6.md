The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the incorrect signature of the `get_indexer` method. This is indicated by the error message `TypeError: No matching signature found`.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the signature of the `get_indexer` method so that it matches the expected input types. Based on the provided information, it seems that the method is expecting a scalar array `target` as input.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function, with the signature of the `get_indexer` method adjusted to accept a scalar array as input:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,  # Change the type to accept any array-like input
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By changing the type of the `target` input parameter to accept any array-like input, the function should be able to handle the input correctly and avoid the TypeError reported in the failing test.
