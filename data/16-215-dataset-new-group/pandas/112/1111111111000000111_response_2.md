The potential error location within the buggy function is the `if self.is_overlapping` condition, which should be `if self.is_overlapping()`.

The bug is caused because the `is_overlapping` is a method, not an attribute, and should be called with parentheses to execute the method. This causes the condition to always be True, leading to an error being raised instead of handling the overlapping indices.

To fix the bug, the `if self.is_overlapping` condition should be replaced with `if self.is_overlapping()`. This will properly call the method and evaluate the condition as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Corrected condition
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The correction involves adding parentheses after `self.is_overlapping` to properly call the method. With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
