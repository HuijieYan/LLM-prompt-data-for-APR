The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class within the `pandas.core.indexes.interval` file seems to have an issue when trying to reindex using a categorical index constructed from an interval range. This is resulting in a `TypeError: No matching signature found`.

The potential error location within the buggy function could be the use of the `get_indexer` method and the subsequent call to `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the `get_indexer` method not receiving the appropriate arguments or handling the categorical index constructed from an interval range correctly. This results in a TypeError due to no matching signature found.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve modifying the behavior of the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the categorical index constructed from an interval range, ensuring that the appropriate arguments are passed and that the method is able to handle the specific type of index being used.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    return indexer
```

In the corrected version, we have added brackets `()` to the calls of related functions such as `self.is_overlapping()`, `self.left().get_indexer(...)`, and `self.right().get_indexer(...)` so that they are properly executed. We have also added a call to the `get_indexer` method of the superclass `Index`. This ensures that the method can handle the specific type of index being used.

This corrected version should be able to handle the categorical index constructed from an interval range without causing a `TypeError: No matching signature found` error.
