To fix the bug, it's important to focus on the `get_indexer` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The error message `TypeError: No matching signature found` indicates a problem with method signature matching. The input parameter types are not compatible with the method signature.

After reviewing the failing test, it seems that the issue arises when attempting to round a DataFrame with columns that are a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. This leads to a `TypeError` during the call to the `round` method.

The bug is likely occurring in the section where the `get_indexer` method is used for the target index. It fails to handle the CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex properly, causing the `TypeError` during the call to `round`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method handles the conversion from CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex to the appropriate data type, and its method signature matches the input types.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex, by extracting the underlying IntervalIndex from the CategoricalIndex. This ensures that the `get_indexer` method can handle it properly and resolves the `TypeError` issue.

By making this modification, the corrected `get_indexer` method should now properly handle the specified case and allow the DataFrame `round` method to work as expected with columns that are a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
