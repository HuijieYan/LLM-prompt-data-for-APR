The `get_indexer` function has the potential error locations in the following areas:
1. The `self._check_method(method)` call seems to be checking for the method argument, but it's not clear how this method is being checked or handled.
2. There are multiple conditional blocks and error handling sections in the function, which may lead to confusion and potential bugs.
3. The function has conditional blocks for different types of target indexes and may not handle all cases correctly.

The `get_indexer` function could be buggy due to the complex conditional logic and multiple error handling sections that may not cover all cases, leading to potential issues with handling different types of indexes.

One strategy to fix the bug is to refactor the function to handle different types of target indexes more uniformly and simplify the conditional logic.

The corrected version of the `get_indexer` function is provided below:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        indexer = self._get_indexer_for_scalar_index(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional logic for handling different types of target indexes has been simplified, and a separate function `_get_indexer_for_scalar_index` has been introduced to handle the case of heterogeneous scalar index. This approach aims to improve readability and maintainability while ensuring that all cases are handled appropriately.
