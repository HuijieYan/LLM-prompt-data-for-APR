The buggy function appears to be `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class located in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. 

From the failing test, we can observe that the error message is related to a `TypeError` with no matching signature found, specifically pointing to line 154 of `intervaltree.pxi`. This suggests that there is a mismatch in the signature of the function `get_indexer` with the parameter `scalar_t[:] target`.

Additionally, in the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, we notice that the values seem consistent and appropriate for the function being executed.

Based on the error message and the observed input and output values, it seems that there is a mismatch in the data type or signature when invoking the internal method `get_indexer` or `self._engine.get_indexer`.

To fix the bug, it's recommended to review the signature and data types being used when calling the internal method `get_indexer` or `self._engine.get_indexer`. This may involve verifying the expected signature of the method and comparing it with the actual parameters being passed during the function execution.

The updated `get_indexer` function could be as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            # Handle the case for different indexes
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    
    return indexer
```

By making the suggested changes, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
