The bug in the given `get_indexer` function is causing a TypeError when calling the `df.round()` method in the test function `test_round_interval_category_columns`. The failing test is trying to create a DataFrame with categorical columns using data that includes interval values.

The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be in the signature of the function and how `@Substitution` decorator is being used. This might be causing an issue related to typing and method arguments, and hence resulting in the failed test with the observed TypeError.

To fix the bug, the signature of the `get_indexer` function and the way method arguments are being used should be reviewed and corrected. It might also be necessary to ensure that the correct types are being used for the parameters and return value of this function.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> Union[np.ndarray, Any]:
```
Ensure that the correct types are being used for the parameters and the return value in this function. This should address the TypeError issue observed in the failing test.
