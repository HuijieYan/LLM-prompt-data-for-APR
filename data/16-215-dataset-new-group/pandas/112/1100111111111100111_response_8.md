The buggy function `get_indexer` is not handling the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This results in a `TypeError` due to no matching signature being found, as described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` constructed from an `IntervalIndex`. This results in an error during the rounding operation when calling the `get_indexer` function.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `get_indexer` function to properly handle the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` constructed from an `IntervalIndex`. 

Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# Import statements (already provided above)
# ...

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the function's code remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version of the function, it first checks if the `target` parameter is a `CategoricalIndex` with `IntervalIndex` categories. If it is, then it assigns the `target_as_index` variable to the categories of the `target` index. Otherwise, it proceeds with the rest of the function as before.

By handling the `CategoricalIndex` with `IntervalIndex` categories properly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
