The bug stems from an error in the method signature for the `get_indexer` function. The `get_indexer` function has a non-standard form of method definition, possibly due to the use of decorators and substitutions. The error message `TypeError: No matching signature found` suggests that there are signature mismatches in the definition of the `get_indexer` function, leaving pandas unable to resolve the correct method signature to match the input. This error is likely triggered when the `get_indexer` method is called in the context of the DataFrame operation, causing the test failure.

To fix the bug, the method should be redefined in a standard form, without the use of decorators and substitutions that might be interfering with method resolution. I would suggest defining the `get_indexer` method with standard argument signature and removing any customized type annotations that might be causing pandas to not recognize the method properly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
    def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By restoring the method to a standard form with recognizable argument signatures, pandas would be able to identify and use the correct implementation of the `get_indexer` method. This should fix the bug and ensure the method is called successfully during DataFrame operations, passing the failing test.
