Issues with the function:
1. The `get_indexer` function is taking an incorrect signature.
2. TypeError is raised during test execution, indicating that the function was called with an incorrect signature.

The cause of the bug:
The implemented `get_indexer` function takes an incorrect signature, which leads to a TypeError when called with incorrect arguments.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `get_indexer` function to take the correct signature to resolve the TypeError raised during test execution.

Updated `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> Union[np.ndarray, Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[str]]]:  # Updated signature
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

Updated `get_indexer` function is provided to resolve the TypeError issue with the function signature.

The corrected version of the `get_indexer` function takes the correct signature to resolve the TypeError raised during test execution.
