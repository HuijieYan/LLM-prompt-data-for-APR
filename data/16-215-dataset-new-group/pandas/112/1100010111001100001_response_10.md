## Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be occurring when the function is trying to handle overlapping indices. In the provided test case, the `target_as_index` is the same as the `self` interval index, causing the code to enter the block where it tries to handle overlapping indices. This leads to the erroneous behavior and the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `target_as_index` is the same as the `self` interval index in a different way, rather than treating it as overlapping indices. We can compare the two indexes directly and return the positional match if they are equal.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.equals(target_as_index):
        return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding a direct comparison with `self.equals(target_as_index)` and returning the positional match if they are equal, we handle the case of the target and self being the same index and avoid the erroneous behavior encountered with overlapping indices.
