The buggy function in the given source code is the `get_indexer` function which is intended to return an indexer array for the provided target based on the IntervalIndex values. However, the bug seems to be in the logic used within the function, specifically in the conditional statements and the handling of different cases. The function seems to be comparing and indexing based on the interval values and dtype, but there are issues with handling overlapping indices and scalar indexing.

The potential causes of the bug could be:
1. Incorrect handling of the `is_overlapping` condition.
2. Issues with comparing two distinct Interval Indices.
3. Incorrect handling of different data types (e.g., object dtype) for the target.
4. Problems while trying to obtain the indexer with the `_engine` function.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Correctly handle the `is_overlapping` condition and raise an error if there are overlapping intervals.
2. Check for the special cases such as matching equal indexes and handling different data types.
3. Ensure proper indexing and handling of distinct Interval Indices and scalar indexing cases.

The corrected version of the `get_indexer` function is as follows:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle equal indexes
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # Handle different closed or incompatible subtype
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # Handle non-overlapping indices
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_list_like(target_as_index):
        # Handle scalar indexing
        target_as_index = [target_as_index]
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)
    else:
        # Handle cases apart from equal indexes and scalar indexing
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `_check_method` function is used to verify the method argument, and proper handling of overlapping and non-overlapping indices is implemented. Additionally, distinct Interval Indices and scalar indexing cases are handled separately. Lastly, the proper dtype and subtype handling has been included for better comparison and indexing.

The above-mentioned corrections should fix the bug in the function.
