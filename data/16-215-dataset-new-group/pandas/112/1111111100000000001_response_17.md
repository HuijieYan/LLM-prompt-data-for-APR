## Analysis
This is a complex piece of code that deals with interval indexing. The code seems to be checking for overlapping intervals, handling different types of indexes, and finding the position of elements based on the interval type.

## Identified potential errors
1. `if self.is_overlapping:`
   It looks like `self.is_overlapping` should be a method call, not a property access. It needs parentheses to actually call the method. 
   It should be `if self.is_overlapping():`

2. `for key in target_as_index:`
   The loop iterates over `target_as_index`, assuming it is an iterable. However, if it's a scalar, this operation would raise an error.

   
## Bug cause
The potential errors identified above can cause the buggy function to not function as expected. Specifically, the method call `self.is_overlapping()` is crucial for the conditional logic to work properly. Similarly, the assumption that `target_as_index` is iterable could lead to erroneous behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Correctly call the `self.is_overlapping()` method.
2. Add a check for `target_as_index` to determine if it's an iterable or a scalar, and handle both cases appropriately.

## Corrected version
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # Correctly calling the method self.is_overlapping()
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Add a check for scalar target_as_index
    if is_scalar(target_as_index):
        try:
            loc = self.get_loc(target_as_index)
            return np.array([loc], dtype="intp")
        except KeyError:
            return np.array([-1], dtype="intp")

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
```
I've added a check for scalar `target_as_index` and handled it separately if it's a scalar. If it's an iterable, the code proceeds as before. This should address the potential issues and fix the bug.
