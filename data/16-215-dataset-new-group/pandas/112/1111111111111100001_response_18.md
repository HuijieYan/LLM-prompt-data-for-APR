The bug in the `get_indexer` function is causing a `TypeError` to be raised. The bug occurs when checking whether the `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex` and then attempting to perform operations on it. The issue arises because the code fails to check for overlapping indices correctly and does not handle non-overlapping cases as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues:

1. The check for overlapping indices is incorrect. It should use the `is_overlapping` function to determine if the indices are overlapping.

2. The code does not handle non-overlapping cases correctly, leading to the `TypeError` being raised.

3. The code does not handle the case when `target_as_index` is a homogeneous scalar index, leading to incorrect behavior and potentially raising a `TypeError`.

Here's the fixed version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        
        if target_as_index.na_value is not None:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the fix, we have made the following changes:

1. Added a call to `is_overlapping()` instead of accessing `self.is_overlapping` directly to correctly determine if the indices are overlapping.

2. Added a check for the `na_value` attribute in the case where `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex` to handle non-overlapping cases and avoid `TypeError`.

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should now pass successfully.
