In this buggy function `get_indexer` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`, the cause of the bug is possibly due to the incorrect implementation of the `get_indexer` method. The error message `TypeError: No matching signature found` indicates that there is no matching signature for the `get_indexer` function. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` interacts with the `round` method in the DataFrame class, which internally tries to call the `get_indexer` method. This indirectly triggers the failing test error message. 

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `get_indexer` function has a valid signature and correctly handles the input arguments.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = ensure_index(target)

    return indexer
```

In this corrected version, I have removed the unnecessary conditional and instead directly called `self._engine.get_indexer` to handle the `IntervalIndex` case. In the `else` branch, rather than taking individual elements, I have implemented it such that it is returning the `target` index itself indirectly through `indexer = ensure_index(target)`. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
