The error message "TypeError: No matching signature found" is due to an issue with the `get_indexer` method. The error occurs specifically when trying to pass a target index value to the `get_indexer` method, leading to a type error.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method does not have the correct signature to accept a scalar target index. Therefore, when trying to pass a target index to the method, it does not match the expected signature, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to accept a scalar target index correctly and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method that addresses the issue:

```python
from typing import List

def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
    elif not is_list_like(target_as_index):
        # single scalar index value
        indexer = self.get_loc(target_as_index)
    else:
        # rest of the code remains the same
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `get_indexer` method now correctly handles the case when the target index is a single scalar value, ensuring that the method signature matches the input type.

With this correction, the method should now accept the scalar target index value without raising a TypeError, passing the failing test.
