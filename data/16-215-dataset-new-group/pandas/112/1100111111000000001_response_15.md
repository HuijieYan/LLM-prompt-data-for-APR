The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class seems to have multiple issues. Here's a breakdown of the potential errors:

1. The method `self.is_overlapping` should be called as `self.is_overlapping()` to actually execute the method and check its returned value for a condition.
2. There are multiple conditions and return paths in the function, so they need to be carefully evaluated and tested individually to identify the specific points of failure.
3. The `is_object_dtype` condition might not work as expected and should be double-checked.
4. There are potential issues with the logic and flow of the code that might lead to incorrect indexing and mismatched results.

To fix the bug, it's important to carefully review and test each condition and execution path to ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios, including when dealing with homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed the method call
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_dtype_equal(common_subtype, np.dtype('O')):  # Check for object dtype
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_dtype_equal(target_as_index, np.dtype('O')):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index), np.dtype('int64'))  # Downcast to int64
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version ensures that the method calls are properly executed, conditions are correctly evaluated, and the correct data types are used for comparisons and operations.
