The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` is causing it to fail for the given test. The bug lies in the `get_indexer` function's logic that deals with handling overlaps and different types of intervals.

The buggy function `get_indexer` is intended to return an indexer array for the given target values. It checks for overlapping indices and identifies the positional matches in the target. However, it is encountering an issue where the logic for handling overlapping or different types of indices is incorrect. This leads to the function raising an `InvalidIndexError` when handling overlapping indices.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling overlapping indices and different types of intervals needs to be re-evaluated. The function should correctly identify the overlapping intervals and handle them appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, Substitution
from pandas.core.indexes.base import InvalidIndexError, ensure_index
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import find_common_type
import numpy as np

@Substitution(
    **{
        "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
            """
            Raises
            ------
            NotImplementedError
                If any method argument other than the default of
                None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
            """
        )
    },
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    if method is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "Any method argument other than the default of None is not yet implemented."
        )

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.IntervalIndex):
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index)
    else:
        # Assume non-overlapping here, add checks for overlap
        indexer = np.flatnonzero(self.isin(target_as_index))
        return indexer
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks for the method argument and raises a `NotImplementedError` if it is not None. Then, it ensures that the target is converted to an index using the `ensure_index` function.

After that, the function checks if the target is an `IntervalIndex`. If it is, the function calls `get_indexer_non_unique` with the target index and returns the result. If the target is not an `IntervalIndex`, it assumes non-overlapping and returns the indexer by using the `isin` function.

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
