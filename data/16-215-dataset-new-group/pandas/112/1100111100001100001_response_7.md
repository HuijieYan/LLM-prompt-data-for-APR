The buggy function is `get_indexer` defined within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The function takes several input parameters including `self` (an instance of `IntervalIndex`), `target` (an array-like value), `method`, `limit`, and `tolerance`.

From the runtime values and types provided in Case 1, it's clear that the function is intended to work with `IntervalIndex` instances and perform comparisons and indexing operations based on the interval properties and values.

The bug in the function seems to be related to the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` instances, as well as the comparison and indexing operations based on the properties of the intervals.

The strategy for fixing the bug in the function `get_indexer` would involve reviewing the logic for comparing and indexing `IntervalIndex` instances, ensuring that the comparisons are made based on interval properties such as closure and values, and handling the different cases appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if (
            self.closed != target_as_index.closed
            or is_object_dtype(common_subtype)
        ):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = np.array(
            [
                self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1
                for key in target_as_index
            ]
        )

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the function `get_indexer` has been updated to handle the different cases for comparing `IntervalIndex` instances, ensuring that the comparisons are made based on interval properties and values. Specific fixes have been applied to handle overlapping indices and to ensure proper indexing based on the properties of the intervals.

By applying these corrections, the function should now behave as intended and address the buggy behavior.
