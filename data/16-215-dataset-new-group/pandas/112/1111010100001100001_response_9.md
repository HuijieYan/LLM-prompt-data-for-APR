The bug in the `get_indexer` function appears to be related to the handling of the case where `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`. 

From the provided runtime values, it seems that the function is correctly identifying that `self.equals(target_as_index)` is true, yet the implementation is not returning the expected result of `np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")`, which would be a 1:1 positional match.

To fix the bug, the logic for returning the positional match when `self.equals(target_as_index)` should be revisited and potentially modified to ensure that the correct result is returned.

Additionally, it might also be beneficial to further investigate the other potential branches where the function returns results and verify that they are correctly implemented and returning the expected results.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            else:
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the `if self.equals(target_as_index):` condition is directly handled, ensuring that the correct result is returned for the specific case where `self.equals(target_as_index)` is true. Additionally, the potentially problematic logic for other branches has also been revisited to ensure correctness.
