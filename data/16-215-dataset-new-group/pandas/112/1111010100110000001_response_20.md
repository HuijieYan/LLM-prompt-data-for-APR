The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` is causing a `TypeError: No matching signature found`. This error occurs when the method is called with an argument that doesn't match its expected signature.

The cause of the bug is in the `get_indexer` function where an error occurs when we attempt to get an indexer for a scalar target. The bug is likely located in the part of the function that is supposed to handle a homogeneous scalar index using the `IntervalTree`.

To fix the bug, we need to specifically handle the case where `target_as_index` is a scalar to ensure that it is properly converted and used as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code unchanged
        elif is_scalar(target_as_index):
            # Handle the case where target_as_index is a scalar
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(np.array([target_as_index]))
        else:
            # remaining code unchanged
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this fix, the `get_indexer` function should now work correctly for scalar targets and pass the failing test.
