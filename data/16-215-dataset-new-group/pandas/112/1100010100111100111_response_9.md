The bug in the `get_indexer` function is causing a TypeError to be raised when attempting to round a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The bug appears to be related to the type checking of the input `target` parameter.

The error message indicates that there is no matching signature found for the `get_indexer` function, which suggests that the type or signature of the input `target` parameter does not match what the function is expecting.

In the failing test case, the input parameters `self` and `target` are both instances of `IntervalIndex`, which seems to be causing the bug.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to update the type hint for the `target` parameter in the `get_indexer` function to be compatible with the input values being passed.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: Union[Index, AnyArrayLike],
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By updating the type hint for the `target` parameter to accept a `Union` of `Index` and `AnyArrayLike`, the function should now be able to handle various types of input, including the `IntervalIndex` instances causing the bug.

With this change, the `get_indexer` function should no longer raise a TypeError when used in combination with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and the failing test should pass.
