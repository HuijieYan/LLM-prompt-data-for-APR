In the buggy function `get_indexer` of the `IntervalIndex` class, the actual bug lies in the signature of the function get_indexer. It seems like there is a mismatch in the function signature.

The error message suggests that there is a TypeError with the signature. This indicates that the function `get_indexer` is not being called with the expected arguments, or there is a mismatch in the function signature being expected and the actual function signature.

The bug is likely caused by an incorrect function signature being used when calling the `get_indexer` function. There might be a mismatch between the expected signature and the actual data-type of the argument passed to the function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the signature of the `get_indexer` function matches the expected signature. This includes making sure that the argument types and return types match the expected types.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Union[int, float]]]:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer), None  # assuming it is a placeholder for potential return value that is a tuple
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the signature of the `get_indexer` function matches the expected signature. We've also made sure that the return type is a tuple that includes the indexer and an additional value of type `Optional[Union[int, float]]`. This should address the TypeError related to the function signature mismatch.
