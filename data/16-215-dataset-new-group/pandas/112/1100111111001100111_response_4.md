The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely causing the `TypeError: No matching signature found` issue when trying to round a DataFrame with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The bug arises due to a comparison error, as well as a potential type mismatch when creating a `target_as_index`.

The bug occurs when trying to round a DataFrame with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`. The problem lies in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class.

The issue arises because the comparison of the `target_as_index` is not handled correctly, and there is a potential type mismatch when creating the `target_as_index`.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex)` block needs to be modified to handle overlapping indices properly. Additionally, the `target_as_index` needs to be converted to an `IntervalIndex` if it is not already of that type before further operations.

A corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if not isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = IntervalIndex(target_as_index)
    
    if self.equals(target_as_index):
        return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

    common_subtype = find_common_type(
        [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
    )
    if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
        return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

    left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
    right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
    indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In this corrected version, we have added logic to handle the case where the `target_as_index` is not already an `IntervalIndex` and ensured that it is of that type before further operations. Additionally, we have corrected the comparison logic and fixed the call to the `is_overlapping` method.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the comparison and type conversion correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test.
