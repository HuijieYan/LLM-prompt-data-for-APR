The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when calling the `get_indexer` function. This suggests that there is an issue with how the arguments are being passed to this function.

### Bug Analysis
The input parameters `self` and `target` are of type `IntervalIndex`, and within the function, `target_as_index` is being created by calling `ensure_index(target)`. At the end of the function, `target_as_index.values` is being used as an argument to the `_engine.get_indexer` function.

The issue seems to be with the input type of the `_engine.get_indexer` function. It is expecting a scalar of type `target`, but it is receiving an `IntervalArray`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, the usage of `target_as_index.values` as an argument to `_engine.get_indexer` should be revised. Instead, the entire `target_as_index` should be passed as an argument to the `_engine.get_indexer` function, as it seems to be the appropriate type.

The corrected version of the function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code unchanged

        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)  # Pass entire target_as_index
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # remaining code unchanged
    else:
        # remaining code unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By passing the entire `target_as_index` to the `_engine.get_indexer` function, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass.
