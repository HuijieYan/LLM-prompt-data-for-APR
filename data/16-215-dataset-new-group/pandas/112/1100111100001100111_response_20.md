The bug in the `get_indexer` function appears to be related to handling IntervalIndexes and their associated methods. When the function is called with `self.is_overlapping` set to `False`, it should return a valid indexer based on the target input. However, the current implementation is not handling this case correctly, leading to a potential bug.

The bug seems to stem from the logic that handles different types of targets (IntervalIndex, scalar, etc.) and their corresponding indexers. The logic for handling IntervalIndexes in particular appears to be problematic, resulting in the function not producing the correct indexer for the target input.

To fix this bug, the implementation for handling IntervalIndexes as targets needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially revised. It might also be necessary to revisit the logic for handling self.is_overlapping and ensure that it's being used correctly in determining the indexer.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `self.is_overlapping` method is called with parentheses to execute it as a function and obtain its value. This change ensures that the correct condition is checked to determine if the index is overlapping.

By making these updates, the `get_indexer` function should handle IntervalIndexes and their associated methods more accurately, potentially resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to intervals in columns when using the round method.
