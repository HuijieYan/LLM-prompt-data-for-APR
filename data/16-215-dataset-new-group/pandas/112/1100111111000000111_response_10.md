Based on the provided code, the bug seems to be in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The issue is likely related to how the method handles non-overlapping intervals, specifically when the target is a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug seems to be related to rounding and handling non-overlapping indices. The failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` appears to be related to the GitHub issue titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex". The issue describes how the `round` method fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The proposed strategy for fixing the bug involves potential enhancements to handle the specific scenario of using `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex` during rounding. The bug should be addressed by modifying the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the case of `CategoricalIndex` derived from `IntervalIndex` and incorporate the expected behavior for rounding.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "Cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.equals(target_as_index):
        return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

    # Handle other cases for non-overlapping and different closed/compatible subtypes
    # ... (rest of the original logic)
```

The corrected version includes an additional condition to check if the target is a `CategoricalIndex` with `categories` of `IntervalIndex`, and then handling the relevant logic accordingly.

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should be able to handle the case when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex` more effectively, addressing the rounding issue described in the GitHub issue.
