The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the comparison and indexing of IntervalIndex objects. In the failing test case, the function is not returning the expected result when trying to round the values in a DataFrame based on the columns of an IntervalIndex object.

The bug seems to be occurring in the block of code where the function checks if the `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`, as it is not correctly handling the matching and indexing of the intervals.

Based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it seems that the function is not properly handling the comparison and indexing of the intervals within the `IntervalIndex` objects, leading to incorrect results in the failing test case.

To fix this bug, the comparison and indexing of the intervals in the `IntervalIndex` objects need to be revised to ensure that the correct intervals are matched and indexed when performing operations with `IntervalIndex` objects.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            result = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            for i, (left, right) in enumerate(zip(target_as_index.left, target_as_index.right)):
                for j, (self_left, self_right) in enumerate(zip(self.left, self.right)):
                    if left == self_left and right == self_right:
                        result[i] = j
                        break
            return result
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, we iterate through the intervals and compare each pair of intervals between `self` and `target_as_index`, and when a match is found, we store the index of `self` in the result array. This ensures that the correct intervals are matched and indexed, fixing the bug.
