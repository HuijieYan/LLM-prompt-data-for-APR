The buggy function `get_indexer` is supposed to return an array of index positions of the target values in the given `IntervalIndex`. However, the current implementation has some issues which are causing the tests to fail.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for overlapping indices may not be functioning correctly.
2. The logic for handling different types of target indices and finding matching positions is complex and may contain bugs.
3. Converting `target` to an index using `ensure_index` and then handling different cases based on the type of the index might not be handled properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of different types of target indices and the logic for finding matching positions in the `IntervalIndex`. The complexity of the logic may result in incorrect handling of the target indices and their respective positions in the `IntervalIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the logic for handling different types of target indices to simplify and improve the clarity of the code.
2. Ensure that the logic for determining matching positions in the `IntervalIndex` is correct and handles all edge cases appropriately.
3. Verify the logic for overlapping indices and ensure that it correctly identifies such cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version, the logic for handling different types of target indices is simplified, and a common approach is used to find the positions of the target values in the `IntervalIndex`. The is_overlapping method is correctly called as a function to check for overlapping indices.
