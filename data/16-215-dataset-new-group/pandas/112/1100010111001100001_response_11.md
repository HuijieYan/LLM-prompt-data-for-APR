The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to how the `target_as_index` variable is processed and used within the function. Based on the provided test case and runtime values, it appears that the function is not handling the `target_as_index` properly when it is an `IntervalIndex`.

In the failing test, the input `target` is an `IntervalIndex` with closed intervals, and it seems that the function is not correctly matching the intervals and generating the expected output.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic within the function that handles `IntervalIndex` and ensure that it properly compares and indexes the intervals as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.where(self._left_indexer == self._right_indexer, self._left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        indexer = np.asarray(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` has been simplified. It now directly checks for equality between the indexes and uses `np.where` to generate the indexer based on the comparison result.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
