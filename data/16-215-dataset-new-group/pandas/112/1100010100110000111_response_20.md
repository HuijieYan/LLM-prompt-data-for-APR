The bug in the `get_indexer` function is causing the "TypeError: No matching signature found" error in the failing test. This error occurs when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns of type `CategoricalIndex` that are made from an `IntervalIndex`. The function is failing to execute due to the absence of a matching signature, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is likely in the implementation of the `get_indexer` function, specifically where it tries to get the indexer by calling `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle the `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        return target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
    else:
        return ensure_index(target_as_index).get_indexer(self)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the cases where the `target` is either `IntervalIndex` or `CategoricalIndex` by calling the `get_indexer` method of the respective index.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `round` method works as expected when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
