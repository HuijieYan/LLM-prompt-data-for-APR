The bug in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class is likely causing the issue reported. The method is failing to handle the case where the input target is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The problematic part of the method seems to be the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` targets and the check for overlapping indices.

To resolve the bug:
- Add specific handling for `IntervalIndex` targets when they are used as `CategoricalIndex`, ensuring that the method can handle this scenario properly.
- Address the logic for checking overlapping indices, as it might not be behaving as expected for certain inputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target._index, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target._index
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # handle IntervalIndex targets
        # rest of the logic stays the same
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making these changes, the `get_indexer` method should be able to handle the problematic scenario reported in the GitHub issue.
