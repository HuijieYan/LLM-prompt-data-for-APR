The bug in the provided function is likely due to the incorrect comparison in the if statement `if self.is_overlapping`. The condition `self.is_overlapping` is evaluating as a truthy value (e.g., True or not None) rather than calling the method `self.is_overlapping()` to obtain the result.

To fix the bug, the if statement condition should be `if self.is_overlapping()` to correctly call the `is_overlapping` method.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Rest of the code remains unchanged

@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The correction involves changing the condition from `if self.is_overlapping` to `if self.is_overlapping()`. With this change, the code will correctly call the `is_overlapping` method and compare its result in the if statement, fixing the bug.
