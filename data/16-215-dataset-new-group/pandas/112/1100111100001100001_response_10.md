The bug in the provided function is that it tries to call the `is_overlapping` attribute as a method instead of a property. This causes an error because it is treated as a method call without parentheses.

To fix the bug, we need to change `self.is_overlapping` to `self.is_overlapping()` in the buggy function to correctly call it as a property.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function should correctly call the `is_overlapping` property and avoid the error.
