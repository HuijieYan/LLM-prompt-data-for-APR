## Correction
The bug seems to be occurring due to an issue with the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. It fails to handle the rounding operation for columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The buggy function is not handling the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` correctly. It should fall back to a different method to handle this type of index.

The corrected version of the buggy function should include a conditional check for the `CategoricalIndex` and handle it separately by falling back to a different method for indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            # Handle CategoricalIndex separately
            indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
        elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle IntervalIndex as before
            # ...
        else:
            # Handle other index types
            # ...
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now correctly handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`.

This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the round method works as expected for columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
