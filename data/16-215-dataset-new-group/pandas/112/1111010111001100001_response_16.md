The bug is likely occurring within the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is likely failing due to incorrect rounding behavior when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with a `CategoricalIndex` containing interval data.

The `get_indexer` function is responsible for obtaining the index of the target elements within the interval index. It handles different cases based on the type of the target index.

In the provided case, the input parameters and their types are given along with the relevant variables right before the function's return. 

It seems that the bug may be related to how the indexers are being calculated and returned, leading to incorrect indexing for the interval data. Additionally, the handling of interval data with the `IntervalTree` may also be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we should carefully review the logic used to calculate the indexers for interval data. It may be necessary to modify the logic for handling different types of target indexes and ensure correct indexing for interval data.

Below is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
        
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` targets has been simplified to return correct indexers. Additionally, when the target is not an `IntervalIndex`, the indexing mechanism has been modified to ensure correct indexing for interval data. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
