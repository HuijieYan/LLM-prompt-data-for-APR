Based on the error message, the failing test, and the buggy function, it seems that the bug is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with "No matching signature found" in the `interval_tree.pxi` file.

From the function `get_indexer`, the potential error locations could be:
1. The `ensure_index` method, where the `target` is being converted to an index. There could be an issue with the conversion.
2. The `_engine.get_indexer` method, where the error seems to be occurring according to the error message.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the conversion of the `target` to an index in the `ensure_index` method or the way the `target` is processed by the `_engine.get_indexer` method. The error message "No matching signature found" suggests there might be an issue with the signature of the method being used.

One strategy for fixing the bug could be to review the `ensure_index` method and the `_engine.get_indexer` method. Ensure that the target is being properly converted to an index and that the method being called has the correct signature.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function based on the identified potential error locations and strategy for fixing the bug:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/interval.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: Union[AnyArrayLike, float],
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> Union[np.ndarray, float]:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="int64")
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = np.array(self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values), dtype="int64")
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = [self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index]
    
        return ensure_platform_int(np.array(indexer, dtype="int64"))
```

The corrected version of the function includes changes to the input type hints to accept a float, updating the return type hints, and ensuring the correct data types for the returned index array. Additionally, the method being used to compute the indexer has been updated to correctly convert the result to a NumPy array with the correct data type.

With these changes, the corrected function should address the potential issues identified and pass the failing test.
