To fix the buggy function, let's follow these steps:

1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class:
   - The buggy function is `get_indexer` and it is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class.

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The potential error locations are:
     a. `get_indexer` method fails to handle overlapping indices.
     b. If the target index is an `IntervalIndex`, it may not handle cases where the indexes are not equal or compatible.
     c. The function doesn't seem to handle cases where the target is a homogeneous scalar index.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
   - The function seems to fail to handle different cases related to index matching and handling overlapping indices.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
   - To fix the bug, we need to improve the logic for handling overlapping indices and the different cases where the target index may be of different types.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = "Cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            elif self._is_compatible(target_as_index):
                return self._get_indexer_non_overlapping(target_as_index)
            else:
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            return self._get_indexer_scalar_index(target_as_index)
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now checks if the target index is an `IntervalIndex` and whether it is compatible with the current index. If compatible, it calls a new private method `_get_indexer_non_overlapping` to handle the index matching. Otherwise, it returns `-1` for the target index length.
- If the target index is not an `IntervalIndex`, it calls a new private method `_get_indexer_scalar_index` to handle the cases of homogeneous scalar index.

The implementation of the private methods `_is_compatible`, `_get_indexer_non_overlapping`, and `_get_indexer_scalar_index` will need to be defined within the class to complete the fix. These methods will handle the specific logic for each case and improve the overall functionality of the `get_indexer` method.
