The bug in the `get_indexer` function appears to be related to processing `IntervalIndex` objects, causing issues with the `round` method and resulting in a `TypeError`. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the comparison of `IntervalIndex` objects and their values, leading to the failure of the `round` method.

Upon further analysis, the issue seems to originate from the comparison and processing of the `target_as_index` values. The function attempts to compare `target_as_index` with `self` and handle them differently based on their types, leading to potential inconsistency in processing the indexes and resulting in the `TypeError` when calling the `round` method.

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the comparison and processing of `IntervalIndex` objects needs to be reviewed and corrected in the `get_indexer` function.

Additionally, the handling of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` should also be considered to ensure seamless functionality with the `round` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function that addresses the bug:

```python
# Corrected version of the get_indexer function
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(np.array(indexer))
```

In the corrected version, changes include:
1. Calling `self.is_overlapping()` as a method to retrieve the boolean value for overlapping indices.
2. Calling `self._engine()` as a method to retrieve the engine instance for IntervalTree.
3. Adjusting the return statement to ensure that the return value is converted to an array using `np.array(indexer)`.

These changes address the potential issues found in the original `get_indexer` function and aim to resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
