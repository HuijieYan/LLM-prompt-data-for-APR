The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the handling of `IntervalIndex` and `IntervalArray` objects. The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found`, which suggests that there is an issue with the type signature of the `get_indexer` method or the type of the input parameter.

The input parameters `self` and `target` are both instances of `IntervalIndex`, and the function seems to be designed to handle these types of inputs. However, the error message and the runtime values indicate an issue with the type signature of the method or the type of the input parameter.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve checking the type signature of the `get_indexer` method, ensuring that it matches the expected input types (e.g., `IntervalIndex`). Additionally, it may be necessary to review the implementation of the method to handle `IntervalIndex` and `IntervalArray` inputs properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: Union[IntervalIndex, IntervalArray],
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By updating the type signature of the `target` parameter to accept both `IntervalIndex` and `IntervalArray`, and ensuring that the implementation properly handles these types, the bug should be fixed.
