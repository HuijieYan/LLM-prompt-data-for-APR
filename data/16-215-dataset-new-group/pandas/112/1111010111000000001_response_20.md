The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class of the `pandas` library. The function is responsible for generating an indexer array that can be used to index into the interval index based on the target array.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of overlapping indices.
2. Incorrect handling of different closed or incompatible subtype.
3. Incorrect handling of homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle overlapping indices and different closed or incompatible subtypes correctly, leading to incorrect indexing of the interval index, which causes the failing test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle overlapping indices, different closed or incompatible subtypes, and different types of target arrays correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.equals(target_as_index):
        return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
    common_subtype = find_common_type(
        [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
    )
    
    if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
        return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

    left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
    right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
    indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version, we handle the case of overlapping indices by calling `get_indexer_non_unique` and we correctly compare the subtypes and closed attribute of the indexes.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
