The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely causing issues with the `test_round_interval_category_columns` test. The `get_indexer` function is supposed to return an indexer for the target array, but it seems to have some issues with handling interval indexes and scalar indexes.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of interval indexes and scalar indexes within the `get_indexer` function. The function is not correctly handling overlapping indices and is not appropriately dealing with different closed or incompatible subtypes. This results in incorrect indexers being returned, which causes the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for handling interval indexes and scalar indexes within the `get_indexer` function. It's important to ensure that overlapping indices are handled properly, and that different closed or incompatible subtypes are appropriately dealt with. Additionally, the function should correctly handle homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.is_overlapping:
            return self._get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index)
        else:
            return self._get_indexer_non_overlapping(target_as_index)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index], dtype='int64')

    return indexer
```

In the corrected version of the function, we've separated the logic for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices and refactored the handling of scalar indexes to ensure proper indexing. This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing test.
