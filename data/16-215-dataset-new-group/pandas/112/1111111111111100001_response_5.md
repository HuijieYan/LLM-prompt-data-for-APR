The bug in the provided function is that the method `is_overlapping` is incorrectly used as a property, causing the condition `if self.is_overlapping` to always evaluate to `True`. This leads to the error `TypeError: No matching signature found`.

To fix this bug, the condition should be changed to `if self.is_overlapping()`. This will correctly call the `is_overlapping` method and evaluate the condition based on its return value.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call is_overlapping as a method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
