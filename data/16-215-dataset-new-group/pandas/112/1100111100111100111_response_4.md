The bug in the provided code causes a TypeError with the message "No matching signature found" when using the round method on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The code fails to handle this specific scenario, which results in the TypeError. The failing test outlined in the GitHub issue further confirms this behavior.

To fix the bug, the get_indexer method in the IntervalIndex class needs to be modified. Specifically, it should correctly handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # Handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories.values, pd.IntervalArray):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target.categories.values)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the specific handling for a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the corrected code ensures that the get_indexer method can handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue and prevent the TypeError from occurring.

By making this modification, the code will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
