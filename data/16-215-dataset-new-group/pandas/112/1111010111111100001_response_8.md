The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the use of the `self._engine.get_indexer` method and the handling of the `target` input parameter. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the signature of the `get_indexer` function, and this is likely due to how the `target` parameter is being treated within the function.

The `target` parameter is being converted to an `IntervalIndex` using the `ensure_index` function, and then the `get_indexer` method of the `_engine` attribute is being called with `target_as_index.values`, where `target_as_index` is the converted `IntervalIndex`. This seems to be causing the issue with the function's signature.

To fix this bug, you can modify the way the `target` parameter is being handled. Instead of converting the `target` to an `IntervalIndex`, you can directly pass it to the `_engine.get_indexer` method without any conversions.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/interval.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # Previous code here...

    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        if isinstance(target, IntervalIndex):
            # Previous logic for handling IntervalIndex
        else:
            # Directly pass target to _engine.get_indexer without conversions
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By directly passing the `target` parameter to the `_engine.get_indexer` method without any conversions, the bug related to the function's signature should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
