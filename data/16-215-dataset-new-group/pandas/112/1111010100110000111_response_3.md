The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely due to an incorrect type signature in the `get_indexer` method call. The error message "TypeError: No matching signature found" suggests that there is a mismatch in the type signature during method lookup.

The `get_indexer` method is used to get the indices of elements in a target array or index in the current index. The error occurs when attempting to get the indices using the `get_indexer` method.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the type signature of the `get_indexer` method is correctly specified and that it matches the type of input being passed to the method. Additionally, it may be necessary to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is able to handle the input type when it is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            result = super().get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
            return result
        else:
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
``` 

In the corrected version, we make sure the `target_as_index` is converted to an `IntervalIndex`. Then we call the `get_indexer` recursively so that the correct method signature is matched. If the input target is not an `IntervalIndex`, we call the `get_indexer` directly without converting to another index. This approach ensures that the correct type signatures are matched during the method call and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
