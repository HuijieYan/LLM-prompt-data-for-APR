First, the `IntervalIndex` class contains two `get_indexer` methods, one without the `@Substitution` decorator and one with. This should be avoided because it can create confusion.

The bug here lies in the `get_indexer` method. Specifically, the error message indicates a problem with the signature of the method, pointing to the line `indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. This suggests that there are issues with the method signature in terms of the types of the arguments.

Looking at the GitHub issue, it's clear that this bug is causing a failure when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex of an IntervalIndex.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve revisiting the method signature and ensuring that it aligns with the expected input types.

The corrected version of the `get_indexer` method is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

     # ... rest of the logic remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, a pair of parentheses is added to the call `self.is_overlapping()` to ensure that it is treated as a method call, and the issue with the method signature should be resolved.
