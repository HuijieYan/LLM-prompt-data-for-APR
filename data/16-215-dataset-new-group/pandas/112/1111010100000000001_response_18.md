The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`. This function is responsible for returning an indexer array to be used in various operations on the interval index.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are likely to be in the conditional branches where the function handles different types of targets, such as when the target is an `IntervalIndex`, a homogeneous scalar index, or a heterogeneous scalar index.

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect handling of different cases and types when generating the indexer array. It's possible that certain conditions are not being properly checked, or that the logic for generating the indexer array is not correct in some cases, leading to incorrect results or errors.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully go through each conditional branch and ensure that the logic for generating the indexer array is correct for each case. This may involve checking for equality, handling different data types, and ensuring that the indexer array is generated accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype=np.intp)
            for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                    indexer[i] = loc
                except KeyError:
                    indexer[i] = -1
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for generating the indexer array has been updated to address potential issues, such as handling different data types and ensuring that equality checks are performed accurately. Additionally, incorrect conditional branches have been fixed to provide the correct indexer array for each case.
