The issue appears to be with the `get_indexer` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file, within the `IntervalIndex` class. When the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, it fails with a TypeError.

The `get_indexer` method is trying to call `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`, where `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. However, there is no matching signature found for the `get_indexer` call, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, a new signature matching the type of `target_as_index.values` should be added to the `get_indexer` method to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex. Then, the appropriate logic needs to be added to handle this type of input in the `get_indexer` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method to address the bug:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # existing logic remains the same
    elif is_categorical_dtype(target_as_index):
        # handle CategoricalIndex with specific logic
        index_array = ensure_platform_int(
            np.asarray(
                [self.get_loc(val) for val in target_as_index]
            )
        )
        return index_array
    else:
        # remaining logic for other cases

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, a new branch is added to the `get_indexer` method to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex. This branch ensures that the appropriate logic is executed for CategoricalIndex inputs, allowing the `round` method to work correctly when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `round` method works as expected when handling IntervalIndex columns within a DataFrame.
