The buggy function appears to be handling different types of arguments and conditions, such as overlapping indices and scalar indexes. 

The function is designed to check for overlapping indices, handle cases where the target index is the same as the current index, and deal with different closed or incompatible subtypes. It also applies different indexing approaches based on the type of index provided. 

From the given runtime values, it appears that the function is trying to match the target index with the current index and return the corresponding indexer values. However, there could be several potential error locations where the bug may arise.

One potential cause of the bug could be the conditional statements that check for index equality and handle different index types. It is also possible that the indexing logic within each conditional block is incorrect.

To fix the bug, you should carefully review the conditional logic and indexing approaches within each block to ensure that they correctly handle the different cases of index comparison and matching.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In this corrected version, the conditional logic and indexing approaches have been reviewed to ensure correct handling of the different cases of index comparison and matching.
