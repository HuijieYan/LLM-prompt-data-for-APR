The bug in the `get_indexer` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file is causing a TypeError when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex.

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test along with the corresponding error message, it seems that the bug is occurring due to an error in the `get_indexer` function. The error is raised when the `df.round()` method is called, and it specifically mentions a `TypeError: No matching signature found` in the `get_indexer` function in the `intervaltree.pxi` file.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function can handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with these indices.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, I've modified the logic flow and removed the part that was specific to IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex, as it seems to be causing a problem with the `round` method. After making these changes, it is expected that the `df.round()` method call will work as intended with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

This fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub as well.
