To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates that the TypeError is raised at line 964, where the `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` is called. This suggests that there is an issue with the way the `get_indexer` method is implemented.

The issue seems to be related to the `target_as_index` not being handled correctly. We need to ensure that the `target_as_index` is processed appropriately based on its type and subtype.

Therefore, a strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic for handling different types and subtypes of the `target_as_index`, including `IntervalIndex`, `CategoricalIndex`, and scalar indexes, to ensure that the `get_indexer` method acts appropriately for all these cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            else:
                # process based on the type and subtype of target_as_index
                if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
                    return np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
                elif isinstance(target_as_index, Index):
                    indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
                    return indexer
                else:
                    # handle scalar indexes
                    target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
                    indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

                    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
        else:
            # handle non-IntervalIndex cases (e.g., scalar indexes)
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we included additional logic to handle different types of `target_as_index`, such as `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`, as well as scalar indexes.

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now be able to handle correctly all the different cases of `target_as_index` and resolve the TypeError that was previously raised when calling `df.round()` on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
