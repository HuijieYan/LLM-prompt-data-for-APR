The error message indicates that there's a `TypeError` in the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class located in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`. 

Based on the error message, the problem is with the signature of the `get_indexer` method. The method is not recognized because of incorrect type hinting of its input argument `target`. 

To fix this bug, the type hinting of the `target` argument should be changed to `AnyArrayLike` to dynamically type the argument to be compatible with other methods and classes in the pandas library.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # rest of the method remains unchanged
```

By updating the type hint of the `target` argument to `AnyArrayLike`, it will allow flexibility in the input and fix the `TypeError`. This adjustment will ensure that the `get_indexer` method can accept a wider range of input types, making it compatible with the failing test.
