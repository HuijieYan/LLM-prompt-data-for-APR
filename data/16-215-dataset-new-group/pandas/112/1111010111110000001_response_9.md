The root cause of the error message is related to the `TypeError: No matching signature found` which indicates that there's a problem in the `get_indexer` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. 

Looking into the `get_indexer` function, it seems there's a problem with the signature for the `get_indexer` function. The issue is likely related to the type signature of the `target` parameter. The `scalar_t[:]` type hints need to be corrected.

To fix the bug, the type hints for the `target` parameter in the `get_indexer` function should be changed to `AnyArrayLike` instead of `scalar_t[:]`. The `AnyArrayLike` hint allows for a wide range of array-like inputs, including scalar types, lists, tuples, etc.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

Updating the type hint to `AnyArrayLike` should resolve the issue reported in the failing test.
