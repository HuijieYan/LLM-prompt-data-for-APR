The error message suggests that there is a problem with the function signature, specifically with the `target` parameter. 

The `get_indexer` function is expecting a 1-dimensional array-like input (`target`), but the error message indicates that it cannot find a matching signature for the input type `scalar_t[:]`. This indicates that the input type for `target` is not matching the expected type of a 1-dimensional array-like object.

Looking at the function's input parameters and variables at the return, it seems that the `target` parameter is being passed as an `IntervalIndex` object, which does not match the expected type.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `target` parameter is passed as a 1-dimensional array-like object.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)  # Ensure target is a valid index

    indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we first ensure that the `target` input is a valid index using the `ensure_index` function. Then, we directly pass `target_as_index.values` to the `_engine.get_indexer` function, as it is assumed that `ensure_index` will handle any necessary conversion to ensure that `target` is a 1-dimensional array-like object.
