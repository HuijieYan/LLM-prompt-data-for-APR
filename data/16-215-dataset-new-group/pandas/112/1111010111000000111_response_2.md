The potential error locations in the buggy function are the `get_indexer` method and the way it handles the input `target_as_index` when it is a categorical index made from an `IntervalIndex`. The failing test code demonstrates that the `round` method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an `IntervalIndex`. This relates to the GitHub issue as it specifically points out the problem when using the `round` method with a DataFrame where the columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

The bug occurs within the `get_indexer` method when it tries to handle input `target_as_index` that is a categorical index made from an `IntervalIndex`. The code does not account for this scenario and as a result, it fails to handle the operation correctly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle the case where `target_as_index` is a categorical index made from an `IntervalIndex` differently, ensuring that the `get_indexer` method is able to handle this scenario and works as expected.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            # Handle the case when the target is CategoricalIndex
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
            indexer = self.get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
        elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle the case when the target is IntervalIndex
            # rest of the logic remains unchanged from the original implementation
            ...

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`. If it is, we extract the categories and call the `get_indexer` method recursively to handle the case when the target is a CategoricalIndex. If the target remains an IntervalIndex, the original implementation is used as it is. This change should ensure that the `get_indexer` method can handle the input correctly and pass the failing test.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and pass the failing test. It provides a more robust handling of different types of input to the `get_indexer` method, including the specific case of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
