There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `self.is_overlapping` condition inside the function is not calling the `is_overlapping` method, it's missing the parentheses to execute the method.
2. There are issues with the conditional blocks and their associated error messages. The wrong numpy functions are used.
3. The checking whether a target is an `IntervalIndex` doesn't seem to be right. It should not compare them based on objects and object attributes.

The cause of the bug is a combination of incorrect conditional logic and method execution.
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Correctly execute the `is_overlapping` method.
- Use the correct numpy functions for the conditional branches based on the instructions provided.
- Change the conditional code for checking if the target is an `IntervalIndex` to compare them properly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(-1, len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key, method=method, tolerance=tolerance) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version, the method `is_overlapping` is correctly called with `self.is_overlapping()`, and the appropriate numpy functions are used based on the conditional branches in the function. Furthermore, the logic for checking if the target is an `IntervalIndex` has been updated to compare them properly.
