## Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring because the `get_indexer` function is not handling columns with a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly. It is causing a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with such columns.

The issue seems to stem from the function's failure to correctly handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `get_indexer` function to properly handle columns with a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve checking the type of the index and pivoting the logic accordingly to ensure that the `round` method works as expected.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The corrected function with the bug fixed
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        # handle both IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex
        indexer = np.argsort(target_as_index.astype('str'))  # handle the categorical index
    else:
        # handle other cases
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the logic to handle a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` has been added. It checks if the `target_as_index` is either an `IntervalIndex` or a `CategoricalIndex`, and then handles both cases appropriately to ensure the `round` method works as expected.
