The bug is in the `get_indexer` function inside the `IntervalIndex` class of the pandas package. The failing test is trying to use the `round` function on a data frame with a `CategoricalIndex` containing intervals. This leads to a call to the `get_indexer` method for the `IntervalIndex` class which then fails with a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the implementation of the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class, specifically in the part where it checks whether `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. There might be issues with type conversion and dtype mismatch leading to the `TypeError` during the call to `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` in the `get_indexer` function.

To fix the bug, it's important to narrow down the issue by isolating the problematic type conversion and dtype checks when working with `target_as_index` in the `get_indexer` function. Additionally, verifying that the `target_as_index` and the actual data type being used are compatible can help resolve this `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# Other imports (not shown in the code snippet)
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
import pandas.core.indexes.interval as interval

# corrected get_indexer function
@Substitution( ...
# unchanged parameters
)
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = interval.ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, interval.IntervalIndex):
        return super().get_indexer(target_as_index, method, limit, tolerance)

    return super().get_indexer(target, method, limit, tolerance)
```
In this version, we've added a check on whether target_as_index is an instance of interval.IntervalIndex and handled the call to the inherited implementation of get_indexer accordingly. This should ensure proper type conversion and dtype matching and address the TypeError.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
