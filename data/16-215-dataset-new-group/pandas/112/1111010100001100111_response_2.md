The cause of the bug is that when the buggy function `get_indexer` is called, it fails to properly handle the case when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to the `round` method failing. This is due to the method not being able to find a matching signature for this specific case.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function should be modified to properly handle the case when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if is_categorical_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remainder of the original code remains unchanged
```

The fix includes adding a check for when the `target_as_index` is a categorical index. In this case, it's converted to using its categories before proceeding to the original logic. This modification will help to handle the specific case when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, thereby resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
