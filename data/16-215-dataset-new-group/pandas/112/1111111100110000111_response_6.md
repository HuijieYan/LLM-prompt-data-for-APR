The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the `TypeError: No matching signature found` error that is coming from the `get_indexer` method. The issue on GitHub indicates that the `round` method fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. 

Looking at the `get_indexer` method, it seems that the bug lies in the method signatures and input parameters. The error message indicates a problem with the signature of the `get_indexer` method. This suggests that the input parameters or their types might not match the expected signature.

To fix the bug, the signature of the `get_indexer` method needs to be checked and corrected to avoid the `TypeError` that is being encountered. In particular, the `scalar_t[:]` type annotation for the `target` parameter seems to be causing the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# Fix the signature of the get_indexer method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # Rest of the method's implementation
```

By correcting the type annotation for the `target` parameter to `AnyArrayLike`, the bug related to the method signature issue should be resolved. This should also address the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue related to the `round` method failing when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
