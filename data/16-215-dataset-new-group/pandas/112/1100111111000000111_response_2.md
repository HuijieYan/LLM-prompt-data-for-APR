To fix the bug, it is necessary to identify the root cause of the failure in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. Upon analysis, it seems that the buggy function is not handling the case when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug seems to stem from an inconsistency in the handling of `CategoricalIndex` columns in the `DataFrame`. When the `CategoricalIndex` is constructed from an `IntervalIndex`, the `round` method fails to handle the `CategoricalIndex` columns properly, leading to the error `TypeError: No matching signature found`.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class needs to be modified to handle the scenario where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The current implementation does not properly handle this scenario, leading to the failure of the `round` method when columns are of this type.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle CategoricalIndex made from IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    # rest of the original implementation...
}
```

By adding the condition to handle the case when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the bug causing the failure of the `round` method should be resolved. This fix ensures that the `get_indexer` method properly handles the scenario and allows the `round` method to work as expected when columns are of this type.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and enable the `round` method to function as normal when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
