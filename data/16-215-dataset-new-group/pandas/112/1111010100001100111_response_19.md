The bug in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class is causing issues when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, particularly affecting the `round` method when applied to a DataFrame with such columns.

Potential error locations within the `get_indexer` function:
1. The logic for handling overlapping indices.
2. The differentiation between homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.
3. The implementation of the `get_indexer` method for different types of input.

Cause of the bug:
The bug may be due to improper handling of overlapping indices and differentiating between homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes. The failure to properly handle inputs of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex is likely due to incorrect logic in these areas.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the logic for handling overlapping indices and differentiating between homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes is correct.
2. Ensure that the `get_indexer` method can handle various types of input, including CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
3. Verify that the return values are correctly handled and appropriate data types are used throughout the function.

Based on the analysis and the specific GitHub issue, here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):  # Check for CategoricalIndex
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains the same
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, additional handling for CategoricalIndex is added to ensure proper processing of such input. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and improve the overall functionality of the `get_indexer` method for IntervalIndex.
