The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely causing the issue described in the GitHub report. The function is responsible for handling index matching and is used widely in pandas for operations involving indices.

The potential error locations in the `get_indexer` function include:
1. The section where `IndexError` is being caught and a default value of -1 is returned, which might be leading to the failure in the `round` method when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
2. The section where `IntervalTree` is being used to handle homogeneous scalar index might be causing issues with categorical indices.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the function not properly handling CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to improve the handling of CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex in the function by ensuring that the matching and indexing operations are compatible with these types of indices.
2. We may need to provide specific handling for CategoricalIndex when using the `IntervalTree` to ensure it can handle homogeneous scalar indices properly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        # handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we specifically handle the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex, and then proceed with the indexing operations as before. This improvement should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
