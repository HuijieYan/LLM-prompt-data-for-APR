To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the issue is related to the `IntervalIndex` columns being converted to `CategoricalIndex`, which causes the `round` method to fail. The `get_indexer` method is responsible for handling the conversion of the target index to an integer indexer. 

Looking at the failing test case and the runtime values, it appears that the error is related to the datatype mismatches and conversion issues when using CategoricalIndex with IntervalIndex columns.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the conversion from a CategoricalIndex to an IntervalIndex properly, ensuring that the dtypes and values are handled correctly. Additionally, we need to add checks for CategoricalIndex columns and handle the conversion accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# modified get_indexer method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle conversion from CategoricalIndex to IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex.from_intervals(target_as_index.categories)

    # Rest of the method remains the same
    # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case when the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` by converting it to an `IntervalIndex` using `pd.IntervalIndex.from_intervals`. This approach ensures that any issues related to dtype mismatches and conversion problems are addressed.

After applying this fix, the `round` method should work as expected for `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex`.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and should resolve the failing test case.
