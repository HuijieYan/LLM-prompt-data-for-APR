The buggy function in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file appears to be the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. The purpose of this function is to generate an indexer array for the given target array-like input.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic for handling overlapping indices, performing positional matches, and dealing with different closed or incompatible subtypes. There are also potential issues in the handling of different types of target inputs, such as IntervalIndex, homogeneous scalar index, and heterogeneous scalar index.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of overlapping indices and the logic for determining matches between different index types. This is evident from the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` where the `get_indexer` function does not produce the expected result when used in the context of rounding interval category columns.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling overlapping indices and determining matches between different index types needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially rewritten. Additionally, the handling of different target input types should be revisited to ensure that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            else:
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                    indexer.append(loc)
                except KeyError:
                    indexer.append(-1)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(np.array(indexer))
```

In the corrected version, changes have been made to ensure that the `is_overlapping()` function is properly called to check for overlapping indices. The logic for handling different target input types has also been revised to correctly generate the indexer array based on the target values.

After applying these changes, the `get_indexer` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
