The potential cause of the bug in the `get_indexer` function is that it fails to handle the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This causes the `round` method to fail when applied to the DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function should be modified to handle the case where the input is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. Specifically, it should be updated to handle the different data types and indices that might be encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        return target_as_index
    else:
        # Handle other types of indices or data types
        # ...
```

In this corrected version, we have added a condition to handle the case where `target_as_index` is either an `IntervalIndex` or a `CategoricalIndex`. If it is, we simply return `target_as_index`. If it's a different type of index or data type, we need to handle it accordingly.

With this modification, the `get_indexer` function should be able to handle the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly, and the `round` method should work as expected.
