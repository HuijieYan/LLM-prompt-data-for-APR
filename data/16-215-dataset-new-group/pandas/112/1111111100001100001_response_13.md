The bug in the provided function appears to be related to the handling of an IntervalIndex object, specifically when checking for overlap and obtaining indexers. 

The function attempts to check for overlap between the self IntervalIndex and the target IntervalIndex. It then proceeds to obtain indexers based on whether the target is an IntervalIndex or a scalar index, by checking its dtype and closed attributes.

The bug likely lies in the comparisons and conditions used to obtain the indexers, particularly when dealing with interval overlaps and different types of indexers (e.g., scalar vs. IntervalIndex).

To fix the bug, it's necessary to carefully review the logic used for handling overlap checks and obtaining indexers for different types of indexes. It's also important to ensure that the comparisons and conditions are correctly evaluating the overlaps and obtaining the indexers based on the interval attributes.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        else:
            indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly checks for overlap using the `is_overlapping()` method, and adjusts the conditions and comparisons accordingly to obtain the indexers based on the interval attributes. Additionally, the logic for handling scalar indexes has been adjusted to ensure correct indexer assignments based on the presence of keys in the IntervalIndex.
