The bug in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class results in the `round` method failing when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`. The function is responsible for handling indexers for specific target data, and the bug causes incorrect handling or interpretation of the input target data.

### Bug Analysis
The function `get_indexer` examines the `target` input to determine its properties and how it relates to the index, including overlaps, compatibility, or whether it is a scalar or interval data. The various conditionals and type validations in the function indicate that the bug could arise from incorrect handling of the different types of data and the comparisons between the left/right indices of the `IntervalIndex`.

In the failing test, the `IntervalIndex` is used as columns in a DataFrame, leading to the `round` method failing. This is consistent with the input and validation process of the `get_indexer` function, which may incorrectly determine the indexer for the interval columns.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the function incorrectly assuming the properties of the `IntervalIndex` and failing to identify its compatibility with the target data. This leads to incorrect outputs or errors, as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `IntervalIndex` and its properties, ensuring proper comparison and compatibility checks with the target data. Additionally, the handling of scalar and interval data should be accurate to avoid errors.

### Corrected Function
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # existing code...

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if not isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) and not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # handle homogeneous scalar index
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # handle any other cases, including heterogeneous scalar index
        indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

The corrected function ensures proper handling of both the target and the index to accurately determine the indexer. This should resolve the issue and the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.

After making this change, it's important to run the failing test again to ensure that the bug is fixed and the `round` method for `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` columns functions as expected.
