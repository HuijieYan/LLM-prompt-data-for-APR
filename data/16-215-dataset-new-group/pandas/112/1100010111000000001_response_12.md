The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file seems to be failing when trying to handle overlapping indices. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is related to rounding interval category columns.

The potential error locations within the `get_indexer` function could be the logic to handle overlapping indices and the use of `self.equals(target_as_index)` to check for equal indexes.

The cause of the bug seems to be with the logic to handle overlapping indices, as the function is not properly handling the overlapping case, leading to the `InvalidIndexError` being raised. Additionally, the logic to check for equal indexes might also not be working as intended.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to improve the logic for handling overlapping indices and the equality check for indexes.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # other logic remains as is
        ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for overlapping indices and made a call to `self.get_indexer_non_unique` in case of overlapping indices. This helps in handling the overlapping case properly and avoids raising the `InvalidIndexError`.
