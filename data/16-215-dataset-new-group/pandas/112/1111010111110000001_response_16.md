The provided buggy function is `get_indexer()` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the pandas package. The function is designed to return index labels for the input target values, but it has some issues that are causing the test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` to fail.

The failing test case involves creating a DataFrame with interval columns and then applying the `round` method to it, which triggers the faulty `get_indexer` method.

Looking at the error message, it appears that the bug is related to a TypeError with no matching signature found.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` function is identified in the `target_as_index.values` attribute. It is likely that the `values` attribute is not being handled properly for `target_as_index`.

The cause of this bug is that the `get_indexer` method is expecting a scalar target as input, but it is receiving a collection of target values due to the `target_as_index.values` attribute.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle the case where `target_as_index` is a collection of values, instead of a scalar.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Code for handling IntervalIndex case
            # ...
        
        elif is_list_like(target_as_index) and not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # Code for handling collection of values, i.e., list-like input
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
            
        else:
            # Default case, handle other situations
            # ...
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to handle the case where `target_as_index` is list-like and not object dtype, which allows for handling the collection of values properly. This should resolve the TypeError with no matching signature found.
