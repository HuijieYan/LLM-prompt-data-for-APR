The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to handling IntervalIndex objects and their attributes. Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the bug may be related to the comparison and manipulation of IntervalIndex objects.

The relevant classes and methods involved in this bug are:
- `IntervalIndex` class, containing attributes `closed`, `left`, `right`, `dtype`, and method `is_overlapping`
- `IntervalTree` class, possibly used within the `get_indexer` function for handling IntervalIndex objects
- `IntervalArray` class, representing the values of the IntervalIndex

The GitHub issue demonstrates a specific scenario where the `round` method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This suggests that there might be an issue with handling IntervalIndex objects in certain operations, such as rounding.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that operations involving IntervalIndex objects, particularly in the `get_indexer` function, are handled correctly to prevent unexpected errors.

Based on the analysis and the GitHub issue, a potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve:
- Ensuring that the comparison and manipulation of IntervalIndex objects are accurate and consistent, particularly in scenarios where operations such as rounding are involved.
- Checking for any discrepancies in the handling of IntervalIndex objects in different contexts, such as when used in CategoricalIndex or other operations.

Based on the identified potential issues and the suggested strategy, here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed: Call the is_overlapping method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # perform interval comparisons and indexing
        indexer = self._interval_index_get_indexer(target_as_index)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # fallback to standard indexing
        indexer = self._default_get_indexer(target_as_index)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the `is_overlapping` method is properly called with parentheses `is_overlapping()` to ensure that the method is invoked. Additionally, the handling of different scenarios for indexing operations based on the type of target index is improved to address any potential discrepancies.

By implementing these corrections, the function should behave more reliably and be able to handle IntervalIndex objects and related operations more consistently.
