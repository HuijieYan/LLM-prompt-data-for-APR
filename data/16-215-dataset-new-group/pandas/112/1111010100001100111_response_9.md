The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely causing issues when working with `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, resulting in unexpected errors like the one described in the GitHub issue.

The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the target index when it is an `IntervalIndex`. It fails to handle matching operations correctly and may not return expected results. The check for overlapping indices also seems to be incorrectly implemented.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly handles the comparison and matching operations for the `IntervalIndex`. Specifically, we need to address the logic related to handling `IntervalIndex` separately from other index types and ensure that the matching is performed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if (
                self.closed != target_as_index.closed
                or is_object_dtype(common_subtype)
            ):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        else:
            indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that when the target index is an `IntervalIndex`, the comparison and matching operations are performed correctly, taking into account the left and right endpoints of the intervals. When the target index is not an `IntervalIndex`, we delegate the operation to the base class's `get_indexer` method.

This fix should address the issues related to handling `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and ensure that the `round` method works as expected, resolving the problem described in the GitHub issue.
