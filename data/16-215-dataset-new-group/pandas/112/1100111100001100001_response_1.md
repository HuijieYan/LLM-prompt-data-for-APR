The buggy function appears to be `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is intended to return an indexer array to map the target intervals to the intervals in the index. 

From the provided runtime values and types, we can see that the function is checking for overlapping indexes and then trying to handle different cases based on the type of `target`. However, the code seems to be incorrectly handling `IntervalIndex` as `target`.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the function incorrectly handles the case when `target` is an `IntervalIndex`. Instead of checking for equality and performing operations specific to `IntervalIndex`, the function seems to be directly treating `target` as an ordinary index.

The strategy to fix the bug would involve correctly handling the `IntervalIndex` case and ensuring that the operations performed are appropriate for the type of index being processed.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Imports omitted for brevity

class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # Other functions and methods as before

    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        if isinstance(target, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle IntervalIndex specially
            if self.equals(target):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            
            common_dtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target.dtype.subtype])
            if self.closed != target.closed or is_object_dtype(common_dtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target))

            # Additional operations specific to IntervalIndex
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        else:
            # Continue with the existing logic for non-IntervalIndex targets
            # ...
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have explicitly handled the case where `target` is an `IntervalIndex` and performed appropriate operations specific to `IntervalIndex`.

This should resolve the bug and handle the case when `target` is an `IntervalIndex` correctly.
