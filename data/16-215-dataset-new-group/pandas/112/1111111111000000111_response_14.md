Based on the provided information, the bug in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class is likely causing the `round` method to fail when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug seems to stem from the condition `if self.is_overlapping`, which does not check for the method argument `None` and raises an error if any method other than the default `None` is specified. This may lead to the `InvalidIndexError` being raised, causing the `round` method to fail.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function should be modified to handle the method argument appropriately and address the handling of `is_overlapping`.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# other imports

class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # ... other functions ...

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        if method and method.lower() != 'none':
            raise NotImplementedError("Method arguments other than None are not yet implemented")

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...
    
```

In this corrected version, the function now includes a check for the `method` argument to ensure that non-default method arguments are appropriately handled. Additionally, the `is_overlapping` check was modified to include the parentheses `self.is_overlapping()` to properly call the method.

With these fixes, the `round` method should now work as expected when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
