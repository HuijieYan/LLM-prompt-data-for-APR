The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`. The function is attempting to get an indexer for target indices, but there are several issues within the function that may be causing the problem described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug might be that the `get_indexer` method is not handling cases where the index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This could lead to the failure of the `round` method for such columns.

To fix the bug, one potential strategy would be to modify the implementation of the `get_indexer` method to handle `CategoricalIndex` cases created from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This might involve improving the logic for handling heterogeneous scalar indices and ensuring that the method can handle cases where the index is a `CategoricalIndex` resulting from an `IntervalIndex`.

Taking the GitHub issue and potential bug cause into consideration, here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
            # Handle CategoricalIndex made from IntervalIndex
            indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
        else:
            if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
                # The rest of the implementation remains the same as before
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This correction introduces a specific handling for `CategoricalIndex` instances created from `IntervalIndex` instances. It uses the `get_indexer` method directly on the `CategoricalIndex` in this case.

This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report and allow the `round` method to work as expected for `CategoricalIndex` instances created from `IntervalIndex` instances.
