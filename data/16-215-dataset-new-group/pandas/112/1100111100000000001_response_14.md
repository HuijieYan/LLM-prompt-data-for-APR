The bug in the given code is a `TypeError: 'staticmethod' object is not callable`, raised at the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. This bug occurs because the `is_overlapping` method was mistakenly called as a property rather than a method.

To fix this bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called using parentheses to treat it as a method, rather than an attribute. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/interval.py

# Rest of the functions remain unchanged

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():  # Call is_overlapping as a method
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

```

By making this change, the `TypeError: 'staticmethod' object is not callable` bug should be resolved.
