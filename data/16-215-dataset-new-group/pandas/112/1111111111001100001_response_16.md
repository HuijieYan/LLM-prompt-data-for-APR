The buggy function appears to be the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is intended to return an indexer array that can be used to extract elements from the index. 

The potential error locations within the function could be in the conditional statements that check the type of `target_as_index`. There might also be an issue with the implementation of the conditional logic for different types of `target_as_index`.

The cause of the bug could be related to the conditional logic that handles different types of `target_as_index`. It seems that the conditional logic might not be correctly identifying the type of `target_as_index` and consequently, the incorrect path of execution may be taken.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review and revise the conditional statements, ensuring that the correct path of execution is taken based on the type of `target_as_index` and that the operations within each conditional branch are accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed or self.dtype.subtype != target_as_index.dtype.subtype:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index], dtype='intp')

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, I added a missing `()` in the `if self.is_overlapping` condition to call the function. I also modified the conditions inside the first conditional block to properly compare `self.dtype.subtype` with `target_as_index.dtype.subtype`. Additionally, I revised the logic inside the `else` block to create an array of indexers for heterogeneous scalar indices using a list comprehension and then converted it to a numpy array with the correct dtype.
