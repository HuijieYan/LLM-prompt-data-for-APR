The bug appears to be caused by an issue with the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message suggests that there is a `TypeError` occurring due to no matching signature being found.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are likely where a scalar value is being passed to `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`. It seems that there is an issue with the signature of the `get_indexer` method.

The cause of the bug is that the function may be expecting a specific type of input, and the signature mismatch is causing it to fail with a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `target_as_index.values` parameter being passed to `_engine.get_indexer()` is of the correct type.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None,
                limit: Optional[int] = None,
                tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code stays the same
    else:
        # fix the type of input being passed to _engine.get_indexer
        if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            if is_numeric_dtype(target_as_index.dtype) and target_as_index.ndim == 1:
                target_as_index = target_as_index.view('i8')
                indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
            else:
                raise TypeError("Input must be one-dimensional and numeric")
        else:
            # remaining code stays the same
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version includes a fix for the type of input being passed to `_engine.get_indexer`, ensuring that the input is one-dimensional and numeric when using `_engine.get_indexer`. This should resolve the `TypeError` occurring due to no matching signature being found.
