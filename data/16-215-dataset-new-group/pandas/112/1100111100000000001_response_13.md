Looking at the given code, the buggy function `get_indexer` seems to be attempting to get the indexer for the target based on the IntervalIndex. Potential error locations within this function are:

1. Error in checking the method using `self._check_method(method)` method.
2. Incorrect use of the `is_overlapping` attribute.
3. Handling of different types of indexes including IntervalIndex, scalar index, and object dtype index.

The cause of the bug might be due to the incorrect usage of the `is_overlapping` attribute, as well as potential problems with handling different types of indexes and checking the 'method'. Therefore, a strategy for fixing the bug would involve:
- Correctly using the `is_overlapping` attribute to check for overlapping indices.
- Handling different types of indexes, including IntervalIndex, scalar index, and object dtype index.
- Ensuring the validation and handling of the 'method' argument are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        if method is not None:
            raise NotImplementedError(
                "Any method argument other than the default of None is not yet implemented."
            )
            
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = [self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index]
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In the corrected version, `self.is_overlapping` has been replaced with `self.is_overlapping()`, and methods like `left`, `right`, and `_engine` have been called using `self` to obtain the expected results. Additionally, method validation has been corrected based on the parameter `method` passed.
