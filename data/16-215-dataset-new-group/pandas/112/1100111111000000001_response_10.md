The buggy function has an issue with the logic that handles overlapping indices. When the function encounters overlapping indices, it raises an error and does not handle the case properly. This is causing the failing test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling overlapping indices. When encountering overlapping indices, the function should use `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique` instead of raising an error.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function will now properly handle overlapping indices and pass the failing test.
