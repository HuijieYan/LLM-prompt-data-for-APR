The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test is testing the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`. The error message indicates a "No matching signature found" error with a `TypeError`. The bug seems to occur when the `get_indexer` method is called with a target that is a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`. 

The potential error location is within the `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex)` conditional block, as this is the part of the code that deals specifically with `IntervalIndex` instances.

The bug seems to be caused by the `get_indexer` method not handling `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex` correctly. It is likely failing to find a matching signature when trying to extract the indexer from the target indices.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `get_indexer` method to correctly handle the case where the target is a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`. This may involve adjusting the logic for extracting the indexer or adding a specific handling case for this scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the original code]
``` 

In the corrected version, the code checks if the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` and if its categories are of type `IntervalIndex`, then it sets the target index to be the categories directly. This ensures that the `get_indexer` method will correctly handle the target index when it is a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
