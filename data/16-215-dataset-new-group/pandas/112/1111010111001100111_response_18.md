The issue seems to be related to the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The failing test calls the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns being a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and it fails with a TypeError.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue may be related to the implementation of the `get_indexer` method when dealing with an IntervalIndex. The method is not handling the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle the case of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# Modified and corrected version of the get_indexer method
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # ... existing code ...

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.astype(self)
        indexer = self._encode_target(target_as_index)
    else:
        # ... existing code ...
        pass

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we introduce a check for the `target_as_index` being a CategoricalIndex with categories being an IntervalIndex. If this condition is met, we convert the `target_as_index` to the same type as `self` using `astype` method and then encode the target as needed.

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now handle the case of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly, and the failing test should pass.

After applying this correction, re-run the failing test to ensure that the bug has been fixed.
