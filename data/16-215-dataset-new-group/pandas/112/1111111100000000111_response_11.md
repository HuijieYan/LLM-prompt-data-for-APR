Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function provided, it seems that the issue occurs when trying to use the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns consisting of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The problem is specifically related to the handling of the `IntervalIndex` columns when applying the `round` method.

The buggy function has a section that is responsible for handling different types of `target_as_index` when retrieving the indexer. The issue might be occurring due to incorrect handling of the `target_as_index` that is a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`.

To resolve this issue, it is important to ensure that the `target_as_index` is correctly handled for the `CategoricalIndex`. One potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle the `CategoricalIndex` derived from the `IntervalIndex` differently from other types of index in the function. 

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function with the potential fix:
```python
# ... (other code remains the same)

def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index._data, IntervalIndex):
        # handle CategoricalIndex derived from IntervalIndex
        indexer = np.arange(len(self))  # Apply round directly without conversion
    
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        # ... (other code remains the same)
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected function, special handling has been added for `target_as_index` that is a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. We directly return the index range (`np.arange(len(self)`) instead of performing any additional conversion or operations.

This should ensure that the `round` method works as expected for the `CategoricalIndex` derived from `IntervalIndex`, resolving the issue described on the GitHub.
