The bug in the provided code is that the condition `if self.is_overlapping` is incorrect. This is because `self.is_overlapping` is a reference to the method `is_overlapping` rather than calling the method to get the actual result. 

To fix this bug, we need to call the method `is_overlapping` with appropriate arguments and use the result of the method call in the condition.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the corrected function will correctly call the `is_overlapping` method and use its result to handle overlapping indices.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test provided.
