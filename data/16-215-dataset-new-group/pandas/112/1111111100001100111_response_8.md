The bug in the given function is likely to be related to the logical conditions and comparisons within the function. It appears to handle the case where the target index is an IntervalIndex, but the implementation may not be handling it correctly based on the reported issue related to rounding method failures when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The function is comparing different attributes and values related to IntervalIndex, such as self.is_overlapping, self.closed, left and right indexes, and interval values. It also handles cases where the target index is an IntervalIndex or a homogeneous scalar index.

Based on the reported issue, it seems that the function may not be correctly handling the case of columns being CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a TypeError when trying to use the round method.

To fix this bug, it would be necessary to revisit the logic of the function and ensure that it handles all possible types of input indexes, including the reported case of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The logic for comparing and finding matching elements should be thoroughly reviewed and potentially revised to address the reported issue.

Here is a corrected version of the function, addressing the identified issues:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    if method is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError("Only the default method is supported")

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            # Flatten CategoricalIndex to get the underlying IntervalIndex
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
        # rest of the code remains the same as the original 

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In this corrected version, we first ensure that only the default method is allowed and then handle the special case of CategoricalIndex by flattening it to get the underlying IntervalIndex. This should handle the reported issue and improve the function's behavior with respect to different index types.
