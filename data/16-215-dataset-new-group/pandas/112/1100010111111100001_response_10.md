The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` which suggests that the `get_indexer` function may be receiving incorrect input types or values. Additionally, the `ensure_platform_int` function suggests that the output type may also be incorrect.

Upon analysis of the provided runtime values, it appears that the `get_indexer` function might be receiving correct input types and values. However, the return type of the `get_indexer` function is not explicitly mentioned in the function definition, and it is not clear whether the `ensure_platform_int` function is handling the return type correctly.

Given the above analysis, the bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of the return type in the `get_indexer` function.

To fix the bug, the return type of the `get_indexer` function should be explicitly specified. Additionally, the `ensure_platform_int` function should be used to handle the return type correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> Union[np.ndarray, int]:
    # existing code...
```

In the corrected version, the return type of the `get_indexer` function is explicitly specified as `Union[np.ndarray, int]` to indicate that the function should return either a NumPy array or an integer. Additionally, the use of the `ensure_platform_int` function for handling the return type should be ensured within the function.
