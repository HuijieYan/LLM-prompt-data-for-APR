The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class from the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file fails the test `test_round_interval_category_columns` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_analytics.py` file.

Upon analyzing the code, we see that the buggy function is attempting to perform some operations involving intervals, and it seems to be having trouble handling overlapping intervals.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the improper handling of overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function. When the intervals in the `target_as_index` are overlapping, the function is throwing an `InvalidIndexError` instead of handling the overlap properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function to properly address the overlap and perform the necessary operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method)

    return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In the corrected version, when the `is_overlapping` condition is encountered, it calls `get_indexer_non_unique` to properly handle overlapping intervals. If the intervals are not overlapping, it falls back to the default behavior by calling the `get_indexer` function in the base class.

By making this change, the corrected function should now handle overlapping indices correctly and pass the failing test.
