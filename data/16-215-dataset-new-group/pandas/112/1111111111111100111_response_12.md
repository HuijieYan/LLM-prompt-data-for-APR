The bug is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The method is intended to return an array of index positions for corresponding values in the input `target`, based on the intervals of the `IntervalIndex`. However, the bug causes a `TypeError` due to a missing or incorrect signature for the function.

The cause of the bug is related to the way the `target` input is being processed. It seems that the method is getting confused when the `target` is an `IntervalIndex` and is attempting to match it with the intervals of the `self` index. This confusion leads to the incorrect signature error and subsequent failure of the tests.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to revisit the implementation of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, ensure that the method can correctly handle `IntervalIndex` as the `target` input while calculating the index positions based on the intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        # Handle other cases as per the existing implementation
        # ...
```

In the corrected version, if the `target` is an `IntervalIndex` and it's not equal to the `self` index, it will return an array of `-1` values, indicating no matches.

By making this change, the `get_indexer` method should be able to handle `IntervalIndex` as the `target` input, and the tests should pass without the `TypeError` occurring.
