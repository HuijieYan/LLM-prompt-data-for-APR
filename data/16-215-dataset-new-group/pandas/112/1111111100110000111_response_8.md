To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, we need to address the error caused by the TypeError: No matching signature found. This error is likely occurring due to a mismatch in the signature of the `get_indexer` method.

The bug in the `get_indexer` function may originate from the way it handles the target data of type `Scalar`, and potentially due to issues in the method arguments.

Based on the provided context, I recommend revisiting the signature of the `get_indexer` method and ensuring that it matches the expected input type. Additionally, we should check the target data type and ensure that it is compatible with the method's signature.

The corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = ("cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
               "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique")
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index]
        indexer = np.array(indexer)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version:

1. Explicit method calls have been added for `self.is_overlapping()`, `self.left()`, `self.right()`, and `self._engine()`.
2. The method calls have been corrected to use parentheses to ensure that the functions are actually being called.
3. The step to handle non-overlapping, scalar indices has been replaced with a list comprehension for better clarity and correctness.

By making these changes, we ensure that the `get_indexer` method matches its expected signature and correctly handles the target input. This should resolve the TypeError and fix the bug.

Please note that the corrected implementation may need to be further tested in the context of the original bug report and associated test cases to ensure that it behaves as expected.
