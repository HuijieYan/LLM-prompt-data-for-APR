The cause of the bug in the provided function is the use of the `self.is_overlapping` attribute for conditional checking. The bug occurs because `self.is_overlapping` is used without function call parentheses, which results in checking the method itself rather than its return value.

To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called with parentheses to obtain its return value for conditional checking purposes.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the is_overlapping method
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```
