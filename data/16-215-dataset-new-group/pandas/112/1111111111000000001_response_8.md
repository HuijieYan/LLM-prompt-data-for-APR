The bug seems to be in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. It is failing to correctly handle a case of comparing two `IntervalIndex` objects for exact matches. This is evident from the failing test function `test_round_interval_category_columns` which creates a DataFrame with `CategoricalIndex` based on `interval_range` and then rounds it.

The most likely cause of the bug is that the `equals` comparison in the `get_indexer` method is failing to correctly identify exact matches between two `IntervalIndex` objects, leading to incorrect results and the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method needs to be implemented correctly to handle exact matches between two `IntervalIndex` objects. Additionally, the logic used for exact matching within the `get_indexer` method should be reviewed and corrected if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        # Add the rest of the logic for matching here...

    # Rest of the method...
```

By properly implementing the `equals` method and adjusting the logic used for exact matching within the `get_indexer` method, the bug should be fixed. After applying these changes, re-run the failing test to ensure that the corrected version passes the test.
