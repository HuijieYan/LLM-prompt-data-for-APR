Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is returning an incorrect result when `target` is an `IntervalIndex`, causing the `round` method to fail when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The potential error locations within the `get_indexer` function are in the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` as `target`. Specifically, the comparison and assignment of `indexer` based on left and right get_indexer results might be causing the issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` function is not correctly handling `IntervalIndex` as the target and is producing incorrect results for the indexer.

To fix the bug, a suggestion would be to revise the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` as the target in the `get_indexer` function. This may involve reviewing the comparison and assignment of `indexer` based on left and right get_indexer results, as well as ensuring proper handling of `IntervalIndex` for the `round` method when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Given the buggy function and the information provided, here is the corrected version:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By revising the logic and handling the `IntervalIndex` target cases appropriately, this corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the `round` method works as expected when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
