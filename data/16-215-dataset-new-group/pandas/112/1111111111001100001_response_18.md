The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the logic for handling overlapping indices and matching intervals. Based on the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it is evident that the logic for handling overlapping indices is not properly implemented. When `self.is_overlapping` is False, the code is supposed to handle non-overlapping indices, but there are issues with the condition checks and branching logic.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices, ensuring that the correct comparisons and checks are done to determine the appropriate behavior for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            # handle non-overlapping indices
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if (self.closed == target_as_index.closed) and not is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
                right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
                indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    else:
        if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices has been clarified and adjusted to ensure that the correct comparisons and checks are performed to determine the appropriate behavior for each case. This should resolve the issues with the failing test case.
