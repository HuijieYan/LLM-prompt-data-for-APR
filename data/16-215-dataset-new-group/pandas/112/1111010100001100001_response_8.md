The bug in the function is likely due to an incorrect implementation of the logic for finding the indexers of the target intervals within the IntervalIndex. The code seems to be attempting to find matches between the intervals based on their left and right boundaries.

The bug may be related to how the intervals and their boundaries are compared and matched. There are also conditional checks for different types of indexes and data, which may not be handling all cases properly.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve reviewing the logic for comparing and matching intervals, ensuring that the comparisons are done correctly for different types of indexes and intervals. Additionally, handling of different data types should also be checked to ensure proper matching.

Given the runtime values and types of the input parameters and the variables right before the function's return, the corrected version of the function could involve refactoring the logic for comparing and matching intervals, as well as handling different data types properly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        else:
            indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
            for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                    indexer[i] = loc
                except KeyError:
                    indexer[i] = -1
    
        return indexer
```

In this corrected version, the logic for matching intervals has been revised to ensure correct comparisons and handling of different types of indexes and data. The function now properly handles different scenarios and should produce the correct results.
