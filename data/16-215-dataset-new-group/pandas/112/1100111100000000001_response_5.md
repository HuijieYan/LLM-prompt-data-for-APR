Based on the provided code, the buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class. The function appears to be causing a bug because it is not handling overlapping indices properly and is raising an `InvalidIndexError`.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. The condition `if self.is_overlapping` is being checked incorrectly. It should be called as a method to check if the intervals are overlapping.
2. There is an improper use of the `InvalidIndexError` message. It should be correctly guiding the user to use `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique` instead of raising an error directly.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of overlapping indices and improper error messaging.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be applied:
1. Use the method `is_overlapping()` to check if the intervals are overlapping.
2. Instead of raising `InvalidIndexError`, provide guidance to the user to use `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import statements remain unchanged

# ... (Omitted other related functions)

class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # ... (Omitted other methods)

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "Overlapping indices are detected. Please use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique."
            )
            raise NotImplementedError(msg)

        # The rest of the logic remains unchanged
        # ...

```

In the corrected version, `self.is_overlapping` is called as a method to correctly check if there are overlapping indices. Additionally, the error message has been updated to guide the user with the appropriate action to take.
