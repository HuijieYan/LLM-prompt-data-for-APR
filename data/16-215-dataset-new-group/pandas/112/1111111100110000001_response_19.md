The buggy function is `get_indexer` from the `IntervalIndex` class within the `pandas.core.indexes.interval` module. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the type signature of the function.

The cause of the bug can be due to the incorrect type signature declared for the `get_indexer` function. This error is likely occurring because the method signature does not match the type signature of the function that it is trying to call. This often happens when the method signature is incorrect, or the function being called is handling the inputs improperly.

In order to fix this bug, the correct type signature for the `get_indexer` method needs to be defined. The type signature specified should match the parameters and return type expected by the function being called within the `get_indexer` method.

Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function with the fixed type signature:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # code omitted for brevity
        # ... rest of the code remains unchanged
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version of the `get_indexer` function, the type signature for the parameters and the return type matches the expected types. Additionally, the invocation of the `is_overlapping` method is changed to `self.is_overlapping()` as a method call. This change is made under the assumption that `is_overlapping` is a method rather than a property or attribute.
