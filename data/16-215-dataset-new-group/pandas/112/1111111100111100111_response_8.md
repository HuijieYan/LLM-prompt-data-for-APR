To fix the bug, we need to modify the get_indexer function in the buggy class, IntervalIndex. In the buggy function, there are issues with the comparison of IntervalIndexes and the handling of the elements. The bug appears to be due to incorrect indexing and handling of overlapping indices.

The bug causes a TypeError: No matching signature found when the round method is called on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the get_indexer function to properly handle IntervalIndex comparisons and indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the get_indexer function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if any(self.is_overlapping()):
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        result = np.full(len(target_as_index), -1, dtype='intp')
        for i, t in enumerate(target_as_index):
            for j, s in enumerate(self):
                if t == s:
                    result[i] = j
                    break
    else:
        result = np.full(len(target_as_index), -1, dtype='intp')
        for i, t in enumerate(target_as_index):
            for j, s in enumerate(self):
                if t in s:
                    result[i] = j
                    break

    return ensure_platform_int(result)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles comparisons and indexing of IntervalIndexes. It first checks for overlapping indices and then iterates through the elements to find matching indices.

By updating the logic in the get_indexer function, we ensure that the round method will work as expected when columns are a CategoricalIndex of an IntervalIndex.

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and should resolve the failing test.
