The bug in the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class of pandas is causing a TypeError when attempting to round interval category columns in a data frame.

The possible error locations within the buggy function could be the use of the `get_indexer` method from another class or the incorrect usage of the `IntervalTree` for scalar indices. 

The cause of the bug is a mismatch between the method signature and the actual usage which leads to a TypeError. The signature of the `get_indexer` method does not match the actual call, hence the TypeError: No matching signature found.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the method signature matches its usage when calling the `get_indexer` method. Also, we may have to review the logic within the method to ensure it's handling different scenarios as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
        
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        ...
        # The rest of the logic remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we have included parentheses `()` in the `if` condition `if self.is_overlapping():` to correctly call the `is_overlapping` method. Additionally, the method signature and its usage have been aligned to resolve the TypeError and correct the bug.
