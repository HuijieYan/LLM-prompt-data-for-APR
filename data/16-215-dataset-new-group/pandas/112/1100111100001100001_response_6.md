The cause of the bug in the provided function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the IntervalIndex objects and their attributes, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

Firstly, the buggy code has redundant definition of the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class, causing potential conflicts and errors. The method should only be defined once within the class.

Secondly, the `get_indexer` method is expected to compare overlapping intervals and return the corresponding indices, but it appears to be mishandling the comparison and return values.

To fix the bug, we should remove the redundant definition of the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class and update the logic within the `get_indexer` method to correctly handle the comparison and return values for overlapping intervals.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    else:
        msg = "Target must be an IntervalIndex."
        raise ValueError(msg)
```

It's important to note that the exact fix may require further adjustment based on the specific behavior and requirements of the `IntervalIndex` class and its related functions.
