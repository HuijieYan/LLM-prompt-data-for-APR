The buggy function `get_indexer` is causing issues when the `round` method is applied to a DataFrame with columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The issue has been described on GitHub as "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex," where the `round` method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The expected output is that it should round as normal.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the block of code that handles the case when `is_object_dtype(target_as_index)` is True. This block is deferring elementwise to `get_loc` for heterogeneous scalar index, and it appears to be the root cause of the issue with rounding on CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the block of code that handles heterogeneous scalar index, as it is impacting the rounding method. We need to ensure that the indexer being returned for this case is compatible with the `round` method.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    else:
        # This block is modified to handle heterogeneous scalar index
        # defer elementwise to get_loc for non-overlapping indices
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='intp')
        for i, value in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(value)
                indexer[i] = loc
            except KeyError:
                indexer[i] = -1

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By modifying the block that handles the heterogeneous scalar index, we are ensuring that the `round` method can now work properly with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
