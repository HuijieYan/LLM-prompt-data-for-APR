The buggy function `get_indexer` is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class in the pandas library. The purpose of this method is to retrieve the indexer for a given target index.

There are a couple of potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping` is not calling the method `is_overlapping` to check if the indexes are overlapping.
2. There is a potential issue with how the indexer variable is handled under certain conditions.

The potential cause of the bug is that `self.is_overlapping` is checking if the method exists rather than calling the method to check if the indexes are overlapping. This could result in an unwanted condition being satisfied, leading to incorrect results.

A strategy for fixing the bug in the `get_indexer` function would involve the following steps:
1. Calling the method `is_overlapping` to check if the indexes are overlapping, rather than simply referring to the method name.
2. Ensuring that the logic for generating the indexer array is correctly handled for different types of index targets.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains the same...
```
In the corrected version, the `if self.is_overlapping` condition has been changed to `if self.is_overlapping()` to call the method and check for overlapping indexes. Additionally, the rest of the logic remains the same as per the original implementation.
