Based on the input parameters and the runtime variables, it appears that the bug in the `get_indexer` function is related to the handling of the `target_as_index` variable when it is an instance of `IntervalIndex`.

The bug seems to be occurring in the section where we check for overlapping indices and determine the positional match of indexes. It's possible that the comparison logic for `IntervalIndex` instances is not correctly handling the comparison of the left and right intervals.

Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the return type of the function, as `indexer` is expected to be of type `np.ndarray` but in some cases is being assigned an empty list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic for `IntervalIndex` instances is correctly implemented, and that the return type of the function matches the expected type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                indexer.append(loc)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, I have simplified the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` comparison and accurately returning the indexer as a NumPy array. This should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
