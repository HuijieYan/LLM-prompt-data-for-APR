To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to handle the case where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Based on the error message and the failing test, it seems that the issue is with the mismatch in the signature of the `get_indexer` function. The function signature is expecting a signature that matches the type `scalar_t[:]`, but it is not receiving the correct input.

To fix this bug, we can change the signature of the `get_indexer` function to handle the case when the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. We also need to ensure that the function can handle the different types of inputs appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` by extracting the `IntervalIndex` from the `categories` attribute. Then, we continue with the rest of the logic as before.

With this modification, the `get_indexer` function should now be able to handle the different types of inputs, including the case where the input is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
