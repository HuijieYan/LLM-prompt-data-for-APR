Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function:
1. The function `get_indexer` appears to perform operations based on the `target_as_index` and `self`, but the logic may not be handling the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the `get_indexer` function not handling the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. As a result, when the `round` method is called on such columns, it fails with a TypeError.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This may involve adding specific logic to handle this scenario and ensure that the rounding operation works as expected.

Corrected Version of the Function `get_indexer`:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    # Existing code...

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case when target_as_index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index.categories)  # Use the categories as the target index

    # Existing code...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
In this corrected version, I've added a specific check to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a CategoricalIndex and its categories are of type IntervalIndex. If this condition is met, I extract the categories as the new target index to be used in subsequent operations. This should help resolve the issue with the `round` method failing when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
