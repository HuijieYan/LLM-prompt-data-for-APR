The buggy function is the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class. 

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is likely to be the cause of the bug. It seems to be missing function parentheses, so it's checking if the method `is_overlapping` exists rather than actually calling the method.
2. The line `if self.equals(target_as_index):` is using the `equals` method, but this method is not defined for the `IntervalIndex` class. It should likely be comparing the values directly instead.

Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The buggy function `get_indexer` is intended to compute the indexer for the `IntervalIndex` based on certain conditions and comparisons with the target. However, due to potentially incorrect method calls and comparison approaches, it fails to produce the correct indexer, leading to a failing test.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add parentheses to the `self.is_overlapping` condition so that the method is actually called.
2. Replace the usage of the `equals` method with a direct comparison of values to check if the indexes are equal.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if (self.left == target_as_index.left).all() and (self.right == target_as_index.right).all():
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        ...
```
