The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the handling of `IntervalIndex` objects and their comparison. Based on the runtime values and types provided, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying when the indexes are equal and failing to handle overlapping indices properly.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the condition for handling overlapping indices and ensure that it correctly identifies when indices are overlapping.
2. Verify the comparison of `IntervalIndex` objects and their attributes such as `dtype`, `closed`, `left`, and `right`.
3. Make sure the function handles the scenarios of equal indexes, overlapping but not equal indexes, and non-overlapping indexes correctly.

The corrected version of the `get_indexer` function can be written as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index])
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. The `is_overlapping` method is now correctly called as `self.is_overlapping()`.
2. The comparison of index attributes and values are correctly handled to identify equal, overlapping, and non-overlapping indices.
3. The handling of different scenarios for the input `target` has been improved.

This correction should address the issues identified with the buggy function.
