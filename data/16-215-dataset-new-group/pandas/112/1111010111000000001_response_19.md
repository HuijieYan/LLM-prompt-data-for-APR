The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The test function `test_round_interval_category_columns` fails due to an issue with the `get_indexer` function.

The potential error locations within the `get_indexer` function are:
1. Handling of overlapping indices.
2. Comparison and matching of different types of indexes.
3. Handling of homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.
4. Conversion to platform-specific integer type.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` function is not handling different types of indexes, especially overlapping indices, and the comparison and matching logic is flawed. Additionally, there are issues with handling homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling different types of indexes, including overlapping indices. We also need to ensure that the comparison and matching logic for different index types is correct. Finally, we need to improve the handling of homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes, as well as ensure the conversion to the platform-specific integer type is done correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype, target_as_index.dtype])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_list_like(target_as_index):
        # scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # list-like index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(np.array(indexer, dtype="intp"))
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of different types of indexes, including overlapping indices, and improves the comparison and matching logic. It also provides a more robust handling of homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes. Additionally, it ensures the conversion to the platform-specific integer type is done correctly. This version should pass the failing test.
