To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, we need to address the issue of the `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` causing the `round` method to fail. 

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` function does not handle the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` properly, leading to a failure of the `round` method.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `get_indexer` function to handle the case of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` by implementing the appropriate logic to allow the `round` method to work as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index._src, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index._src
        return self.get_indexer(target_as_index)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for whether the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` and its source is an `IntervalIndex`. If this condition is true, we replace `target_as_index` with its source and recursively call `get_indexer` to handle the case properly.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub and make the `round` method work as expected for `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
