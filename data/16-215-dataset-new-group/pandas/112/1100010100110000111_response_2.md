## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `get_indexer` function in the `interval.py` file is trying to find a signature for a scalar target, but no matching signature is found. This is causing the `round` method to fail when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The code in the `get_indexer` function seems to be checking for different types of indices, including `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`. The specific error message suggests that there is an issue when trying to get the indexer for a scalar target using the `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` call. This indicates that the `self._engine` object does not have a matching signature for a scalar target.

## Bug Cause
The issue is likely caused by the `self._engine` object not handling the case of a scalar target properly, leading to a TypeError when trying to find a matching signature for the scalar target.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to handle the case of a scalar target more robustly, ensuring that the `self._engine` has a matching signature for scalar targets.

## The corrected version

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code for handling IntervalIndex

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        if self._engine is not None and hasattr(self._engine, "get_indexer"):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = self.get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # Remaining code for handling heterogeneous scalar index

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By adding a check to ensure that the `self._engine` attribute is not None and that it has the `get_indexer` method, we can avoid the TypeError caused by missing signatures. This change allows the function to handle scalar targets more effectively and should resolve the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.
