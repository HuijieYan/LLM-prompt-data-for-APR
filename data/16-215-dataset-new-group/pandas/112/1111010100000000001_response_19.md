The buggy function `get_indexer` is located within the class `IntervalIndex`. This function is used to determine the position of elements within the interval index. The error locations within the function are not explicitly specified, but there are several potential problem areas such as the handling of overlapping indices, the comparison of different types of indexes, and the use of the `IntervalTree`.

The cause of the bug is related to the comparison and matching of elements within the interval index, especially when dealing with overlapping indices and different types of indexes.

To fix the bug, it is important to review the logic for handling overlapping indices, ensure proper comparison of different types of indexes, and validate the use of the `IntervalTree` for handling homogeneous scalar indexes. Additionally, error handling and exception handling for heterogeneous scalar indexes should be reviewed to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise NotImplementedError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = ensure_platform_int(
                np.where(self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left) == 
                          self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right), 
                          self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left), -1)
            )

        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
            indexer = ensure_platform_int(indexer)
            
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = [
                self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 
                for key in target_as_index
            ]
            indexer = ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    
        return indexer
```

In the corrected version, the handling of overlapping indices is replaced with a `NotImplementedError` exception. The comparison and matching logic for different types of indexes and the use of `IntervalTree` for homogeneous scalar indexes have been improved. Additionally, error handling and exception handling for heterogeneous scalar indexes have been updated to ensure correct behavior.
