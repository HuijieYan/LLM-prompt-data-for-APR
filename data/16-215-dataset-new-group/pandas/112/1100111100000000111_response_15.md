The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely causing the issue reported in the GitHub bug. The `get_indexer` function is erroring out and this is causing the `round` method to fail when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The root cause of the bug in the `get_indexer` function is that it is not handling the case when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly. This is leading to an error when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with these columns.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `get_indexer` function to handle the case when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, Index):  # Check if target_as_index is an Index
        target_as_index = target_as_index._get_engine_target()  # Handle Index
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)  # Handle other types

    # Rest of the logic remains the same
```

I have added a check to handle the case when `target_as_index` is an Index and then obtain the engine target to handle these cases correctly.

By making these changes, we should be able to resolve the bug and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
