The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is failing the test `test_round_interval_category_columns` with a `TypeError: No matching signature found`. This function takes a few arguments and performs some conditional checks and operations based on the type of the input. The error suggests that the function is not able to find a matching signature when passing `target_as_index.values` to the `_engine.get_indexer` method.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional checks and the operations that follow based on the type of `target_as_index`.

Based on the failing test and the error message, the cause of the bug is the inability to find a matching signature when passing `target_as_index.values` to the `_engine.get_indexer` method. This suggests that there is a mismatch in the type of `target_as_index.values` and the expected signature of the `_engine.get_indexer` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of `target_as_index.values` matches the expected signature of the `_engine.get_indexer` method.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code remains the same
    else:
        # corrected the type for handling non-IntervalIndex input
        target_as_index_values = np.asarray(target_as_index)

        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index_values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the code to handle non-IntervalIndex input by converting `target_as_index` to an array using `np.asarray` to ensure that the type of `target_as_index_values` matches the expected signature of the `_engine.get_indexer` method. This change should address the type mismatch and fix the bug.
