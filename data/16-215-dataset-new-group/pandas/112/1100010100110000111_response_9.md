The error message and the GitHub issue suggest that the bug occurs when the `round` method fails on a DataFrame with columns that are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Looking at the buggy function, potential error locations include: 
1. The usage of `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` which may not be correctly handling the `target_as_index` when it is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method does not handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` correctly, resulting in a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called on the DataFrame with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we should handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` differently, ensuring that the `get_indexer` method can work with this type of index.

Here's a corrected version of the function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> Union[np.ndarray, list]:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # existing logic for IntervalIndex
        pass
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.astype('object').values)
    else:
        # existing logic for other index types
        pass

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By adding a condition to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`, converting it to an object dtype and extracting its values, we can ensure that the `get_indexer` method works correctly in this scenario. This should allow the `round` method to work as expected on a DataFrame with columns that are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
