To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, we need to update the logic to handle the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of `CategoricalIndex` in the method.

Looking at the current implementation of the `get_indexer` function, it's clear that for the case of a `CategoricalIndex`, the logic does not handle it appropriately.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the case when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, such that the `round` method can work properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(
        target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex
    ):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains unchanged
        # ...
    else:
        # rest of the logic remains unchanged
        # ...
```

In this correction, we check if the `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`, and if its `categories` are of type `IntervalIndex`, then we assign `target_as_index` to be the `categories` directly. This will ensure that the subsequent logic correctly handles the `IntervalIndex` when it is wrapped in a `CategoricalIndex`.

Once this correction is made, the `get_indexer` method should handle the case with `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex` properly, and the `round` method should work as expected.

This fix will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the method operates correctly in the presence of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
