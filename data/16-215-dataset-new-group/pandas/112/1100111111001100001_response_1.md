The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely in the conditional logic for different types of indexes. Based on the runtime values and types provided, it seems that the conditional logic for different types of indexes is not handling the cases correctly and is returning incorrect results.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to carefully review the conditional logic and the handling of different types of indexes. It is important to ensure that the correct comparisons and operations are performed for each type of index (e.g., IntervalIndex, scalar index) to generate the correct `indexer` array.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function based on the provided information and the identified bug:

```python
# Assuming the required imports are available

# Other functions and class declarations remain unchanged

@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle cases for IntervalIndex
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    else:
        # Handle cases for other types of indexes
        try:
            indexer = target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
        except KeyError:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional logic is revised to handle cases for different types of indexes, and the `indexer` array is generated based on the correct comparisons and operations for each type of index.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
