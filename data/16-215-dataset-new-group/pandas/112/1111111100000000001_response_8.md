The potential error locations within the provided `get_indexer` function are as follows:
1. The if condition `if self.is_overlapping` seems to be incorrectly checking if `is_overlapping` is a method rather than calling the method to check its result.
2. There is a call to `find_common_type` which could potentially cause issues if there are subtypes that are not compatible.
3. There is a type conversion issue where a scalar index is being attempted to convert to `int` type as well as other index types.
4. The use of `ensure_platform_int` may cause errors if the platform int type is different than expected.

The cause of the bug in the `get_indexer` function is related to the incorrect usage of method calls and handling of different index types.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve the following:
1. Properly call the `is_overlapping` method to get its result and proceed with the logic accordingly.
2. Carefully handle the conversions and type checks for different index types.
3. Verify the usage of `ensure_platform_int` for compatibility with the expected platform int type.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
# ... (other code remains the same)

    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,

        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.

        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])

    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        (other code remains the same...)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index])

    return indexer
