The potential error in the buggy function is likely related to the logic that checks for overlapping indices and the subsequent handling of the target index.

The bug causes the `get_indexer` method to fail when dealing with two DataFrames, one with a regular `IntervalIndex` and the other with a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This error occurs due to the handling of the `target_as_index` variable, which fails to handle the `CategoricalIndex` properly.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic for handling `CategoricalIndex` in the `get_indexer` method.

Here's an updated and corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index._codes

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the fixed version, we explicitly handle the case when the `target_as_index` is of type `CategoricalIndex` by converting it to the underlying codes using `target_as_index._codes`. This modification enables proper handling of `CategoricalIndex` and ensures that the `get_indexer` method behaves as expected.

This correction should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` passes successfully. It also resolves the issue reported in GitHub related to the `round` method failing when columns are `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
