## Analysis
The provided buggy function `get_indexer` is responsible for resolving the index of a target array within an `IntervalIndex` object in pandas. The issue described on GitHub relates to the inability of the `round` method to work when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. Therefore, it is crucial to verify if the `get_indexer` function is causing the issue and correct it accordingly.

## Error Locations
1. The `get_indexer` function might be encountering issues in finding the appropriate index due to the given input.
2. There could be an issue with the handling of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

## Cause of Bug
The bug is likely caused by the `get_indexer` function failing to handle the `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This is leading to incorrect results when the `round` method is employed.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by modifying the `get_indexer` function to properly handle cases where the input is a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. Additionally, adjustments may need to be made to ensure that the function correctly resolves the index for such cases.

## Corrected Version
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # Existing code here...

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Check for CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = IntervalIndex(target_as_index.categories)

    # Existing code here...
```

By identifying the issue, adjusting the function to handle the `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`, and updating the appropriate checks and conversions, the bug can be resolved effectively.
