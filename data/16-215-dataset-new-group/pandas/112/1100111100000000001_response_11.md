Upon analyzing the code provided, it appears that there are two `get_indexer` functions defined in the same class `IntervalIndex` which is causing an issue. The second `get_indexer` function defined in the class is causing the bug as it overrides the previous implementation of the `get_indexer` function.

To resolve this issue, the code should be modified to ensure that only one `get_indexer` function is defined in the `IntervalIndex` class. The duplicate function should be removed to avoid conflicts and potential errors.

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/interval.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(_interval_shared_docs['class'] % dict(klass='IntervalIndex', summary='Immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side.', name=_index_doc_kwargs['name'], versionadded='0.20.0', extra_attributes='is_overlapping\nvalues\n', extra_methods='', examples=textwrap.dedent("    Examples\n    --------\n    A new ``IntervalIndex`` is typically constructed using\n    :func:`interval_range`:\n\n    >>> pd.interval_range(start=0, end=5)\n    IntervalIndex([(0, 1], (1, 2], (2, 3], (3, 4], (4, 5]],\n                  closed='right',\n                  dtype='interval[int64]')\n\n    It may also be constructed using one of the constructor\n    methods: :meth:`IntervalIndex.from_arrays`,\n    :meth:`IntervalIndex.from_breaks`, and :meth:`IntervalIndex.from_tuples`.\n\n    See further examples in the doc strings of ``interval_range`` and the\n    mentioned constructor methods.\n    ")))
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # Existing functions and methods...

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Remaining implementation of the function goes here...
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By removing the duplicate `get_indexer` function, the potential conflict between the multiple functions is resolved. This will ensure that the correct implementation of the function is used when called.
