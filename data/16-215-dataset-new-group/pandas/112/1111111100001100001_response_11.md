The bug in the given function seems to be related to the comparison and indexing of IntervalIndex objects. The function attempts to find the indexer for a given target based on the intervals in the current IntervalIndex.

### Bug Cause
1. The function checks if `self.is_overlapping`, which is likely intended to be a method call (`self.is_overlapping()`), but it is currently used as a property without being invoked.
2. In the case where `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`, the function attempts to compare and find the indexer based on the left and right endpoints of the intervals in both the `self` and `target_as_index`. 
3. The algorithm to find the indexer for non-IntervalIndex targets also seems to have a logic issue, as it handles both homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes but does not return a consistent dtype for the indexer.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that `self.is_overlapping` is actually a method call, if it is intended to be one, and invoke it to obtain the correct value.
2. Evaluate the comparison and indexing logic for `target_as_index` to ensure it correctly identifies matches and non-matches between the intervals.
3. Refactor the logic for non-IntervalIndex targets to consistently handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes and return a consistent dtype for the indexer.

In the corrected version, the issues related to `is_overlapping`, comparison and indexing logic, and inconsistent handling of non-IntervalIndex targets have been addressed. It is important to note that the exact implementation of some functions (such as `_check_method`, `is_overlapping`, etc.) is assumed in the corrected version.
