The cause of the bug in the `get_indexer` function is due to the `_engine.get_indexer` method being called with an inappropriate argument signature. The error message indicates that there is "No matching signature found", suggesting that the argument types passed to `_engine.get_indexer` are not compatible with the expected signature. This is likely leading to a TypeError being raised within the `_engine.get_indexer` method, causing the failure in the `round` method when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix this bug, the signature of the `_engine.get_indexer` method needs to be checked and aligned with the argument types being passed to it. Additionally, the error handling within the `get_indexer` function should also be reviewed to ensure that appropriate checks and conversions are performed before invoking `_engine.get_indexer`.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is fixed to `if self.is_overlapping():` to correctly call the `is_overlapping` method.
2. The call to `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` is replaced with `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)` to align with the corrected signature of the `_engine.get_indexer` method.
3. Error handling is also updated to use a list comprehension for processing a heterogeneous scalar index, ensuring that appropriate checks and conversions are performed before invoking `_engine.get_indexer`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug while also passing the failing test.
