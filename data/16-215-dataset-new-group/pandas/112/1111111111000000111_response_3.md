To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class, we need to address the issue where the `round` method fails when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The issue seems to be related to handling overlapping and non-overlapping intervals in the `get_indexer` function.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error locations within the `get_indexer` function can be identified in the logic for handling non-overlapping indices and the condition for checking if the target is an instance of `IntervalIndex`.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of matching indices in the `get_indexer` function when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This leads to a TypeError when using the `round` method on the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the matching logic for non-overlapping indices is correctly implemented and that the condition for checking if the target is an instance of `IntervalIndex` is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(-1, len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index])
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the `is_overlapping` function is called as a method using `self.is_overlapping()`. Additionally, the method `left()`, `right()`, and `_engine()` are called as methods with parentheses. The logic for handling non-overlapping indices is also refined, and the matching condition for non-overlapping indices and handling heterogeneous scalar indices is fixed.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the `round` method works as expected when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
