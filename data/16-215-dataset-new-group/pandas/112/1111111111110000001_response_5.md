The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class which is a method derived from the `pandas.core.indexes.interval` file. The failing test is testing the `round` method on a DataFrame, and it fails because an error is raised within the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class.

The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` and it is originating from the `_engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` method call within the `get_indexer` function.

The likely cause of this bug is that there is no specific signature available in the `get_indexer` method for the input type provided (which is a scalar). This suggests a potential issue with the type validation or handling within the `get_indexer` method, possibly related to the `_engine` method, and may also be due to an incompatibility in the input type being provided to the `get_indexer` method.

A strategy for fixing this bug would start by reviewing the input types and their corresponding handling within the `get_indexer` method, ensuring that the method is appropriately accepting and processing the given scalar input. Additionally, it may be necessary to further investigate the `_engine` method and its relationship to the `get_indexer` method to ensure they are aligned with each other.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the logic remains the same
        # ...
    elif is_scalar(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = ensure_index([target_as_index])  # ensure scalar is turned into an Index
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(target_as_index)])
    else:
        # rest of the logic remains the same for handling non-interval index

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The corrected version includes a condition to appropriately handle the case of a scalar input in the `get_indexer` method, ensuring it is converted into an Index type before further processing. This should resolve the `TypeError: No matching signature found` issue and allow the failing test to pass.
