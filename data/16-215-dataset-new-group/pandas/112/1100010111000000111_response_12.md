After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue arises from the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The `get_indexer` function is used to get the indices of the intervals in the index, which is crucial for various operations involving interval data.

The cause of the bug is related to the `get_indexer` function not handling the case where the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, which leads to a failure in the `round` method when applied to a DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to modify the `get_indexer` function to properly handle `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check within the function to accommodate the specific case of `CategoricalIndex` as per the GitHub issue description and then ensuring that the `get_indexer` function provides the correct indices for such columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        return target_as_index.codes
    # ... existing code for other cases ...
    else:
        # existing code for handling other index types
        ...
```
In this corrected version, an additional conditional check has been added to handle the case where the `CategoricalIndex` is created from an `IntervalIndex`. In this case, the function directly returns the `codes` attribute of the `CategoricalIndex`, as it represents the indices of the intervals.

With this correction, the `get_indexer` function should now be able to properly handle the `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex`, and the `round` method should no longer fail when applied to such columns, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
