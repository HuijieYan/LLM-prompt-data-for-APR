The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. When accessing a series using the syntax `ser[key]`, where `key` is a list, the behavior is inconsistent with accessing it using `ser[np.array(key)]` or `ser[pd.Index(key)]`. This inconsistency also affects how `ser.loc[key]` behaves for the different types of indexers.

The reason for this bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle the list indexers properly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access a non-existent element.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with that of array-like indexers and handle them properly in the `_get_with` function.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:  # The default behavior should be to use loc
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we handle list indexers separately and ensure that the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers. We also handle the case where the key type is "mixed-integer" to accommodate situations where the indexer contains a mix of integer and non-integer values.

With this corrected function, the test cases should now pass without raising a `KeyError`, and the behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers.
