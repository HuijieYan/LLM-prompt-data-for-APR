The bug is in the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, where it is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, causing a KeyError to be raised when accessing the Series with a list key. 

The bug occurs because the code does not treat list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError being raised when accessing the Series with a list key. The issue on GitHub indicates that this behavior is unexpected and inconsistent.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError and make the behavior consistent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all other cases
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the condition to handle list-like keys, the function now properly handles the case of a list key and should fix the KeyError issue. This corrected version aligns the behavior for list indexers with other array-like indexers, making the behavior consistent and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
