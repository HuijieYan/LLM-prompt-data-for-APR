The bug lies in the handling of different indexers in the `_get_with` function. The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers.

The bug appears to be caused by the inconsistent behavior between list indexers and other indexers, leading to incorrect handling and resulting in errors when accessing the data. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles list indexers consistently with other indexers, such as array-like indexers. This consistency should prevent errors when accessing the data and should align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that for all types of indexers (list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index), the function uses `self.loc[key]` to access the data. For other types of key, it falls back to using `self.reindex(key)`. This consistency aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug.
