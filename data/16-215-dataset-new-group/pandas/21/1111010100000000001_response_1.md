The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a series. However, there are several potential error locations in the function that could cause the bug, including the if-elif-elif block structure that doesn't allow for proper type checking and handling of different key types.

The buggy function is causing issues when attempting to index a `Series` with a `DataFrame`, it raises a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the key types need to be handled differently and the type checking needs to be improved. Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        loc = self.index._should_fallback_to_positional()
        return self.iloc[key] if loc else self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle slice and tuple types first, followed by handling scalar keys using `is_scalar` and `is_bool` checks. Then, we handle lists separately for better type checking. Finally, any other key types are handled by reindexing.

This approach provides better type handling and improves readability of the function, addressing the potential errors and fixing the bug.
