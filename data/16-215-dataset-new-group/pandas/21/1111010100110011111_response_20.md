## The potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The checks for isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame), isinstance(key, tuple), and not is_list_like(key) could lead to issues if the type of key is not correctly identified.
2. The if statements checking key_type and the subsequent decision-making based on key_type might lead to incorrect output.
3. The handling of different types of key (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index) might be inaccurate.


## Cause of the bug:

The bug is likely caused by inconsistencies in the handling of different types of indexers (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series). The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior of the function with list-based indexers is different from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency is causing failed tests and unexpected behavior when retrieving values from the Series.


## Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the function handles different types of indexers uniformly.
2. Correctly identify the type of the key and handle it appropriately, ensuring that the correct method of accessing values from the Series is used.
3. Verify if the key exists in the index, and if not, raise a KeyError to maintain consistency across different types of indexers.
4. Make necessary changes to align the function's behavior with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.


## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        if len(key) == 0 or not key.isin(self.index).any():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the key is converted to an Index using `ensure_index`. Then we check if any of the keys are not in the Series index. If so, we raise a KeyError to maintain consistency with the disallowed case, as requested in the GitHub issue. This approach should fix the bug and provide the expected behavior for the function.
