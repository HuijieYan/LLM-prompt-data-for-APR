The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be caused by the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series using different types of indexers. The function is not handling the case of a list indexer properly, and this inconsistency is also reported in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The bug occurs when the `_get_with` function is called with a list-like key parameter, as in the failing test cases provided. When indexing a Series with a list key, the function should handle the key differently, but it is not doing so. This results in a KeyError being raised when it should not.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the list indexer case consistently with other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers. This will also resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # handle list-like keys consistently

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now checks for list-like keys specifically and handles them consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring that the KeyError is not raised when indexing a Series with a list key. This also aligns with the expected behavior as provided in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
