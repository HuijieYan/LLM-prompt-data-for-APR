The bug occurs in the _get_with function, where the key is checked for various types and then indexed based on those types. The bug seems to be due to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers versus array-like indexers. The GitHub issue indicates that there is a difference in behavior when using a list key to index a Series compared to array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the behavior of list indexers needs to be made consistent with array-like indexers. This may involve modifying the logic for handling list keys in the _get_with function.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Modify the logic for handling list indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handle non-list-like keys
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling list indexers has been modified to ensure consistent behavior with array-like indexers. The key is checked for list-like nature first, and then the appropriate indexing method is applied based on the type of the key. This should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
