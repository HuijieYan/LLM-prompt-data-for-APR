The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of list-like indexers. The current implementation of the function handles different types of indexers in a non-uniform manner, leading to inconsistency in behavior and erroneous results.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to index with a list. This inconsistency in behavior has been reported as a GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently and ensure that it does not raise a `KeyError` when attempting to index with a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or ndarray is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now handles list-like indexers consistently and returns the appropriate values without raising a `KeyError`. This fix ensures that the function behaves uniformly for different types of indexers, addressing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
