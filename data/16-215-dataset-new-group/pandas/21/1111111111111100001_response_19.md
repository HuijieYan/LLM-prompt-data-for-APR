The issue seems to be that when calling the `_get_with` function on the Series object, the code is not correctly handling the different data types of the `key` parameter. It seems like there is an issue with the logic used to determine the type of the `key` variable, leading to incorrect handling and causing the test to fail with a KeyError.

To resolve this issue, the logic in the `_get_with` function needs to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. It should also correctly handle the cases where the key is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
```

This updated function handles the different types of `key` input correctly, ensures it is converted to an index type, and correctly handles the cases where the key is not found in the index.

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function as shown above, the failing test cases should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle the different types of input keys.
