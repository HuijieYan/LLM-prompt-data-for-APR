In the buggy function `_get_with`, there are several potential error locations. One is the handling of non-list-like keys and the conversion of keys to a list, as well as the usage of the `reindex` method.

The cause of the bug is the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers with the `ser` Series. The failing test is being triggered by the inconsistency between the behavior of `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]`, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure consistent behavior between different types of indexers when accessing the Series. This may involve modifying the behavior of the `reindex` method and handling non-list-like keys in a more consistent manner.

Given the explanations and analysis, here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "mixed"):
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

This corrected version ensures that non-list-like keys are converted to a list before further processing, and handles key types consistently, including mixed types where appropriate. This should resolve the inconsistency and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
