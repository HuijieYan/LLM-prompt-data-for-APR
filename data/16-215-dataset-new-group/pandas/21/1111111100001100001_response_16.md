The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the type of the `key` is being determined. The function incorrectly infers the type of the `key` variable, resulting in the wrong path being taken based on this inference.

Given the nature of the cases and their runtime values:
- The `key` is treated as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, but not being correctly inferred.
- The `self.index` is a RangeIndex with start=0 and stop=2.
- The `self` is a Series with values 'A' and 'B'.

The buggy function should correctly infer the type of the key and appropriately handle the different cases of input.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to correctly infer the type of the `key` input and handle each type appropriately according to the inferred type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (str, np.str)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for specific types (slice, DataFrame, tuple, int, str, list) and handles each type appropriately. The use of `isinstance` helps to accurately handle each case based on the type of the `key`.
