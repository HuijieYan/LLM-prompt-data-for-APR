The bug seems to be in the logic used to determine the type of the `key` when it enters the `_get_with` function.

The bug arises because the logic to check the type of `key` is inconsistent, and it incorrectly infers the data type of the key. As a result, the incorrect logic leads to improper handling of the key type, which causes the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the key type should be replaced with more accurate type checking and handling.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # If the key is not a scalar, treat it as a list of labels
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected version includes more robust type checking and utilizes built-in pandas functions like `is_scalar`, `ensure_index`, and `is_list_like` to handle different types of input keys appropriately. It should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
