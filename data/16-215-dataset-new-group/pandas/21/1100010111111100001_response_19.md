The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be caused by the incorrect identification of the type of the `key` variable. The function fails to handle the case where `key` is a list or an ndarray. It wrongly classifies the key type as a string, which then leads to an error when attempting to perform the indexing operation.

To fix this issue, we need to properly identify the type of the `key` variable and handle the cases where the key is a list or an ndarray.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, pd.Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles different types of `key` inputs and should pass the failing test.
