The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it is treating the input `key` as a list-like object, regardless of its type. This causes an issue when trying to index the `Series` with `key`, resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic to handle different types of `key` appropriately, and use the correct method for indexing the `Series`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we use `is_scalar(key)` to check if the `key` is a scalar value. If it is, we check if it's present in the index using `key not in self.index`, and if not, raise a `KeyError`. For non-scalar `key`, we use `self.loc[key]` to index the `Series`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and return the expected output for the given input.
