The given buggy function `_get_with` is an internal function that is being called when a specific operation is performed. The function contains an extensive selection of conditional blocks to determine how a key should be interpreted and used to access data within the Series. The function returns a key error when the key provided is not found in the index.

The failing test tries to determine if an exactly matching item can be found using different types of index data structures.

The possible cause for the failure could be linked to the conditional blocks within the `_get_with` function failing to resolve how to handle and interpret the index when the key provided does not exist within it. this may be leading to a key error being raised when the intention is to rather return a value that is recognizable. This observation is based on the intention of the test case and its expected behavior.

To solve this bug, the function `_get_with` should be reworked such that it iteratively attempts to find the index via multiple conditional checks before giving up and raising a `KeyError`. This strategy will ensure that an appropriate type of index is selected and the key error is raised only when it is necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        raise ValueError("Key not found in the index")
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
