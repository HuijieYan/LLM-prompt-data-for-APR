The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)` from the pandas core series, and it handles different types of indexers to retrieve values from the series. The function identifies the type of key passed to it and acts accordingly to obtain the values from the series. Cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 are different scenarios for the input `key` and how the function handles them.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly identifies the `key` type in some cases, leading to the wrong behavior. It should recognize the type of `key` and select the appropriate method to retrieve the values from the series. The desired outcome is that the function should correctly identify the type of key and execute the appropriate method to retrieve the values.

Based on the GitHub issue, this bug is related to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The issue mentions that there is inconsistency in how list indexers, array-like indexers, and Index indexers are treated, leading to unexpected behavior in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly identify the type of `key` passed to it and handle it consistently for different types of indexers. The function should ensure that the behavior is consistent and that the retrieval of values from the series works as expected for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, slice)):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function checks for the type of `key` and handles it appropriately. If the `key` is a tuple or slice, it calls the `_slice` method to retrieve the values. If the `key` is a DataFrame, it raises a TypeError. For list-like, array-like, or Index types, it uses the `loc` method to retrieve the values. For any other type of `key`, it uses the `reindex` method. This ensures consistent and correct behavior for different types of indexers.
