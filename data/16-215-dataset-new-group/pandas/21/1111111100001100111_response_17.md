The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing unexpected behavior when indexing a Series using a list key. It treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError in some cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError when using a list key to index a Series.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers, ensuring that it does not raise a KeyError when using a list key to index a Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers by using `self.loc[key]` for both cases, ensuring that the function does not raise a KeyError when using a list key to index a Series. This change aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue identified in the GitHub report.
