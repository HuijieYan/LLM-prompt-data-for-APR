The issue in the buggy function occurs when trying to index the Series with a list-like object. This causes inconsistent behavior, leading to a KeyError when using a list as the index. The function fails to handle this case properly and does not return the expected result, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we should modify the _get_with function to handle list-like indexers in the same way as array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Convert key to a list
        key = list(key)
        
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other index types
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version properly handles list-like indexers and ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

After implementing this fix, running the failing test should now pass, and the function should return the expected results.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue by ensuring consistent behavior for indexing Series with list-like objects, array-like objects, and other index types. It resolves the inconsistency and provides the expected behavior for the indexing operation.
