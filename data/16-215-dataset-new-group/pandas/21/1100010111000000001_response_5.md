The buggy function `_get_with` appears to be handling different types of indexers to access Series data. It seems to be trying to differentiate between positional and label-based indexing and convert the key to the appropriate format for slicing. However, it is encountering issues with different types of keys, such as a tuple, single value, list, or DataFrame.

At the end of the function, it attempts to reindex the Series using the input key, which is likely where the bug is located.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to access a Series using a key that does not exist in the index, and it expects a `KeyError` to be raised.

The bug in the function may be related to improperly handling the conversion and interpretation of the key types.

To fix the bug, we should focus on ensuring that the key is correctly handled for reindexing and that a KeyError is raised if the key does not exist in the Series index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Handled scalar key by using `is_scalar` and `loc`.
2. Converted key to an index using `ensure_index`.
3. Handled integer key by using `is_integer`, and `loc` or `iloc` to access the data.
4. Handled list-like key by using `is_list_like` and `loc`.
5. Raised a KeyError if the key is not found.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
