The issue appears to be related to the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `Series` class. The `__getitem__` method for list indexers is raising a `KeyError`, while it does not for array-like indexers. The objective is to make all these cases behave consistently, preferably like the list case. 

The bug in the `_get_with` function may be causing this inconsistency. The key_type is being inferred as 'string' for all types of keys, which does not match the behavior observed for list indexers.

One strategy to fix the bug is to modify the logic for inferring the key_type based on the type of key being passed. If the key is a list or an array-like indexer, the key_type should be inferred as 'list', and if it's an Index or integer, the key_type should be inferred accordingly. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = None
    if is_list_like(key):
        key_type = 'list'
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        key_type = 'integer'
    elif lib.is_bool_indexer(key) or is_bool(key):
        key_type = 'boolean'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type is not None and key_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "list":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the key_type is inferred based on the type of the key being passed, as well as the Index and integer cases are handled separately. This should help ensure that the behavior for list indexers and array-like indexers is consistent, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
