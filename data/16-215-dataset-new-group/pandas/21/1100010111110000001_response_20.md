The provided function `_get_with` is faulty due to the incorrect implementation of handling different key types and the resulting inability to properly index the Series object with certain key types. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` exemplifies the failure due to the bug in the `_get_with` function, manifesting in a `KeyError` not being raised.

The cause of the issue is the faulty handling of the `key` parameter when it is passed to the `ser` Series object using subscription-based indexing. The incorrect implementations within the `_get_with` function for different `key` types lead to the Series object not being indexed correctly, causing the test function to fail and the `KeyError` not being raised.

To rectify this bug, it is necessary to refactor the `_get_with` function to handle different `key` types properly for indexing the Series object. Additionally, proper validation and behavior when indexing with non-existent keys should be implemented to ensure that a `KeyError` is correctly raised.

The refactored and corrected version of the `_get_with` function should look as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    # Check if the key is not found in the index
    if not self.index.isin(key).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The refactored version includes additional validation to check if the `key` is not found in the index and raises a `KeyError` with a meaningful error message in such cases._FIX_
