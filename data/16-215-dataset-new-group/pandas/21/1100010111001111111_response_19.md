The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, particularly when the index is a list. The function is not handling the list index correctly, leading to a KeyError in specific cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the function handles list indexers and ensure that it behaves consistently with other types of indexers. We should also address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue related to the behavior of `ser.loc[key]`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have ensured that list indexers are handled consistently, and we have also addressed the inconsistency related to `ser.loc[key]` behavior.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
