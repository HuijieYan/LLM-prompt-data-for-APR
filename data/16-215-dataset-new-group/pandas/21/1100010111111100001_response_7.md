Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug in the function is caused by incorrectly inferring the key_type as "string" in multiple cases. Additionally, the condition checks for the key type at the beginning of the function are not properly handling certain input types, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, we can reassess the condition checks for different key types and handle each case appropriately. Additionally, we should ensure that the key_type is accurately inferred based on the input key.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported; use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # Infer the key type
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional condition checks for different key types, including handling cases where the key type is inferred as "string" and "integer". This should resolve the issues with key inference and the inappropriate handling of key types, allowing the function to pass the failing tests.
