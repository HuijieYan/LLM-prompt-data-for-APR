The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of the `key` parameter. The function is designed to handle different types of keys and route the index lookup appropriately based on the type of the key. However, there are multiple issues with this handling that result in the failing test. Specifically, it is failing when `box` is set to a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function to ensure that the index lookup is performed correctly based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.is_type_compatible(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")

    # Fall back to reindex if above checks failed
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling different types of keys has been improved to handle list, numpy array, Index, Series, and other types of keys correctly. The last conditional statement now checks for compatibility using `self.index.is_type_compatible(key)` and ensures correct error handling.
