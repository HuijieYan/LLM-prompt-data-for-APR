The buggy function is failing to handle the case when `key_type` is not properly determined. This is causing the function to raise a KeyError error, which is not expected.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined and handled in the function. We can do this by checking if `key_type` is one of the expected types before using it in conditional blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle other cases
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif is_integer(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly determine the type of `key` and handle it accordingly, leading to the expected behavior when used in the failing test cases.

The corrected function now properly handles the different cases of the input `key` and should pass all the failing test cases provided.
