The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how the function handles different types of input for the `key` parameter. Based on the failing test, it appears that the function is unable to handle certain types of input, leading to a KeyError.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not properly distinguishing between different types of input for the `key` parameter, specifically when it comes to handling values that are not present in the index of the Series.

To fix this bug, you could modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that it correctly handles different types of input for the `key` parameter and handles the case where the key does not exist in the Series index.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Check if any of the keys are not present in the index
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"Some of the keys {key} are not in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    elif hasattr(key, '__iter__'):
        # Check if key is an iterable but not a list
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with non-list iterables is not supported")
    else:
        # Handle other types of keys
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"The key {key} is not in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional checks to handle different types of input for the `key` parameter and ensures that it properly handles the case where the key does not exist in the Series index.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle different types of input for the `key` parameter.
