To fix the bug, we need to address the issue with the handling of list indexers differently from other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The bug occurs when using a list indexer, resulting in a KeyError.

Based on the information provided, we will make the necessary amendments to ensure that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert to Index type
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By using `ensure_index(key)` to convert all indexers to the Index type, we ensure that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers. This will address the KeyError issue and align the behavior with the expectations for the failing test cases.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle all types of indexers consistently, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values provided.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue originally reported on GitHub.
