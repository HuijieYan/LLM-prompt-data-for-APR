The bug in the function seems to be related to the incorrect determination of the `key_type` variable. The current implementation checks the type of the `key` variable and then attempts to infer its type using the `lib.infer_dtype` function. However, the logic to determine the `key_type` does not seem to be handling the different types of `key` correctly, resulting in the incorrect determination of the `key_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `key_type` is correctly determined based on the type of the `key` variable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `key_type` is determined after ensuring that the `key` variable is handled correctly, covering the different types of possible inputs. This should ensure that the `key_type` is appropriately determined for the subsequent logic in the function.
