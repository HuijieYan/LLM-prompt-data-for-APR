The buggy function has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The function includes an 'elif' statement to check if the key is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, which is not necessary and can cause a potential issue.
2. The function incorrectly handles the `key` variable in the last 'if' statement, where it checks if the `key` is an instance of `Index`. This logic is incorrect and may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made to the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, I removed the unnecessary 'elif' statement for checking if the key is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`. Additionally, I removed the incorrect logic for checking if the `key` is an instance of `Index`, and instead directly used `lib.infer_dtype` to determine the key_type.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys and return the expected output based on the input parameters.
