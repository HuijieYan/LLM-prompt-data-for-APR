The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it doesn't handle the case when a list-like key is used to access the Series, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like indexers such as ndarray or Index. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list as a key to access the Series, while other types of indexers do not raise an error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all array-like indexers, including lists. In this case, we need to handle the list-like key the same way as we handle other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/series.py

def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now handles the case of a list-like key by converting it to a list if it's not list-like initially. This ensures consistent behavior for all array-like indexers and resolves the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
