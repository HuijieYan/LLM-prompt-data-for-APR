The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the use of the `self.index._convert_slice_indexer` method, which is not a defined method in the `Series` class. This method is also not available in any parent classes.

The error message shows that the function `ser[key]` is expected to raise a `KeyError`, but it does not. This suggests that key lookup is not working properly when `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key index lookup is handled correctly. If `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, it should raise a `KeyError` if none of its values are present in the index of the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # There's no need to check for the type of key; it includes all types such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series
    result = self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(result, Series):
        # If the result is not a Series, it means the key did not exist in the index
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    return result
```

By using the `self.loc[key]` method, we are ensuring that the lookup behaves as expected, and if any key in the list is not found in the index, a `KeyError` will be raised. This should resolve the issue seen in the failing test cases.
