1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the pandas library. It is designed to handle indexing operations on a Series object, accepting different types of indexers such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others. The error messages from the failing test indicate that there is inconsistency in the behavior of the `_get_with` function when using list-like indexers, which results in a KeyError.

2. The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are in the conditional blocks that handle different types of indexers, especially the `if not is_list_like(key)` block and the subsequent logic for dealing with list indexers.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like indexers correctly. The failing test is specifically designed to demonstrate the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other indexers. The corresponding error messages clearly indicate that the KeyError is raised when using a list indexer, which is not the expected behavior. The GitHub issue further highlights the inconsistency and raises the question of whether there is a compelling reason for this behavior.

4. To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers, similar to the behavior of other indexers such as slice, DataFrame, and tuple. This may involve analyzing the conditional blocks and the handling of list-like indexers to align with the expected behavior and address the inconsistency reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the conditional block for list-like indexers has been modified to ensure proper handling of list indexers and to align with the expected behavior. The logic for handling different types of indexers has been updated to achieve consistency and address the reported inconsistency in behavior.
