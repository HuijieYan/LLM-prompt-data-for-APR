To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the handling of indexers for Series, particularly with the `list` case outlined in the GitHub issue. The issue presents the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers and calls for a compelling reason for this behavior.

Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, it seems that the implementation is causing inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers. The difference in behavior when using `ser[list(key)]` compared to other types of indexers is leading to the KeyError, highlighting the inconsistency.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional blocks in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior irrespective of the type of indexers being used. Specifically, we should update the block related to `is_list_like` and how it handles the key. By treating the list case similarly to other indexers, we can maintain consistency in behavior and address the reported issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Updated conditional block to handle list-like key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Updated conditional block to handle list-like key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated version, we have modified the conditional blocks to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers, addressing the reported inconsistency and key error issue.

By making these changes, the function should now provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
