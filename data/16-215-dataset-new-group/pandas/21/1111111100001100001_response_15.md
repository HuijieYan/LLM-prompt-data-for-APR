The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the `key_type` variable not being correctly determined. The `key_type` is calculated based on the data type of the `key` variable, and certain conditions that should override or reassign the `key_type` are not being properly evaluated.

The bug seems to be related to how the function is determining the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` input parameter. It appears that the logic for determining the `key_type` is not covering all the necessary cases, leading to incorrect behavior when processing the input.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` should be revised to cover all possible input types and conditions, ensuring that the correct type is inferred for the `key`. This could involve adding additional checks and conditions to properly handle different input types.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Updated calculation of key_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is recalculated based on the inferred data type of the `key` using the `lib.infer_dtype` function. This should provide a more accurate determination of the `key_type` and prevent incorrect behavior in the function.
