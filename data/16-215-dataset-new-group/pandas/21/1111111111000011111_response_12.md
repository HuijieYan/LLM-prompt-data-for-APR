The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle certain cases, as specified in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`. When a key is passed to the function, it fails to properly determine the `key_type` and handle it accordingly. As a result, it leads to inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers.

The function `_get_with` should be adjusted to correctly handle the different types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior across all cases.

Based on the analysis, the bug can be fixed by modifying the key handling logic and the determination of the `key_type` in the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for key")

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in index")

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check for unsupported types of keys such as `slice` and `ABCDataFrame` and raise a `TypeError` if encountered.
- We then handle the case for tuple type keys by calling the `_get_values_tuple` function.
- Next, we check if the key is a scalar and not found in the index, in which case we raise a `KeyError`.
- Finally, if it's a list-like key, we ensure it is converted to an index using the `ensure_index` method and then call `reindex` with the key.

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of different types of keys and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
