The error messages provide information regarding a failure to raise a `KeyError` when trying to access a series with an invalid key. This may indicate an issue with the `_get_with` function, which is responsible for indexing the series.

Looking at the `_get_with` function, it seems that the `key` parameter is processed with a set of conditionals, which could lead to incorrect indexing and potential bugs.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the key is processed correctly in every condition and that the indexing method is appropriate based on the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_dict_like(key):  # Added is_dict_like to handle Series as a key
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, dict)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The changes include adding a condition to handle `dict` keys, ensuring that `is_dict_like` is imported. Additionally, some modifications of the conditional block to handle key processing have been made.

This corrected version should address the issues raised in the failing test cases and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.
