## The buggy function

The given function `_get_with` is aimed at handling different types of key inputs and returning corresponding values from the series `self`. However, it is failing to handle the inputs properly, as evidenced by the provided error messages and runtime input/output values.

## Bug analysis

1. In case 1, 2, and 3, the variable `key_type` is being inferred as `'string'`, which is incorrect. It should be inferred as `'object'` in these cases.

2. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a KeyError being raised, which means that the key provided is not being found in the index of the series.

3. The function should correctly infer the type of the key and determine whether it should use positional or label-based indexing to retrieve the value from the series.

## Bug fix strategy

To fix the bug, the function should accurately determine the type of the key input and then perform the appropriate type of indexing to retrieve the values from the series. Additionally, the indexing should consider whether the key exists in the index of the series and handle it accordingly to avoid raising a KeyError.

## The corrected function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "object":
        if not self.index.isin(key).any():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

In the corrected function, the key type is inferred accurately, and it is checked whether the key exists in the index. If the key is of type 'object', it is validated against the index, and a KeyError is raised if it doesn't exist. Otherwise, the function uses positional indexing with `iloc`.

These corrections will ensure that the function handles different types of key inputs properly and retrieves the values from the series without raising a KeyError.
