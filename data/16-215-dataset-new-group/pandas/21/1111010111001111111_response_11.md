The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` operation. The failing test case specifically involves a `list` indexer, which results in a `KeyError` with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other array-like indexers, and it also differs from the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` for all cases.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the `key_type` variable is assigned the value `'string'` when it should potentially be assigned a different type based on the type of the `key` input parameter. This discrepancy in determining the `key_type` may be causing the faulty behavior when handling the list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the `key` parameter is correctly identified and handled to avoid the `KeyError` for list indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version contains the modified logic to properly handle the type of the `key` parameter, correctly identifying "integer" type for positional indexers and handling other types as required.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, thus resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
