The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in the treatment of different types of indexers. The issue on GitHub highlights that the behavior of `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]` is inconsistent, with the latter causing a KeyError. The expected behavior is for all cases to behave like the list case, where no KeyError is raised.

The key problem in the `_get_with` function is the handling of list indexers. It is incorrectly treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to the KeyError when using a list as the key.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to ensure that list indexers are treated the same as other array-like indexers, preventing the KeyError from being raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now properly handles list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring that the KeyError is not raised, consistent with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
