Based on the analysis of the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears that the issue arises from the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The key_type variable is determined based on the type of the key used for indexing. It seems that there is an issue with the type inference or handling of list-like keys, which causes the inconsistent behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the key_type variable should be correctly inferred based on the type of the key being used for indexing. Additionally, the handling of list-like keys should be made consistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_list_like(key):
            key_type = 'list'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type in ("integer", "list"):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type variable is inferred based on the type of the key being used for indexing. If the key is list-like, the key_type is set to 'list', and the handling of list-like keys is made consistent with other array-like indexers. This should resolve the inconsistencies observed in the GitHub issue.
