In the provided buggy function, the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file, there are various potential error locations:
1. The `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition may not correctly handle the case when `key` is a single value, instead of a list, array, or series.
2. The code for handling the `integer` key type and deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing may not be functioning as expected.
3. The logic for handling different types of keys and their inference may have issues.

The GitHub issue suggests that there is inconsistency in the behavior of indexing when using a list indexer compared to array-like indexers. It's mentioned that the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` raises for all cases, indicating that there might be a bug in the handling of different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and address the specific issue identified in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Always use label-based indexing
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the following changes have been made:
1. Added a check for scalar key using `is_scalar` function. If the key is scalar, it directly performs label-based indexing using `self.loc[key]`.
2. Used `ensure_index` to ensure that the key is converted into an Index, which helps in handling consistency across different types of indexers.
3. Removed the condition for handling `list` separately as it is now being handled using `ensure_index` and `lib.infer_dtype` for inference of the key type.

These changes aim to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the behavior is consistent across various cases.
