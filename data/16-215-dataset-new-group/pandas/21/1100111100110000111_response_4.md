The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated in the Series function. As per the issue reported in GitHub, list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, which is causing inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to treat all indexers uniformly, irrespective of their type (list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series).

Here's the corrected version of the function that will resolve the issue:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        if len(key) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Item wrong length with boolean indexer")
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index` and checking for `is_bool` before reindexing, we can ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, as proposed in the issue on GitHub. This corrected function should resolve the inconsistency and pass the failing test case.
