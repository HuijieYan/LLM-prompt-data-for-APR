The bug appears to be in the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The failing tests are due to the fact that the function does not perform as expected with different types of input key (list, np.array, Index, Series).

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` logic for handling input types like list, np.array, Index, and Series is not functioning as expected, causing the KeyError to be raised during the test. The `_get_with` function should properly handle different input types and prevent the KeyError from being raised.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different types of input keys should be revised to ensure the function can handle list, np.array, Index, and Series types properly.

Here's the corrected `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass without raising a KeyError.
