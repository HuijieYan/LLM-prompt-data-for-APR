The buggy code is in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function contains logic to handle different types of indexers, but it has an issue with list-like indexers that results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the code treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and unexpected KeyError when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is aligned. This can be done by updating the logic to handle list indexers in a manner consistent with how it handles other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This updated function treats list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

Further testing with the provided failing test cases and additional test cases should be performed to ensure that the updated function works correctly and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
