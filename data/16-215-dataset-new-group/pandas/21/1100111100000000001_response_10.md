Here are the steps to fix the buggy function:

1. Analyze the function and its relationship with related functions:
   The _get_with function is part of the Series class in the pandas.core.series module. It calls other functions like _slice, _get_values_tuple, and reindex, which are also part of the Series class.

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
   The potential error locations in the buggy function include the handling of different types of key inputs and the decision to either use positional or label-based indexing based on the key type.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function and the related functions:
   The bug occurs because the function does not handle different types of key inputs correctly and does not make a clear decision between positional and label-based indexing.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
   The bug can be fixed by improving the logic for handling different types of key inputs and making a clear decision between positional and label-based indexing based on the key type.

5. Given the buggy function below, provide a corrected version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check for scalar keys using the is_scalar function. Also, I have removed the redundant check for list-like keys and consolidated the decision-making process for handling different key types. Additionally, I have incorporated the logic for handling positional and label-based indexing based on the key type.
