To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates that using a list indexer raises a `KeyError` for cases where other array-like indexers do not. 

The issue arises because the function does not handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. This inconsistency causes the `KeyError` to be raised when using a list indexer, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, we will modify the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and other array-like indexers, preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers by checking if the key is array-like before performing the indexing. This change ensures that both list and other array-like indexers are processed in a consistent manner, resolving the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing test.
