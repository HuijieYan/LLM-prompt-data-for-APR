The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the conditional statements not properly handling the input types. It fails when the input `key` is a list, array, or Index object because it cannot find the corresponding value in the Series index. This causes a KeyError to be raised even if the value exists in the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the different types of inputs and retrieves the corresponding values from the Series index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # Convert key to list if it's not list-like
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]

        # Convert key to list
        key = list(key)

        # Reindex the Series with the key
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This version of the function handles different input types, converts the input to a list if necessary, and then reindexes the Series with the key. This should resolve the KeyError issue and make the function work as expected in all cases.
