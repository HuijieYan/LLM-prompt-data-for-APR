The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue. The problem seems to arise from how indexers are treated differently, specifically when a list indexer is used, resulting in unexpected behavior and inconsistencies between different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the treatment of list indexers in the `_get_with` function, which leads to inconsistencies in behavior. This is likely impacting the behavior of the function when dealing with different types of indexers, causing the unexpected results and inconsistencies reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the treatment of list indexers should be revised to match the behavior of other indexers, such as array-like indexers. This may involve modifying the conditional statements related to list-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the treatment of list indexers has been modified to match the behavior of other indexers, ensuring consistent handling across different types of indexers. This should resolve the reported inconsistencies and fulfill the expected input/output values, as well as address the issue reported on GitHub.
