It appears that the buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to index the Series.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when the key is list-like. This is inconsistent with how it handles other types of indexers such as arrays or Index objects.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function `_get_with` to handle the list-like key in a manner consistent with other types of indexers, such as arrays or Index objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to list if not already list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction ensures that the key is converted to a list if it is not already list-like, which is consistent with the handling of other types of indexers. This change should resolve the KeyError issue and make the function consistent with the expected behavior.
