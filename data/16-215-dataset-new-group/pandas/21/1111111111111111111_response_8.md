Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in how the `ser[list(key)]` case is handled. It is raising a `KeyError` while the other cases are not. This inconsistency is also highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The potential cause of the bug seems to be that the handling of indexers as lists is different from how it handles other array-like indexers. The behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with the behavior for other indexers such as arrays or Pandas Index objects.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` can be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an Index object for consistency

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `key` is ensured to be an Index object for consistency by using `ensure_index(key)`. This way, the handling of list indexers is aligned with other array-like indexers.

By making this change, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers and pass the failing tests while also resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
