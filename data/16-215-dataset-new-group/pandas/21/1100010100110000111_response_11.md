The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case when a Series is indexed with a list-like object properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior with other types of indexers. The error message from the failing tests points to this inconsistency.

The cause of the bug is that when a Series is indexed with a list, it is not handled correctly, resulting in a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other types of indexers, such as arrays and Index objects.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers correctly and consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the handling of list-like indexers has been updated to be consistent with the behavior of other types of indexers. The function now checks if all elements of the list are present in the index, and if not, raises a KeyError as expected.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
