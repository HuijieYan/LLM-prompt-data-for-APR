### Analysis of the buggy function and error message

The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others. The function goes through a series of conditional checks to determine how to handle the provided key. However, it seems that the conditional checks do not handle all cases correctly, as evidenced by the error message from the failing test.

The failing test case tries to index a Series with a key that does not match any values in the Series' index. The error message indicates that the behavior for different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) is inconsistent, and there is a KeyError for the list key type. This inconsistency is a bug that needs to be fixed.

### Potential error locations within the function

The potential error locations within the function include the conditional checks for different types of keys and the subsequent handling of those keys. Specifically, the handling of list-like keys seems to be problematic based on the error message.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle all types of indexers consistently. In this case, the handling of list-like keys results in a KeyError when there are no matches in the Series' index. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other types of indexers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles all types of indexers consistently, especially when there are no matches in the Series' index. This may involve revisiting the conditional checks and the subsequent handling of different types of keys.

### Corrected version of the function

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and not all(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list-like keys has been updated to check if all elements of the list are in the Series' index. If not, a KeyError is raised to maintain consistency with other types of indexers. Additionally, the handling of integer and boolean keys has been improved to ensure consistent behavior.
