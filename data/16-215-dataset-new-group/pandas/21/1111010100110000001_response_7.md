In the provided buggy function `_get_with(self, key)`, the root cause of the bug could be the incorrect handling of different types of `key` parameters passed into the function, and the flawed decision-making process when identifying the type of `key` passed. Based on the import statements provided, we can assume that the `pandas` library is being used. 

The error messages indicate that while trying to index a Series using either a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or a pandas Series, the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected. This means that the behavior of raising the `KeyError` was not consistent across all different types of `key` parameters. This inconsistency points to the flawed decision-making process in the function.

To fix the bug, we can improve the handling of different types of `key` parameters, ensure that they are correctly identified, and then use the appropriate method to perform the indexing operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        if isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Convert to numpy array if not already an array
        key = np.asarray(key)
        
        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Check for integer type
        if is_integer(key):
            if key in self.index:
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")
  
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we improved the logic for checking the type of `key` and provided consistent handling for different `key` types. We also added checks for the existence of the `key` in the index to prevent the detected error.
