The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be caused by incorrect treatment of the `key` variable. Based on the failing tests, it appears that when `key` is a list or ndarray, the function incorrectly infers its type as `'string'`. This leads to a KeyError being raised in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of `key` is correctly inferred as `'object'` when it is a list or ndarray.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        # Fix: Ensure the correct type inference for key when it's a list or ndarray
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type is determined using `lib.infer_dtype` for lists and ndarrays. This should ensure that the correct type inference is carried out for the `key` variable and fix the bug.
