The issue is likely related to how the function handles different indexers, especially when it comes to lists. The failing test is specifically designed to show the inconsistency in behavior between different indexers.

The bug seems to be with how the function handles the `list` indexer and the inconsistency in behavior when compared to other indexers.

To fix the bug, the code for handling the `list` indexer should be modified to match the behavior of other indexers. It should be handled in a consistent way to ensure that the correct values are returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Modify the handler for the list indexer to ensure consistency with other indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handler for the `list` indexer to ensure consistency with other indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and exhibit more consistent behavior across different indexers. This should also resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
