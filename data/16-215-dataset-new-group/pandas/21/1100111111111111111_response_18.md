The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated in the `ser[key]` operation for a Series. The failing test is demonstrating this inconsistency, as it throws a KeyError for the list indexer when it doesn't for the other types such as array-like indexers.

The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to the comparison and handling of different types of indexers. The issue is likely occurring due to a misinterpretation of the indexer type or an incorrect handling of the indices.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function and to provide appropriate error handling for cases where the indexer does not match any values in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if len(key) == 0:
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the key is converted to an index using the `ensure_index` function to ensure consistency. Additionally, a check for an empty key index has been added to handle cases where there are no matches in the index.

This fix should ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and that appropriate error handling is in place for cases where there are no matches in the index. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
