Based on the provided details, the bug is caused because when key is of type list, the code doesn't handle the case where the key is not found in the index. It generates an error instead of handling it gracefully. To fix this, we need to update the code to handle the case where the key is not found in the index.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check if the key is present in the index, if not, handle it gracefully
    if not all(i in self.index for i in key):
        return pd.Series(index=key)  # Create a new Series with the given index

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function adds a check to verify if all the items in the key are present in the index. If not, it returns a new Series with the given index.

This updated function should now handle the case where the key is not found in the index and provide the expected behavior, passing the failing test.
