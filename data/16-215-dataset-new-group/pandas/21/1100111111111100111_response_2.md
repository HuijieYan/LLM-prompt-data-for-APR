The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the list-like key properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the index. This inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers is causing confusion and needs to be addressed.

A potential fix would be to ensure that all types of indexers (e.g., list, array, Index, Series) are treated consistently and properly handled within the `_get_with` function.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like key
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            key = key
        else:
            key = list(key)

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, we ensure that all indexers, including list-like indexers, are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. This should resolve the KeyError issue and make the behavior more consistent across different types of indexers as suggested in the GitHub issue.

With this fix, the failing test should pass, and the issue raised in GitHub should be resolved.
