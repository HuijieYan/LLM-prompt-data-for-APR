The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition for checking if key is an instance of ABCDataFrame is incorrect.
2. The check for key not being list-like might cause some issues.
3. The condition for checking if key is an instance of Index is incorrect.
4. The condition for checking if key is an instance of list is incorrect.

The buggy function has multiple potential error locations due to incorrect checks for the type of the 'key' parameter. These incorrect checks can lead to type-related errors or incorrect behavior when using the function.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to perform the correct type-checks for the 'key' parameter and handle each type appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bool, int, float)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the type-checks for key have been updated to handle the correct types and ensure that the function behaves as expected for different types of keys. This should resolve the potential errors and ensure correct behavior of the function.
