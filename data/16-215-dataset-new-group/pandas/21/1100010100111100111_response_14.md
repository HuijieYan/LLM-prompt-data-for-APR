The issue here seems to be inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers in the `ser` object. The test cases are failing specifically when using a list as an indexer. The error message indicates that none of the elements in the key are found in the index, which shouldn't be the case.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditionals and type checks for the `key` parameter. It seems that for some types of keys, the function is not handling the indexing correctly.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of indexers of type list, which leads to the KeyError when trying to access the Series using these indexers.

The solution for fixing this bug may involve ensuring that all types of indexers are handled consistently, such that the behavior of accessing the Series using a list indexer is consistent with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert key to a list to ensure consistent handling

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly convert the `key` to a list to ensure consistent handling and then proceed with the rest of the function. This should resolve the inconsistency in indexing behavior observed in the failing test cases.
