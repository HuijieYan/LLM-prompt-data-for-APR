After analyzing the given function and its relationship with the failing tests, it can be seen that the bug might be in the logic for handling different types of keys. The function is not able to handle the key being passed as input in the failing tests.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different key types. In the failing tests, the key passed to the function has various types such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The function fails to handle these different types of keys, leading to a KeyError in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle different types of keys and infer their types to make the appropriate decisions on how to return the values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_integer(key) or key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I removed the redundant check for the "boolean" type, as it should be handled by the existing checks for different types of keys. I also adjusted the logic for inferring the key type and handling keys of different types.

By making these changes, the corrected function should be able to handle different types of keys correctly and pass the failing tests.
