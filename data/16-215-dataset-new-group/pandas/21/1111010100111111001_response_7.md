Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class from the `pandas.core.series` module. The bug appears to be causing a `KeyError` when using the `ser[key]` operation, which is not raising the expected error. The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, leading to an unintended behavior when attempting to retrieve values from the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the different types of `key` inputs that can be passed to it, such as lists, arrays, indices, and series objects.

Here's an updated and corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version aims to handle different types of `key` inputs correctly and should address the issue of the failing tests. After applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the given inputs and produce the expected outputs, resolving the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests.
