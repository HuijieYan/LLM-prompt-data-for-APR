The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when using a list indexer, which causes inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test, which expects the same behavior for different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug lies in the `_get_with` function's handling of list-like indexers. When using a list-like indexer that doesn't match any values in the series index, it raises a `KeyError` with a message that includes the string representation of the `Index` object, rather than the actual list of index values.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This means ensuring that the error message accurately reflects the list of index values that are not found in the series index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        try:
            # Attempt to reindex with the provided list
            return self.reindex(key)
        except KeyError as e:
            # If KeyError is raised, construct a new exception with specific error message
            raise KeyError(f"None of {list(key)} are in the index") from e

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by explicitly reindexing with the provided list and, if a `KeyError` is raised, it constructs a new exception with a specific error message that accurately reflects the list of index values that are not found in the series index. This ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
