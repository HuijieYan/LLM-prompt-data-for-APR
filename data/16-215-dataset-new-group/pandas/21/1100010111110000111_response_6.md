The issue with the current `_get_with` function is that it has inconsistent handling of list indexers in comparison to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when using a list indexer, causing the failing test cases.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure consistent handling of all indexers, including list indexers, to avoid the `KeyError` and have them behave as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
	    return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the function to include consistent handling for all indexers, the `KeyError` issue should be resolved, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
