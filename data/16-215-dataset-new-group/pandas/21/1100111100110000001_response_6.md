The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different kinds of keys for indexing a Series object. 

The failing test cases indicate that when trying to retrieve an item using a key of type `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`, the expected `KeyError` is not being raised.

The issue is that the implementation of the `_get_with` function is not handling these different index types correctly. 

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the implementation of the `_get_with` function to ensure that it correctly handles the different data types of the incoming key and processes them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By making these changes, the corrected `_get_with` function should handle different types of keys correctly and raise the expected `KeyError` when the provided key is not found in the index.
