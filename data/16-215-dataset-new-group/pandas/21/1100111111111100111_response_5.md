To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. We will need to modify the code to ensure that all types of indexers behave consistently.


Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Index is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame/Index column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now behave consistently for all types of indexers, and the failing tests should pass. This fix addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

After implementing this change, run the failing tests again to ensure that the corrected function passes all the test cases.
