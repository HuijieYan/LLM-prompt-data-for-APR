Based on the runtime values, expected values, and information about the failing test and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class.

The bug seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers such as array-like indexers. The failing test case demonstrates that when using a list indexer, the function raises a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the items are in the index, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the behavior of the function when handling list indexers is consistent with the behavior of other indexers. Specifically, the function should not raise a `KeyError` for list indexers when the items are not in the index, and it should return the appropriate result or handle the case gracefully.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handle other types of indexers
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list indexers has been modified to be consistent with the handling of other types of indexers. The function now checks for list indexers specifically and returns the result of `self.reindex(key)` for list indexers, ensuring that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. This should address the inconsistency reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
