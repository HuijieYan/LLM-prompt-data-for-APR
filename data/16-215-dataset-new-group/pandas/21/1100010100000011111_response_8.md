The buggy function `_get_with` is causing problems with indexing, especially with list-like indexers. The key_type is expected to be a string, but it is not being correctly inferred in all cases. This leads to inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred for all types of indexers and that the function behaves consistently for list indexers as well as array-like indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Verify if key_type is correctly inferred
    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "boolean":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function updates the key_type inference and adds a check for "boolean" key_type, ensuring that the function behaves consistently for both list and array-like indexers. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the expected input/output values.
