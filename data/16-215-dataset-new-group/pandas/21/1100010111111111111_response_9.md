## The bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers when raising a `KeyError`. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when accessing elements of a Series using different types of indexers.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function treats all types of indexers consistently, and that it raises a `KeyError` for all unsupported indexers.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean", "datetime"]:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we removed the specific checks for list indexers and array-like indexers. Instead, we check for `is_list_like` and handle all indexers consistently. We also added checks for other types of indexers (integer, string, boolean, datetime) to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
