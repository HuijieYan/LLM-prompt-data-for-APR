The buggy function `_get_with` does not correctly handle the case when a list indexer is passed to a Series object in pandas. The issue raised on GitHub is related to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and the error raised for a list indexer.

The bug is likely occurring when a list indexer is passed to the Series and the function encounters the following condition:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
This condition causes the bug by directly using `self.loc` for a list indexer, which could lead to inconsistencies as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to treat all array-like indexers consistently, whether they are of type list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. Additionally, the function should handle the case when a list indexer is passed to the Series and avoid raising errors due to inconsistencies.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = "list"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "list"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the above corrected version, we handle the key_type as "list" for a list indexer and perform the indexing consistently using `self.loc` for all array-like indexers. This approach resolves the inconsistency issue raised on GitHub and should fix the bug.
