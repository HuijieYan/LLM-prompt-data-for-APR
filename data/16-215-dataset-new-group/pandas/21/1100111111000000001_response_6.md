The issue with the buggy function `_get_with` is that it's not handling the case when the key is an empty list. The function tries to infer the type of the key even when it's empty, which leads to an error. 

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the key is an empty list, and if so, return an empty series. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if not isinstance(key, list) or len(key) == 0:
        return self._constructor()
        
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```
