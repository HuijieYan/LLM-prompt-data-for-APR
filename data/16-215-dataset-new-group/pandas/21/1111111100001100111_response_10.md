The bug in the _get_with function arises from the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function is designed to handle different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects, but there is inconsistency in the behavior when dealing with list indexers.

When the key input parameter is a list, the function should handle it consistently with other types of indexers, but it currently does not. This inconsistency is causing the function to raise a KeyError when trying to access elements that do not exist in the Series.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle list indexers consistently

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the "if isinstance(key, list)" condition has been modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. Now, the function should be able to handle list indexers without raising a KeyError when accessing elements in the Series that do not exist. This fix aligns the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
