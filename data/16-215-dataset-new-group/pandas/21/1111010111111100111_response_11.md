The issue here seems to be with how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Series. It appears that the function is not treating list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The root cause of the bug seems to be in the handling of list indexers, where the function should treat them the same way as other array-like indexers. This is consistent with the observation that the failing test specifically targets the behavior of using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list indexers the same way it handles other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # other cases here
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the function should now treat list indexers the same as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and passing the failing test case described in the GitHub issue.
