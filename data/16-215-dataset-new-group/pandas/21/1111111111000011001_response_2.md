The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to how the `key_type` is determined and used. The function has conditional blocks to handle different types of keys, but the logic for determining the `key_type` and how it is used is causing errors.

The bug seems to be in the way it handles the `key_type` variable, as it is being incorrectly assigned and used in conditional checks. It does not accurately reflect the type of the `key`, which leads to errors in deciding how to handle the key for indexing.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for determining the `key_type` to accurately reflect the type of the `key`. Then, we need to use this `key_type` variable in the conditional checks to appropriately handle the key for indexing.

Here is the updated and corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `key_type` is accurately determined using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` and is then used in the conditional checks to appropriately handle the key for indexing.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
