To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. Based on the GitHub issue, it is clear that the behavior for list indexers should be consistent with the behavior for array-like indexers.

The issue arises when using `ser[list(key)]`, where a `KeyError` is raised, but this does not happen when using `ser[pd.Index(key)]` or `ser[np.array(key)]`. Additionally, `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases.

The key to fixing the bug is to ensure that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with array-like indexers, while also maintaining consistency with how `ser.loc[key]` behaves.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):  # Updated condition to handle both list and array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we updated the condition to handle both list and array-like indexers, ensuring consistency in behavior. This change should resolve the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test case passes.
