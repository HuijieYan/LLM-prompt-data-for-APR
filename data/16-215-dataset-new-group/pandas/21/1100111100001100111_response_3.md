The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of different types of indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior for list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The issue arises from the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function, especially in the section where it checks the type of the `key` parameter and determines the `key_type` based on its inferred type or whether it is a boolean, integer, index, list, etc.

The bug causes inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors when accessing the Series with different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we can refactor the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, removing the existing inconsistencies and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we removed the conditional checks for specific types such as `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and `not is_list_like(key)`. Instead, we only check for a slice or array-like indexers (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index), and if the key does not match any of those types, we default to reindexing with the key. This simplifies the logic and ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
