The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the difference in behavior when using different types of indexers. Specifically, the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent results. This behavior contradicts the expectations of the user, as described in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

In order to fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of indexers, whether they are array-like or list indexers. The issue in the GitHub post indicates that the behavior of the `list` case should be the desired behavior for all indexers.

To address the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner, similar to the behavior of the `list` case. This will align with the user's expectations and resolve the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)   # Ensure key is consistently treated as an index
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added `ensure_index(key)` to ensure that `key` is consistently treated as an index, regardless of its type. This modification aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and should resolve the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
