The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. When using a list indexer, the function raises a `KeyError` in some cases, while it does not raise this error when using array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistent behavior when handling different types of indexers. The code fails to handle list indexers properly, leading to the `KeyError` being raised in some cases.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function first checks if the indexer is list-like and not an instance of `np.ndarray` or `pd.Index`, and converts it to a list if needed. Then, it goes on to handle the different cases based on the type of the indexer.

This fix aims to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
