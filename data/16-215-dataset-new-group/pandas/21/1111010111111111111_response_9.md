The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of different types of indexers. It is specifically failing when a list indexer is used, resulting in a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency creates confusion for users and may lead to unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have handled list indexers using the `is_list_like` function, which ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

This fix should address the inconsistency and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
