Based on the error messages, it looks like there is an inconsistency in the behavior of the function `_get_with` when using different types of indexers with a Series. The failing test expects the behavior to be consistent for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers.

The bug is likely caused by the treatment of different types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raised KeyErrors for certain types of indexers.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to standardize the behavior of the function for different types of indexers, ensuring consistent handling of list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import statements remain unchanged

class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # ...

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, Index):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a conditional branch for the types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior, handling list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers appropriately.

This fix should address the inconsistent behavior identified in the failing tests and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
