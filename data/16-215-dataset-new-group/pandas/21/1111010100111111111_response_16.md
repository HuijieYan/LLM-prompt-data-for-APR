To address the bug in the `_get_with` function, it's important to recognize that the key being used as an indexer is not being handled consistently, leading to different results and error messages for different types of indexers.

The bug seems to stem from the conditional logic used to handle different types of indexers, leading to incorrect error messages being raised in certain cases.

To resolve the issue, we should update the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, and to handle the `list` index case in a manner similar to other index types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function incorporating these changes:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle different types of indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = make_array_key(key)

    # Use 'loc' or 'iloc' based on the indexer type
    if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we've added a condition to handle different types of indexers consistently and appropriately convert them to a `list` or an array-like key using the `make_array_key` function. We also use `loc` or `iloc` based on the type of indexer to ensure consistent behavior.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of indexers consistently and return the expected results for the failing test cases.

These changes address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and provide a fix for the bug in the original function.
