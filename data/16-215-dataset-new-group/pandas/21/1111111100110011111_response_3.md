## Correction:

The issue in the function `_get_with` is the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. To fix this, we need to ensure that the function treats all different types of indexers consistently and returns the expected results.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
After making the above correction, the fixes the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the function treats all different types of indexers consistently. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.

This fix also resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread, as the inconsistency in behavior with different indexers has been resolved.
