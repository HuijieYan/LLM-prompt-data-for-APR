To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated. Specifically, the issue arises when using a list-like indexer, which results in a KeyError that is not consistent with the behavior of other indexers.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers. When a list-like indexer is used, the function incorrectly raises a KeyError, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we will modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. Specifically, we need to ensure that when a list-like indexer is used, the function does not raise a KeyError and instead maintains consistent behavior with other indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle other types of indexers
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes outlined above, the corrected version of the function should handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, effectively resolving the inconsistency and passing the failing tests.
