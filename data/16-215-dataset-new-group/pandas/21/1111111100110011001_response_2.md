The buggy function is `_get_with`, which is a method of the `Series` class. The function is designed to return a value based on the input key. The function has a series of conditional statements to handle different input types such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and others. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the input key and determining the `key_type`.

The error messages from the failing test indicate that the function is not correctly handling the input key parameter and is not raising a `KeyError` when it should be. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the index of the key within the series.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly determine the `key_type` and handle the indexing of the key within the series. It should also raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # If the key is not found in the index, raise a KeyError
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we simplify the conditional statements and focus on correctly determining the type of the `key`. We also explicitly check if the `key` is not found in the index and raise a `KeyError` in that case. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
