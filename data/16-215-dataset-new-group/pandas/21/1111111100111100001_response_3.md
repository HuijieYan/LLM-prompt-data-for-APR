Given the error messages from the failing tests, the buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the input parameters properly and is not returning the expected output. The inputs to the function are lists, numpy arrays, pandas Series, and Index objects, but the function is not correctly processing and returning the expected results.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables right before the buggy function's return, it seems that the `key_type` is being determined as `'string'` in all cases, which is incorrect. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the type of key being passed and is not processing it appropriately.

To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, a strategy would be to modify the key type determination and handle the different types of input keys (lists, numpy arrays, pandas Series, and Index objects) appropriately. This would involve updating the conditional statements and the logic within the function to properly process and return the value based on the input key type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, additional checks and conversions are made to handle different types of input keys more robustly. The conditional statements are updated to ensure that the key type is correctly determined and processed to return the appropriate result. This should address the issues with the failing tests.
