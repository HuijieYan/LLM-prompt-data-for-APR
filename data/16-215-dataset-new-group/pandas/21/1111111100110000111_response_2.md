The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas module is causing the error. When the function is called with a list-like `key` parameter, it returns an incorrect result or raises a `KeyError`. The issue has been documented on GitHub and is related to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with indexers of different types.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the code block handling list-like keys, especially the part that checks `is_list_like(key)` and the subsequent conditionals.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. When called with a list-like key, the function either returns an incorrect result or raises a KeyError. This issue has been documented on GitHub, with a related test case breaking due to the inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key indexers consistently with other indexers. We should aim to ensure that all types of indexers produce the same behavior, avoiding incorrect results or KeyError exceptions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like keys consistently with other indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # handle other types of keys
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a conditional that checks if the `key` is list-like, and if so, we use `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the values. This change ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and potential errors. This updated logic aligns with the behavior expected by the GitHub issue and related test cases.
