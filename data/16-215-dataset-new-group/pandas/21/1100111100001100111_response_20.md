The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled, leading to inconsistent results.

The key issue seems to be that when the key is passed as a list, it is not being handled correctly, causing the inconsistency in behavior.

A strategy to fix this bug would be to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently to provide the expected behavior in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list if it's not of type list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    # Handle the different types of indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
            # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the key is consistently converted to a list if it's not already of type list. The handling of different types of indexers is also done in a more consistent manner to ensure the expected behavior in all cases. With these changes, the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved.
