The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistencies in the behavior of different types of indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions. The function is not handling different types of input indexers correctly, leading to errors in certain scenarios. 

In all the provided cases, the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` regardless of the input type, which is causing the function to take the wrong path in its execution flow.

To fix this bug, the function needs to accurately determine the type of input key and handle it appropriately. We need to ensure that the function handles different types of input indexers consistently and does not result in unexpected errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have removed the incorrect handling of different types of indexers and instead, I have added an additional conditional block to handle list, array, and index types separately. This change should ensure that the function accurately determines the type of the input key and handles it appropriately, thus resolving the inconsistencies in the behavior of different types of indexers.

This fix should address the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves consistently for different types of input indexers.
