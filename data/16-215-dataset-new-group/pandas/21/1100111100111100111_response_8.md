To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. The function is currently not handling list indexers correctly, and this is causing the failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that when the key is a list, the function is not handling it correctly and is not returning the expected result. This inconsistency is also highlighted in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of the function is compared for different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers and ensure that the function returns the expected result for all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ABCSeries, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers and return the expected result for all cases. This should resolve the failing tests and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
