## Correction

The issue arises from the inconsistent behavior of different indexers, resulting in unexpected errors. To fix this, we need to ensure that the function handles different types of indexers consistently and returns the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate Series or Index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report and satisfying the expected input/output variable values. This should resolve the reported issue and pass the failing test.
