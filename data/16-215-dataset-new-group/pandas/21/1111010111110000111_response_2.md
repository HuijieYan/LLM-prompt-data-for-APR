## Bug Analysis
The `_get_with` function is failing when the input key is an index with no matches. This is causing a `KeyError` to be raised, which is not expected behavior.

The failing test is an important scenario to consider because it demonstrates the inconsistent behavior of different types of indexers, showing that the function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, and the behavior of the function is not consistent with the different types of input indexers.

The GitHub issue provides additional context, pointing out the inconsistent behavior of the `ser.loc[key]` with respect to the different indexers, and raises the question of whether there is a compelling reason for this inconsistency.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is when handling the input key and deciding whether to return `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]`. Additionally, the error handling for different types of indexers seems to be causing inconsistent behavior.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers. This inconsistency results in `KeyErrors` being raised when using list indexers, while other types of indexers do not raise the same error and return `NaN` values. 

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it's important to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. The function `_get_with` should handle different types of indexers uniformly and avoid raising `KeyErrors` in cases where the indexer doesn't have a match.

To address the issue, the `_get_with` function needs to be revised in a way that it returns consistent results across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function handles the input key uniformly, avoiding the raising of `KeyError` errors and ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This improved approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug as well as pass the failing test.
