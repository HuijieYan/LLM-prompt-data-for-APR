The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it doesn't handle the case when a key is an instance of `pd.Index` or `pd.Series` correctly.

The expected behavior is for the function to handle the input key appropriately based on its type and return the result as per the case scenarios outlined above:

1. If the key is a list, it should be handled properly to return the result after reindexing.
2. If the key is an ndarray or Index, it should be handled appropriately.
3. If the key is a Series, it should also be handled correctly to ensure the proper output for each input type.

The bug fix strategy would involve validating the key type and handling it accordingly before proceeding with the slicing, reindexing, or 'loc' retrieval of values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle different key types appropriately
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except (KeyError, ValueError):
        pass

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function validates the key type and handles it appropriately using `try-except` blocks to handle different types of keys. It also utilizes `loc`, `iloc`, and `reindex` based on the type of the key to ensure the correct output is returned for each input type.
