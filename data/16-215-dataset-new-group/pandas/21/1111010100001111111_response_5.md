To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case where the key is a list and there are no matches. It should behave consistently for all cases, whether it's a list, array-like, or index key. 

The key issue here is that when a list key doesn't match any index values, the function should return NaN, similar to what happens with array-like and index keys.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case where key is a list and there are no matches
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return pd.Series([np.nan] * len(key), index=key)
```

This updated function ensures that if the key is a list and there are no matches, it will still return a Series with NaN values, consistent with the behavior for array-like and index keys.
