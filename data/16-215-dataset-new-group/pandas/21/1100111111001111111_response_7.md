The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to stem from the handling of different types of indexers, particularly the list indexer. The function fails to handle the list indexer correctly, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access values from the Series.

The issue is related to the inconsistency in the treatment of different types of indexers. While other array-like indexers such as np.array and pd.Index work as expected, the list indexer triggers a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the list indexer in the same way as other array-like indexers. This involves adjusting the conditional checks in the function to correctly identify and process list-based indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Correct the type checking and handling for list-based indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) or is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have explicitly checked for `is_list_like` to handle list-based indexers correctly. Additionally, we've updated the comments to reflect the changes made.

With these corrections, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-based indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and resolve the KeyError issue.
