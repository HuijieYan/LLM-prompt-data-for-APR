The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing the test to fail. The error message indicates that the function detected the wrong exception. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is used to check the behavior of the `Series` class when accessing non-existent keys. The failure occurs because the `_get_with` function does not handle key errors as expected.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of non-existent keys in the `_get_with` function. When a non-existent key is used, it should raise a `KeyError`, but currently it's not behaving as expected. The function is not handling this case properly and hence not raising the `KeyError` when an invalid key is provided.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the key does not exist in the index and raise a `KeyError` in that scenario.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError("Key not found in index")
    # rest of the code remains the same for other cases...
```

In this corrected version, a check is added to validate if the key exists in the index. If not, it raises a `KeyError`. This modification ensures that the function behaves as expected when trying to access non-existent keys.
