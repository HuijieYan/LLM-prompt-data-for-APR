The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely due to the incorrect determination of the `key_type` variable, which results in the wrong handling of the key.

The function tries to infer the type of the `key` input using `lib.infer_dtype` and handle the key based on its type. However, the inference process seems to be failing, leading to an incorrect type being assigned to `key_type`. This incorrect type then leads to the function making the wrong decision on how to handle the key.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the type inference process correctly determines the type of the `key` variable. We can achieve this by debugging the `lib.infer_dtype` function to see why it's not correctly inferring the type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we have removed the incorrect assignment of `key_type` and instead directly assigned the type inferred from the `key` using `lib.infer_dtype`.

This should fix the bug by ensuring that the type of the `key` is correctly determined and appropriately handled in the function.
