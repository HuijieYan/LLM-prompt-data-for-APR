Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, it seems that the bug occurs when using a list as an indexer for a Series. The issue is related to inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, resulting in an unexpected KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with array-like indexers. We should also ensure that the behavior aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        # Handle scalar indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is a slice or a DataFrame, and handle those cases accordingly. Then, we check if the key is not list-like and not an instance of a list or an ndarray, in which case we treat it as a scalar indexer and use `self.loc[key]`.

Finally, if the key is an instance of a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, or Index, we handle it consistently by using `self.reindex(key)`.

This corrected version ensures that the behavior is consistent with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue, and it resolves the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers.
