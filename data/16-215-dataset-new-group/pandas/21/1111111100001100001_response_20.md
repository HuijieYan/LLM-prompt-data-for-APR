To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue where the `key_type` variable is assigned the value `'string'` in all cases. This likely indicates that the logic for determining the type of the `key` parameter is incorrect.

We can modify the logic for determining the type of the `key` parameter and setting the `key_type` variable accordingly. Additionally, we can update the handling of different types of keys based on their inferred type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the redundant type checks and utilized the `lib.infer_dtype` function to infer the type of the `key` parameter. We also made adjustments to handle different types of keys based on their inferred type. This should address the issue of incorrectly setting the `key_type` variable and ensure proper handling of different types of keys.
