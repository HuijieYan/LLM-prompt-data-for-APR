The issue appears to be related to inconsistent behavior in handling indexers. The bug is likely occurring in the conditional statements, particularly in the block handling isinstance(key, list).

The bug seems to be causing the key_type variable to incorrectly have the value 'string' in all tested cases, regardless of the input, which is not the expected behavior.

The function should be fixed to correctly identify the type of the key and handle it accordingly, ensuring consistency in its behavior.

The potential strategy for fixing the bug is to review the conditional statements and the logic for determining the key_type, and adjust it to correctly identify and handle the different types of key inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif is_integer(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type: {}".format(type(key)))
```

In the corrected version, there is a distinction between different types of indexers, and the key_type is correctly identified based on the type of key input. It handles different types of keys appropriately and should resolve the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
