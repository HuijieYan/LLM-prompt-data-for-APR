The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers in a Series. The issue on GitHub indicates that using a list as an indexer raises a `KeyError`, while using other types of indexers does not. The bug stems from the part of the function where it checks the type of the key and determines the `key_type`.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional statements for the type of `key` are not handling the list type correctly, leading to an incorrect path being taken in the code.

To fix the bug, we can add a specific handling case for list-like objects in the conditional statements and ensure that the appropriate behavior is applied for lists as key indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we've added a new conditional block to handle list-like objects using `is_list_like(key)`, and modified the subsequent logic to return `self.loc[key]` for list-like objects.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
