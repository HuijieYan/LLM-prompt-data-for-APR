# The bug is in the function _get_with

# The function first checks the type of the key, if it is a slice, it calls _slice, if it is a DataFrame, it raises an error, if it's a tuple, it calls _get_values_tuple, and if it's not a list-like, it tries to use loc to access the data.

# The issue is that in the last if statement, there are conditions for different types of keys, and it's trying to decide whether to use loc or iloc to access the data based on the type of the key. There are also cases in the code where it converts the key to a list and tries to determine the dtype of the key.


# Since the conditions are already checked in the previous elif statement, there is no need to convert the key to a list and recalculate the key type. It's better to directly use either the loc or iloc method based on the type of the key.

# Another issue is with the "else" condition after the if statement. It uses the reindex method for unknown key types, which results in redundant operations. A potentially better approach would be to raise an error or handle this case differently.

# A possible solution could be to refactor the if-else block to directly use either the loc or iloc method based on the type of the key and handle unknown key types differently.


# Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```
