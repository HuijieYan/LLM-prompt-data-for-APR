## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and lists. The bug seems to occur when handling list-like indexers, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

In the failing test, the bug occurs when passing a list-like indexer `key` to the series `ser`, resulting in a KeyError indicating that none of the elements in `key` are in the series index.

During the runtime analysis, we observed that the `key_type` variable is being set to 'string' for all cases. This suggests that the logic for handling list-like indexers may be incorrect.

The GitHub issue indicates that there is inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, particularly with list-like indexers.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by inconsistent behavior when handling list-like indexers. The logic for determining the `key_type` based on the input `key` is incorrect, leading to the wrong behavior when processing list-like indexers.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when handling list-like indexers and correctly determine the `key_type` based on the input `key`. We should also consider the behavior outlined in the GitHub issue and aim to make the handling of list indexers consistent with other types of indexers.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we adjusted the logic to correctly handle list-like indexers by using the `isin` method to check if all the elements of `key` are present in the series index. If not, a KeyError is raised, ensuring consistent behavior for list-like indexers. We also maintained the existing logic for handling other types of indexers to ensure overall consistency in behavior.
