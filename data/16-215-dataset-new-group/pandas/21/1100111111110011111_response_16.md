There seem to be various issues with the `_get_with` function, particularly with handling different types of indexers. The error message indicates that the function does not handle list indexers correctly and raises a KeyError in cases where it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, one potential strategy is to explicitly handle list-like indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior. This requires properly identifying the type of indexer being used and handling it appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated function includes additional checks for list-like indexers and handles them in a similar way to other array-like indexers. This addresses the inconsistency in behavior and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

By applying this correction, the function should now handle different types of indexers consistently and produce the expected output for various input cases.
