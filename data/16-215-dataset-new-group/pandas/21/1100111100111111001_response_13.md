The bug occurs when the input `key` is passed to the `_get_with` function. The bug is likely in the section where `key` is being processed to determine its type and then handled accordingly. It seems that the code is incorrectly inferring the type of `key` in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior and the failing tests.

A potential error location is within the type inference section:
```python
if isinstance(key, Index):
    key_type = key.inferred_type
else:
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```
This code incorrectly infers the type of `key` in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug can be fixed by making sure that the type inference for `key` is accurate and consistent across different types of inputs.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    indexable = is_list_like(key)

    if indexable and not self.index.is_unique:
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer", "datetime"]:
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This version includes additional checks to ensure that the type inference of `key` is accurate and consistent, and handles different input cases appropriately. After applying these fixes, the function should pass the previously failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
