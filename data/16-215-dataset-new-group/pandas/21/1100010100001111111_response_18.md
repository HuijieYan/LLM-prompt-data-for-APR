The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests. The function should properly handle different types of input indexers to ensure consistent, expected outcomes.

The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are being treated compared to array-like indexers. The specific test case provided in the issue demonstrates that `ser[list(key)]` is causing a KeyError, while other methods of indexing do not. This inconsistency is being observed in the behavior of the function when handling different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the condition for handling list indexers is placed at the beginning of the function. This ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. This modification addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and provides a solution to the bug.
