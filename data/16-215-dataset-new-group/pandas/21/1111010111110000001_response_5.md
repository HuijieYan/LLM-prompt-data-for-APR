The root cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the extraction of values correctly when `key` is a Series object of a specific dtype (in this case, dtype=object). When `key` is converted to a numpy array or other types, the bug does not occur, indicating that the `isinstance(key, tuple)` is functioning correctly.

The `test_getitem_no_matches` function is testing how the Series object handles a key (`box`) where no matches exist in the index. It expects a KeyError to be raised with a specific error message, which indicates that the key was not found in the index.

To fix the bug, we can directly extract the values from the `key`, which is expected to be a Series. This will allow the Series object to properly handle the key when it is of type Series, preventing mismatching data types and raising a KeyError as expected by the test case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = np.array(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This modification ensures that whenever `key` is not list-like, it is converted to a numpy array. This will allow the correct handling of Series objects as keys and prevent the KeyError from being falsely suppressed.
