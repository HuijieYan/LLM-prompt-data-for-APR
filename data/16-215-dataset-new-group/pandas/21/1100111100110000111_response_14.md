The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

The bug occurs when using a list indexer with a `key` that has no matches in the Series index. The function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected, and instead, continues with the code, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

The bug is due to the handling of list-like indexers and the different behavior exhibited when the key has no matches in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers (arrays, Index objects, Series) are handled.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should consistently raise a `KeyError` when the `key` has no matches in the Series index, regardless of the type of indexer used.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        indexer = ensure_index(key)
    except InvalidIndexError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    indexer = ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    if isnan(indexer).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `ensure_index` function to coerce `key` to an index, and then we check for `InvalidIndexError` and `nan` values to raise a `KeyError` if the key has no matches in the index.

This corrected version will align the behavior for all different types of indexers and consistently raise a `KeyError` when the `key` has no matches in the Series index. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
