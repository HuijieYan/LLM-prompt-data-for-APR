## The buggy function
The function `_get_with` has several issues related to the handling of different types of indexers. The function is supposed to handle different types of indexers and return the appropriate values based on the type of the indexers. However, there are inconsistencies in the handling of indexers, especially with list-like indexers.

## Potential error locations
1. The conditional statements for handling different types of indexers do not cover all possible cases.
2. The handling of key_type is inconsistent and may lead to incorrect results.
3. The reindex method may not be called properly.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy function does not handle the different types of indexers consistently, especially when it comes to list-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to incorrect behavior and unexpected results, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the conditional statements to cover all possible cases of indexers.
2. Ensure that the key_type is determined consistently and accurately for all indexer types.
3. Revise the logic for calling the reindex method to handle different indexer types correctly.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = "array_like"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "array_like"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the conditional statements have been updated to handle different types of indexers, including list-like indexers and arrays. The determination of key_type has been revised to ensure consistency for all indexer types. The logic for calling the reindex method has been adjusted to handle different types of indexers correctly. These changes should help the function to return the expected results for all cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
