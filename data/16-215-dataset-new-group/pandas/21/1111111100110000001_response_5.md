The issue appears to be with the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. The failing test is related to indexing operations. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling index key errors properly and is failing to raise a `KeyError` as expected.

The `_get_with` function is attempting to handle indexing by different key types. However, it fails to properly handle the scenarios involving lists, arrays, indexes, and series.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to revise the logic for handling different key types and ensure that the function behaves consistently with the expected behavior of a pandas `Series`.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle string indexing
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This revised function includes additional logic to properly handle string indexing, as well as indexing using other key types. This should address the issues seen in the failing tests.
