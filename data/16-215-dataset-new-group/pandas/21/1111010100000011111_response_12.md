The buggy function `_get_with` contains conditional blocks that handle different types of input keys. However, there are potential error locations in the code related to the determination of `key_type` and the handling of `Index` objects.

The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list compared to other indexers, as described in the GitHub issue. The function does not handle list indexers appropriately, leading to unexpected results and inconsistencies with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers and that it accurately determines the `key_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers and accurately determine the `key_type`. This should resolve the inconsistent behavior and fix the bug.
