The issue appears to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing a Series with keys that do not match any index values.

In the buggy function, the cause of the bug could be the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling the different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior and proper error handling.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # other methods remain the same

    # this is the corrected function
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_scalar(key) or (is_list_like(key) and not is_array-like(key)):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the logic to check if the key is a scalar or if it is a list-like but not array-like, we can achieve consistent behavior for all types of indexers, thus resolving the issue identified in the GitHub post.
