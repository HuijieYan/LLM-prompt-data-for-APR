The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to lie in the part where it checks the type of the `key` input and attempts to handle it accordingly. The function currently incorrectly identifies the type and fails to match it to the correct indexing method. 

The cause of the bug stems from the misidentification of the type of the `key` input, which then leads to incorrect handling of the indexing method. This ultimately results in failing tests, as the function does not retrieve the correct values based on the input key.

To fix this bug, the function should accurately identify the type of the `key` input and ensure that the corresponding indexing method is applied appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self._get_values(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not is_categorical_dtype(key):
        return self._get_listlike(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, it should now accurately identify the type of the `key` input and handle the indexing method accordingly, allowing it to pass the failing test and return the expected results.
