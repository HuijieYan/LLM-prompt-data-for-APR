The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The function is not handling the list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a KeyError in certain cases.

The error locations in the `_get_with` function are likely in the handling of different index types, especially when transforming the key into a list and determining the key type.

The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The failing test is expecting a KeyError when using a list key, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is in line with expectations and that it does not raise a KeyError in this particular case.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = [key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that both list indexers and other array-like indexers are handled consistently and that the behavior matches the expected output. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and pass the failing test.
