The issue lies in the `_get_with` function, where the logic for handling the input `key` is incorrect, resulting in a KeyError in the failing test cases. The function incorrectly identifies `key` as a string type, when it should be handled differently based on its data type.

To fix this, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle different types of input keys, such as list, ndarray, and Index, and return the corresponding data from the Series.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (str, int)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError("Invalid key type")
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks for specific data types of the input key and handles them accordingly. If the input key is a string or an integer, it uses the `loc` attribute of the Series to access the corresponding data. If the input key is a slice, tuple, list, ndarray, or Index, it performs operations based on the respective data types.

This corrected version should handle the various input types correctly and pass the failing tests.
