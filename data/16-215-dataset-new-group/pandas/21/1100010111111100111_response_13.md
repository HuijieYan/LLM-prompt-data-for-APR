The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by a mismatch in the behavior of different types of indexers when used with a Series. Specifically, the list indexer case is not handled consistently with other types of indexers. This inconsistency causes the `test_getitem_no_matches` test to fail with a `KeyError` when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with other indexers. This will involve handling the list indexer case in a similar manner to how other indexers are handled, and ensuring that the appropriate error messages are raised consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid key type")
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `ensure_index` to handle list-like keys consistently.
2. We check the inferred type of the key and handle it accordingly, including handling string and integer keys using `loc` and `iloc` as appropriate.
3. We raise a `ValueError` for invalid key types, to ensure that the function fails consistently for unsupported types of keys.

This correction ensures that the `_get_with` function handles list-like keys consistently and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.
