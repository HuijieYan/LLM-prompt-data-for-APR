The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing a KeyError when trying to retrieve an item with a list, numpy array, Index, or Series as the key. The function is incorrectly handling the input key, leading to the error.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly identifying the type of the input `key`, and the conditional logic for handling different types of keys is flawed, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to properly identify the type of the input `key` and handle each type appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should handle different types of keys correctly and avoid the KeyError that was occurring before.
