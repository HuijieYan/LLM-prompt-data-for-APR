The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The issue posted on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The bug can be seen when trying to access a Series using a list indexer (`ser[list(key)]`) where it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` as it does with other indexers. This is inconsistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers such as `pd.Index(key)` or `np.array(key)`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and handle the list indexer (`ser[list(key)]`) in the same way as other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    # handle the case for DataFrame indexer
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "floating"]:
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type in ["object", "mixed-integer-float"]:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added an additional condition to handle indexers of type integer and floating to use `iloc`, while indexers of type object and mixed-integer-float will use `loc`. This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers. Additionally, I removed the `is_scalar` check as it is not necessary and can be handled by the existing conditions.
