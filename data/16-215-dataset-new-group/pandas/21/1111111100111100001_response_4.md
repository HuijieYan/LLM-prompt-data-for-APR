The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by the incorrect handling of the input `key` when it is a list-like object. The function is not properly checking for the type of `key` in the list-like case, causing a failure in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling list-like objects as the input `key`, and ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of `key` and processes it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or ndarray is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or ndarray indexing"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the list-like case separately using the `is_list_like` function to identify if the input `key` is list-like. If it is, we use `loc` to index the Series with the key.

This should fix the bug and make the function work correctly for the failing test cases provided.
