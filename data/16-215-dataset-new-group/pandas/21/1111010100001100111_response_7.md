To resolve the issue, it seems that there is inconsistency in the handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `Series` class. The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior of `ser[key]` should be the same as `ser[list(key)]`, and that only one test breaks when making these cases behave the same way.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of list indexers, where the `key` variable is a list. When using `ser[key]`, it raises a KeyError when `key` is a list, but it does not raise the KeyError when `key` is an array-like object. This inconsistency is causing confusion and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the handling of the list indexers should be adjusted to match the behavior of array-like indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the conditions have been adjusted to handle list indexers, array-like indexers, and scalar keys in a consistent manner. This should align the behavior of `ser[key]` with `ser[list(key)]` and resolve the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
