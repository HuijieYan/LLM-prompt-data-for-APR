The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of list indexers, which is different from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. The issue is highlighted in the failing test where a list key raises a `KeyError`, while other types of indexers do not. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled in the function.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should treat list indexers the same way it treats array-like indexers. Additionally, the function should handle all indexers consistently, regardless of their type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, all types of key indexers are handled in the same way, leading to consistent behavior across different indexer types. This change addresses the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function passes the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values.
