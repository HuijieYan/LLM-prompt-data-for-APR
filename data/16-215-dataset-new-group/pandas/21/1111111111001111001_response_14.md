First, it is important to notice that the function `_get_with` is expected to handle a variety of input types for the `key` parameter. It should apply different operations depending on whether `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or other data types.

Analyzing the failure in the test function `test_getitem_no_matches`, the error message indicates that the intended behavior is to raise a KeyError when none of the given index values are found in the Series index.

Based on the runtime and expected values, it seems that the bug is related to the assignment of the `key_type` variable within the `_get_with` function. The variable `key_type` is intended to determine the type of the `key` parameter, and based on that type, a specific operation should be performed. However, in the provided runtime and expected values, the `key_type` variable seems to be incorrectly set to `'string'` for all cases, regardless of the input type.

It appears that the logic to determine the `key_type` is not properly distinguishing between the different types of inputs for the `key` parameter.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` needs to be updated to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and then apply the corresponding operations based on that type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Determine the key_type based on the type of key
    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key_type = 'scalar'

    if key_type == 'scalar':
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is determined based on the type of the `key` parameter, and different operations are applied for each type of `key`. This should address the issue where the function was incorrectly categorizing key types as `'string'` and lead to the correct behavior with different input types for the `key`.
