The cause of the bug is that the original function `_get_with` is not handling the list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access values from the Series using a list key.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will involve updating the conditionals and decision-making code to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the code now properly handles list indexers and should resolve the KeyError issue encountered in the failing tests. This update also aligns with the discussions in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]."
