The issue seems to be related to inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated in the `Series` object. The function `_get_with` is not handling different types of indexers consistently, leading to unexpected results and raising errors.

The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, which results in incorrect handling of indexes and list-like objects.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers and list-like objects. Specifically, we need to align the behavior with the expected outcome described in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The key changes in the corrected version are in the handling of different types of indexers and list-like objects. This version ensures that all indexers and list-like objects are handled consistently and in line with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
