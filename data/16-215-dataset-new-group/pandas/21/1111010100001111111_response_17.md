To fix the bug, we need to change the condition for checking the type of the key, and handle the string and list-like keys differently.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (str, np.str)):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # All other types
    return self.reindex(key)
```

Here's a breakdown of the changes:
- Changed the condition to check for a string-type key using `isinstance(key, (str, np.str))`. This will handle string keys appropriately.
- Removed the condition for checking if the key is an Index, as it was redundant.
- Added a new condition to check if the key is list-like using `is_list_like(key)`. This handles cases where the key is a list or other list-like data structures.

With these changes, the function now appropriately differentiates between a string-like key and a list-like key and should work as expected based on the provided input/output values and the GitHub issue.
