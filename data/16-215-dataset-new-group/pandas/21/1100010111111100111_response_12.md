The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely the cause of the failing test. The function does not handle all index types correctly, leading to a KeyError when using a list-like indexer. The issue in GitHub also addresses this inconsistency and potential bug.

The bug is likely caused by the failure to handle the list indexers correctly, leading to the KeyError. This inconsistency stems from not treating all index types in a uniform manner.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that the treatment of list indexers aligns with the treatment of other index types.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)): 
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle list indexers in a manner consistent with other array-like indexers. With these changes, the failing test should pass, and the issue in GitHub should be resolved.
