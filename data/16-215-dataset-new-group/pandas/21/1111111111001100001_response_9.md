Since we do not have access to the full source code, it's a bit difficult to fully fix the function, but based on the failing test and the provided information, it seems that the issue might lie in the `_get_with` function's treatment of the `key` variable.

In the failing test, the `key` variable is created as a Series object, but it's being cast to different types like list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series in the test. This suggests that the `_get_with` function is not handling these different types of inputs properly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function can handle all the different types that the `key` variable might be passed as, and process them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the provided information:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle different types of keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed"]:
            return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of the different types of `key` that could be passed to the function, ensuring that they are processed appropriately. This should address the failing test cases.
