The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to how different indexers are handled. The function seems to treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers consistently with array-like indexers. This inconsistency is causing the function to raise a KeyError for the list indexer, while not raising it for the other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers and array-like indexers are handled consistently, resolving the inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
