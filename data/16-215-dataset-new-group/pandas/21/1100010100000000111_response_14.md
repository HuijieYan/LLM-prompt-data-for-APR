The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers and array-like indexers. This is evident from the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches."

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The conditional check for `is_list_like(key)` may not handle all cases correctly based on the information provided in the GitHub issue.
2. The handling of different types of indexers (`list`, `Index`, `np.ndarray`, etc.) may lead to inconsistent behavior and incorrect indexing.

The cause of the bug is likely due to inconsistent behavior in dealing with list indexers and array-like indexers, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function may fail to handle certain cases where the indexers do not match with the series, resulting in an incorrect or inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers and improve the conditional checks to handle all cases appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers by properly checking for the type of the `key` and then using appropriate indexing methods (`loc` or `iloc`). Additionally, it addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report by handling list indexers and array-like indexers consistently.
