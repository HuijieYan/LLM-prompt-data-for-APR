The issue seems to have raised from inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers for a pandas Series. When indexing with a list, a KeyError is raised, while indexing with other types does not raise the same error.

The buggy function `_get_with` is likely causing this issue. The 'if not is_list_like(key)' condition is triggering the error. It is treating a list differently from other types of indexers.

To resolve the issue, we need to update the code to handle list indexers similarly to other types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert key to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated implementation will treat list indexers similarly to other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
