The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by incorrect handling of the input key and failing to properly handle cases where the key is not found in the index. The function expects the key to be either a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object. When the key is not found in the index, it should raise a KeyError, but the function doesn't handle this correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of the key and properly raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # raise KeyError if the key is not found in the index
            if key not in self.index:
                raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            # raise KeyError if any key is not found in the index
            for k in key:
                if k not in self.index:
                    raise KeyError(f"{k} not found in the index")
            return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle cases where the key is not found in the index and raise a KeyError.

This should address the bug and make the failing tests pass.
