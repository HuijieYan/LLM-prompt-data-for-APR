The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is causing an inconsistency when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers in some cases. This inconsistency leads to different behavior and error messages when using different types of indexers, violating the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

The bug is specifically located within the block of code that checks for the list-like indexer and further handles it. The related GitHub issue emphasizes the inconsistency in behavior and the aim is to align the behavior of all types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code block handling list-like indexers and ensure that it follows the same path as other array-like indexers. By handling list indexers similarly to how other indexers are handled, we can achieve consistency in behavior and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, it should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub. This fix ensures that list indexers are handled consistently, aligning their behavior with other types of array-like indexers.
