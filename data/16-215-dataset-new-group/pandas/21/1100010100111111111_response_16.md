Based on the analysis and the failing tests, the issue appears to be with how the function handles list-like indexers, causing inconsistency and raising a KeyError for certain cases. The bug likely lies in the conditional checks and the handling of list-like indexers within the function.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers and to avoid raising a KeyError in these cases. Additionally, the function should handle list-like indexers in a manner similar to how it handles other types of indexers such as arrays and Index objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bytes)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles list-like indexers and avoids raising a KeyError for these cases. This should resolve the inconsistency and the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
