The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, which is resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to access the index. The `KeyError` is raised because the function is not correctly handling the list-like key and is failing to find it in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys. We can do this by using the `loc` method with list-like keys, as it will correctly handle the indexing for both Series and Index types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this fix, the `_get_with` function will now correctly handle list-like keys and should pass the failing tests, resolving the issue reported on GitHub. This fix ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and resolves the `KeyError` that was being raised for list-like keys.
