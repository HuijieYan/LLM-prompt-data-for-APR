The function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of input `key` and return the corresponding result based on its type. However, it seems to be failing when dealing with `key` types such as `list`, `ndarray`, and `Index`, which results in a `KeyError` when using the `ser[key]` notation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles these different types of input keys and returns the correct result without raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This version should properly handle different input key types and avoid raising `KeyError` when using the `ser[key]` notation in the failing tests.
