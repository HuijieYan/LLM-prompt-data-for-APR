The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a KeyError when using list indexers.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner, avoiding the KeyError and ensuring that all types of indexers behave uniformly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled consistently, avoiding the KeyError and providing uniform behavior for different types of indexers. This fix should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers.
