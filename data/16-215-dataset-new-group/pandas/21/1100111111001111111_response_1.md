The issue here is that the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies in behavior.

The problem is occurring when the function tries to handle list-like indexers. It should treat all array-like indexers in a consistent manner, but it currently raises a `KeyError` for the list case, while the other array-like indexers do not raise the error.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle all array-like indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior is the same for list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all array-like indexers in a consistent manner
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError as e:
        # If KeyError is raised, use reindex to handle the indexer
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will handle array-like indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that all cases are treated the same way and inconsistencies in behavior are resolved.
