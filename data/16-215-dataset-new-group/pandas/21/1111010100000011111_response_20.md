Based on the function and the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue lies in the inconsistent behavior when using different indexers for a Series. The bug seems to manifest when using a list indexer resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the key passed to the function is converted to an Index using `ensure_index`, which allows consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
