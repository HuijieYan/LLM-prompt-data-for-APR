The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are treated in the `_get_with` function. The function should handle the different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc.) in a consistent manner, but it's currently failing to do so.

The bug occurs when the `key` is a list-like object, and the function attempts to handle it incorrectly. The function should treat the `key` as a positional indexer or label-based indexer based on the type of the key and the associated series index.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like keys correctly, ensuring that it treats them consistently and outputs the expected values.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list-like keys consistently
    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Treat other cases as label-based indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are treated consistently and appropriately either as label-based or positional indexers based on the type of the key and the associated series index. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
