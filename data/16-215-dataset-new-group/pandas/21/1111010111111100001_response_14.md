The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing it to return an incorrect value for the variable `key_type`. The issue lies in the conditional block for determining the type of the key.

The bug is that the function always sets the `key_type` variable to `'string'` regardless of the actual data type of the key. This happens because the conditional blocks following the assignment of `key_type` do not appropriately cover all possible types of the `key`.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the conditional blocks to handle all possible types of the `key`. This involves checking for other list-like types and ensuring that `key_type` is set based on the actual type of the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added an additional conditional block to handle the case when the `key` is not of any of the known list-like types or objects. This helps to set `key_type` correctly based on the actual type of the `key`. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the correct `key_type` for further processing.

Overall, these changes would fix the bug and make the `_get_with` function behave as expected.
