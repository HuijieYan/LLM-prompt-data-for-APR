The issue seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list. It is treated differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies and leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it seems that the root cause of the bug is in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, specifically in the handling of `list` indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of `ser[key]` is consistent across different types of indexers, including lists, arrays, and Index objects.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Consistently handle all indexers
    return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for consistent behavior
```

In the corrected version, the code consistently uses `self.loc[key]` to handle all types of indexers, ensuring that the behavior is the same across different types. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the function pass the failing tests.

By making this change, we ensure that the behavior of indexing with different types of indexers is consistent, addressing the reported issue.
