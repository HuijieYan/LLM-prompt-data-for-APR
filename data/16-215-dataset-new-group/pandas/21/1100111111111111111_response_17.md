The issue here seems to be that the function `_get_with` does not handle the case of a list-like key properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when trying to access a Series with a list-like key.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By using the `ensure_index` function, we ensure that the key will be consistently treated as an Index, regardless of its original type. This approach should resolve the inconsistency and prevent the KeyError when accessing a Series with a list-like key.

Please note that the `_get_with` function has been modified to handle list-like keys in a manner consistent with array-like indexers.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should pass all failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
