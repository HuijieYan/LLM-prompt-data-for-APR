The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class from pandas is returning a KeyError when a Series contains an object and a non-existent key. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series properly.

The code is trying to index the `Series` with a key where the key is a Series with dtype of object, and the key is a non-existent value. However, the bug is that the code is not properly handling this case, leading to a KeyError.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the function to handle the case when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series properly, especially when the key contains non-existent values.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # ensure key is a list
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"The key {key} does not exist in the index")
```

This corrected version will handle the case when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series properly, and it will return a KeyError with the appropriate message when the key contains non-existent values.
