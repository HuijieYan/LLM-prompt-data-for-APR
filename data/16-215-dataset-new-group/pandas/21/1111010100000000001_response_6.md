The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is checking for a tuple before checking for whether the key is list-like. This results in not handling tuple keys properly. Additionally, there could be an issue with the check for `is_list_like` which is not efficient and might be causing some inconsistencies.

To fix this bug, we should first check for list-like keys, and then for tuple keys. After that, we need to address the inefficient check for `is_list_like` by improving its handling.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_scalar(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check for list-like keys using the `is_list_like` function. If it is list-like, we call the `_get_values_tuple` function. If the key is not list-like and not a scalar, we can then safely assume it is a tuple key and use `reindex` to handle it. If the key is a scalar, we can safely use `loc` to access it.
