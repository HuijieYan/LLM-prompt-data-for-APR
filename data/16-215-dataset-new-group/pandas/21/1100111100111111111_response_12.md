The issue seems to be related to treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers in the `Series` class, which leads to inconsistent behavior and incorrect error handling. The failing test demonstrates that the behavior of `ser[key]` and `ser[pd.Index(key)]` is different from `ser[np.array(key)]` and `ser[list(key)]`.

Upon reviewing the cases and their expected outputs, it appears that the bug lies in the handling of list-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and incorrect error handling.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of handling list-like indexers, such as `ser[list(key)]`, is consistent with other array-like indexers. This means that for all types of indexers, the behavior should be similar, and error handling should be consistent across different types of indexers.

We need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers consistently and ensure that the error handling for all types of indexers is the same.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Treat all types of indexers consistently
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except (KeyError, IndexError):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and a consistent approach to error handling.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring a more consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
