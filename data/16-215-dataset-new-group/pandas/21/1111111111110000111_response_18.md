The bug is in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, where it is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. When a list indexer is used, it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning a `NaN` as expected for non-matches.

To fix the bug, the issue must be handled where list-like indexers are used, and it should return `NaN` instead of raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Handling the case where list-like indexers are used
    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function will handle list-like indexers properly and return `NaN` for non-matches instead of raising a `KeyError`, which should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
