The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. It is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate values. The issue is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and a KeyError when using a list indexer.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic of handling indexers, especially when the indexer is a list. When the indexer is a list, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. We also need to address the inconsistency with `ser.loc[key]` raising for all cases.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already an array-like type
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Treating key as a label-based indexer
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that all indexers, including list indexers, are consistently handled as label-based indexers, avoiding the KeyError issue raised in the failing test.

By making this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
