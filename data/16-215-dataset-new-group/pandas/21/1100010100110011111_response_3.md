### The buggy function and its relationship with the corresponding error message, the expected input/output values, the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series and return the corresponding values. The function is expected to handle indexers of type slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index. The function is failing when dealing with a list-like indexer, leading to a `KeyError`.

The failing test is trying to access a Series using a list-like indexer, and it expects a `KeyError` to be raised. However, the function is not returning the expected error, so the test is failing. The values and types of variables during the failing test execution are not being handled correctly by the function.

The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" is addressing the inconsistency in the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list-like indexer compared to other indexer types.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The function may have potential errors in the block that handles list-like indexers and the determination of the `key_type`.

### Explanation of the cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. When the function encounters a list-like indexer, it is not returning the correct behavior, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing test. This is in line with the GitHub issue's observation of inconsistencies in behavior when using list-like indexers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle list-like indexers and return the expected behavior, consistent with other types of indexers. Additionally, the determination of the `key_type` needs to be accurate to ensure the correct path is taken for processing the indexer.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Remove the unnecessary block for list handle duplication
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the list-like indexer and ensure that the expected error is raised when accessing a Series with a list-like indexer, addressing the failing test and the GitHub issue's concerns about inconsistent behavior.
