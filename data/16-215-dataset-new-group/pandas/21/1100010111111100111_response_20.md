The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the pandas library, used for indexing a Series object with a given key. The function contains multiple conditional statements to handle different types of input keys, but it fails to handle the case where a list-like key does not match any values in the Series index. This issue has been reported on GitHub as "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches" where the behavior of indexing with different types of keys is inconsistent.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is a parameterized test that tests the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that does not match any values in the Series index. It expects a KeyError to be raised with a specific error message in this case.

Based on the provided information and failed test cases, it seems that the bug occurs when the function tries to handle a list-like key that does not match any values in the Series index.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements inside the `_get_with` function need to be modified to handle the case where a list-like key does not match any values in the Series index. This could involve explicitly checking if any elements in the key exist in the index before attempting to use it for indexing.

Below is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        missing_values = [value for value in key if value not in self.index]
        if missing_values:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_values} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, after checking if the key is list-like, a check is added to find any elements in the key that are not present in the Series index. If any such elements are found, a KeyError is raised with the appropriate message.

This should address the issue of inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with keys that do not match any values in the Series index and should also resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
