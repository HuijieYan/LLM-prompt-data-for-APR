The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable. The function attempts to determine the type of the `key` variable, but certain cases are not correctly handled, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the `key` variable is correctly determined and handled in each conditional branch. Additionally, we need to address the cases where the `key` variable is not recognized as a list-like or integer type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # If key is integer, use iloc, otherwise use loc
    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we handle the determination of the `key_type` explicitly and use it to decide whether to use `iloc` or `loc` for indexing the series.

This fix should resolve the issues identified in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
