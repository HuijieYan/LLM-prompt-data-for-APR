The buggy function `_get_with` is performing different operations based on the type of the input `key`. It's not handling the case where `key` is a list correctly, and is resulting in inconsistent behavior.

The bug is causing the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` to raise a KeyError when using a list as the indexer. This behavior is inconsistent with how the function treats other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when handling different types of input `key`. We can modify the code to handle the case when the `key` is a list to behave similarly to the behavior when indexing with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # handle the case when the key is a list or array-like
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    elif not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
```

This version ensures that when the `key` is a list or array-like, it will use the `reindex` method, providing consistent behavior with other array-like indexers.

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` should pass, and the issue mentioned in the GitHub report should be resolved.
