The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when dealing with list indexers, array-like indexers, and pandas Series.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling list indexers properly, leading to inconsistent behavior, as described in the GitHub issue. It treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to an unexpected KeyError when using a list indexer.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistent behavior and fixing the KeyError issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
