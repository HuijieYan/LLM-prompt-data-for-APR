The bug in the function appears to stem from the logic surrounding the determination of the `key_type` variable. It seems that the function incorrectly handles different types of input for the `key` parameter and makes incorrect assumptions about the type of key, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully evaluate the type of the `key` input and ensure that the `key_type` variable is determined accurately based on the input type.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've added a check using the `is_scalar` function to handle cases where the `key` is a scalar value. We've also removed the unnecessary type checks and improved the logic for determining the `key_type` variable.

This should address the potential issues with the function and ensure that the correct type of indexing is used based on the type of `key`.
