Looking at the buggy function and the failing tests, it appears that the issue might be related to the handling of the key parameter. This key is used to access elements from the Series object. However, the function seems to treat all keys as if they are of type "string", which is not the case. This can lead to incorrect indexing and consequently, the KeyError in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the type of the key being used and handle it appropriately. We should also ensure that the key is being processed correctly to retrieve the desired data from the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- We check for the correct types of the key parameter and handle them accordingly.
- We use the `inferred_type` property if the key is an Index, to accurately determine the type of indexing required.
- We also handle the `Index` type separately to ensure that the key is processed correctly.

This corrected version should address the indexing issues and fix the failing tests.
