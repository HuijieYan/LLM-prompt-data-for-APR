The issue originates from the inconsistent behavior of list indexers and other array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` operation for a Pandas Series. The provided bug function `_get_with` does not handle the list key correctly and raises a KeyError in certain cases.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The handling of index types in the conditions that lead to the KeyError.
2. Incorrect type inference for the `key_type` variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle the list key correctly and raises a KeyError. This inconsistency is the result of discrepancies in the treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The failing test depicts a scenario where the list key is expected to return a KeyError, while other array-like indexers do not exhibit the same behavior.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the conditions for handling different index types, ensuring that list indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_integer(key):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the corrections to the conditions and handling of different index types, the behavior of the corrected function will be consistent across all array-like indexers and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
