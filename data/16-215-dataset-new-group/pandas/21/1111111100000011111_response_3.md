The buggy function `_get_with` seems to be incorrectly handling different types of indexers and causing an inconsistency in behavior. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is an inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the inconsistent handling of indexers, especially when it comes to lists. The inconsistency is causing issues with retrieving values from the Series.

To fix the bug, we'll need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled uniformly and consistently, so the behavior is predictable and correct in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've removed redundant checks for the type of key and consistently use `lib.infer_dtype` to determine the type. Additionally, we've consolidated the handling of lists and other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across all types.

This fix should address the inconsistency and provide a uniform and predictable behavior for all types of indexers.
