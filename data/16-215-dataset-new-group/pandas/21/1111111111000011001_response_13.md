The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable, which is used to determine the type of the `key` input parameter. In the failing test case, the `key` is supposed to be a string, but the function incorrectly assigns the `key_type` as "integer" in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine the type of the `key` input parameter and adjust the logic accordingly. We can use the `dtype` attribute of the `key` to infer its type and then use that information to make the appropriate decisions within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Using dtype to infer the type of the key
    key_type = key.dtype

    if key_type == 'object':  # Assuming 'object' type refers to the string type
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # For other types, including 'integer'
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer (i.e. self.iloc)
        # or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we use the `dtype` attribute of the `key` to infer its type. For keys of type 'object' (which we assume to refer to strings), we use `self.loc[key]`, and for other types, including 'integer', we make decisions based on the index type and use `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]` accordingly.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
