The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by incorrectly inferring the type of the `key` parameter and not handling it appropriately in the subsequent logic. The logic to determine the `key_type` is flawed and leads to incorrect handling of the key parameter, resulting in unexpected outcomes.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic to determine the type of `key` and handle each type appropriately as per the code documentation and expected behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        # Correct logic for key type handling
        key_types = [list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index]
        if not isinstance(key, key_types):
            # handle scalars or non-recognized types
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we have added additional checks for different types of keys and handled each case based on the key type as expected in the documentation.

This corrected version should handle the input cases correctly and satisfy the expected input/output values.
