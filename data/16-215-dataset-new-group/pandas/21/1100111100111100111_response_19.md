## Fixing the bug

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. By analyzing the failing test cases and the related GitHub issue, it is evident that there is inconsistency in the behavior when using different indexers such as list, array, Index, and Series. The failing test cases provide examples of this inconsistency.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, and make sure that the correct error messages are raised when there are no matches in the index.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior and error messages.
2. Ensure that when there are no matches in the index, the appropriate KeyError is raised, and the error message is consistent across different types of indexers.

Now, let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the identified issues.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        if not len(key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional(key):
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We have updated the logic to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, and to raise the appropriate KeyError when there are no matches in the index.
- We use `ensure_index` to ensure that the key is converted to an Index, and if the length of the index is 0, we raise a KeyError with the appropriate message.
- We check for boolean indexers using `is_bool` and apply `loc` based on that condition.
- We have used `lib.infer_dtype` to determine the type of the indexer and handle integer indexers based on whether they should fallback to positional indexing.

With these updates, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
