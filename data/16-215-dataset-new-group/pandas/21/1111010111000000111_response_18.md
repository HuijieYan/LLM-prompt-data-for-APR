The potential error in the `_get_with` function is the handling of the `else` condition with the `is_list_like(key)` check. This is where the bug is likely located as it is responsible for reindexing the key.

The bug is due to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, as described in the GitHub issue. The bug causes a KeyError when using a list as an indexer, while other array-like indexers behave differently.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the reindexing logic for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the corrected `_get_with` function should now handle both list and other array-like indexers consistently, resolving the issue and passing the failing test described in the GitHub issue.
