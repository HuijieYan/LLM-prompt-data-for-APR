The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when using a list-like indexer while other types of indexers do not raise the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. We can modify the function to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other indexers, such as arrays or Index objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This updated version of the `_get_with` function ensures that all types of indexers are handled in a consistent manner, avoiding the `KeyError` that was previously raised when using a list-like indexer.

With this change, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
