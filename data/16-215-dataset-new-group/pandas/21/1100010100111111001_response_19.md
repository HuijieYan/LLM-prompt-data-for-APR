The bug in the given function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` variable before the `return` statement. Based on the runtime values and types of the variables, and the expected values and types of the variables, it appears that the issue lies in how the `key` variable is processed and the `key_type` variable is derived. 

The function should be updated to ensure that the correct type for the `key` variable is determined, and the appropriate operation is performed based on that type.

Below is the fixed and corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/series.py

# this is the corrected function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, MultiIndex)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or MultiIndex is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Float64Index, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCMultiIndex, ABCPeriodIndex)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            key_type = "boolean"
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `key` variable is first checked for different types and then processed accordingly. Additionally, the `key` variable is converted to the appropriate type using `ensure_index` which should help prevent unexpected behavior. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values.
