The `__getitem__` method of the Series class slices, indexes, and generally gets a value from the Series object. The `_get_with` method within the Series class, which is used by the `__getitem__` method, is the buggy function we need to fix. The `_get_with` method checks the type of the key and returns the values accordingly; the issue is with the handling of non-list-like keys and list-like keys which are not of type `Index`.

Based on the buggy function and the failing test, the cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` method is not handling list-like keys properly with non-Index types. It is also not correctly handling non-list-like keys. This leads to a KeyError during indexing with the incorrect type of the key.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the non-list-like keys are handled properly and that list-like keys which are not of type `Index` are converted to a list before further processing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys which are not of type Index
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = list(key)  # convert non-index list-like keys to a list
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the previously failing test should now pass.
