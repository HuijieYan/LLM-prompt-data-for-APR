The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the checking and handling of the key type. The function is expecting certain behaviors and types for the `key` parameter which are not always met, resulting in the function not being able to correctly handle the different types of input.

The key type is being incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in each case, and the subsequent operations in the function are not properly handling this type of value.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to refactor the function so that it can correctly handle the different types of input for the `key` parameter and assign the correct type to `key_type`. Additionally, ensure proper handling of the different types of keys based on their inferred type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, np.ndarray, list, pd.Index, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic to handle indexing and reindexing based on the type of the `key` parameter. If the key is of a valid type, it directly returns the result of `self.loc[key]`. Otherwise, it raises a `KeyError`. This approach ensures that the function correctly handles a variety of input types for the `key` parameter.
