The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle certain cases properly, leading to inconsistent behavior when trying to access the Series using different types of indexers. 

Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the issue lies in the handling of different types of indexers, particularly when using a list as an indexer.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling different types of indexers, especially when dealing with a list indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)
    if key_type in ['string', 'floating', 'mixed-integer']:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check if the key is a slice and handle it accordingly.
- Then, we use the `lib.infer_dtype` function to infer the type of the key and directly access the values using `self.loc` for specific types of keys ('string', 'floating', 'mixed-integer').
- For other types of keys, we use `self.reindex` to handle the access.

This should provide a more consistent behavior when accessing the Series using different types of indexers, including the list indexer as encountered in the failing test.
