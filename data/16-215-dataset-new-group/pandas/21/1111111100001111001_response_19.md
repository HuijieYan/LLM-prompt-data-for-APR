The bug is likely caused by the logic for handling different types of keys within the `_get_with` function. The function is designed to handle different types of keys, including lists, tuples, scalars, and indexes, by identifying the key type and then performing the appropriate action. However, the identification logic seems to be flawed, as the key types are not being correctly identified in the runtime executions, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the key type identification logic within the `_get_with` function needs to be revised to accurately identify the type of the key being passed. Additionally, the actions taken based on the identified key type need to be re-evaluated to ensure they align with the expected behavior for each key type.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        key = pd.Index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = pd.Index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "Unsupported key type. Supported types are: slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index"
        )
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional checks to identify scalar key types and re-index the series accordingly. We have also converted keys of type list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index to a Pandas Index object before re-indexing the series. Lastly, we have added a catch-all `else` block to raise a `TypeError` for unsupported key types.

This corrected version aligns with the expected behavior for different key types and should pass all the provided tests.
