The issue is related to the behavior of list indexers and array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` operation for a `Series`. The expected behavior is inconsistent and causes the test to fail, leading to a `KeyError`.

The detected error location is in the section where various types of indexer inputs (`key`) are evaluated, leading to the determination of `key_type`.

The bug is caused by the inconsistency in how list indexers and array-like indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. This causes different behaviors and error messages when accessing the `Series` using these different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently, resulting in the same behavior and error messages.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type in ["floating", "integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that regardless of the type of indexer, it is converted into the appropriate index format using `ensure_index`, and then the `key_type` is determined based on the inferred type of the index. This should lead to consistent behavior and error messages, resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
