The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. When using a list indexer, it generates a KeyError, while for other array-like indexers, it returns the expected result.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will align the behavior for all indexers and resolve the inconsistency issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, ValueError):
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated function, it will handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This fix should resolve the inconsistency issue reported in the GitHub issue.
