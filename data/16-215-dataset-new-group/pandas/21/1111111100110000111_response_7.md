After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, the corresponding error messages, and the GitHub issue, it seems that the issue is related to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the `ser` function.

The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers with the `ser` function. The error occurs because the list indexers are not being handled the same way as other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

To fix this bug, the strategy would be to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers in the `ser` function's `_get_with` method.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCMultiIndex)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "list":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function will handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, preventing the KeyError issue.
