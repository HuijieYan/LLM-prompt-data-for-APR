The bug in the function `_get_with` appears to stem from the incorrect determination of the type of the `key` parameter, leading to incorrect execution paths and resulting in type errors.

The `key` parameter is being incorrectly identified as a string in all cases, when it should be recognized as a list-like or index object, leading to faulty return values.

To address this issue, the function `_get_with` should correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Correctly determine the type of key
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function correctly checks for scalar values using `is_scalar` and handles them appropriately. Additionally, the final `else` block handles any other types of keys by calling `reindex` with the `key`. This ensures that all possible types of `key` are addressed and processed correctly.
