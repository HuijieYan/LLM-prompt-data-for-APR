The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing the issue. The bug is related to the method treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. The error message in the failing test indicates that the KeyError is raised when using `ser[list(key)]`, but not when using other indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, leading to the KeyError when using list indexers. This inconsistency is also mentioned in the GitHub issue where it is suggested that all cases should behave like the list case, and only one test breaks when attempting to make this change.

To fix the bug, the method `_get_with` should be updated to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. It should not raise a KeyError when using list indexers, instead, it should provide the same behavior as array-like indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        # Instead of raising KeyError, return the result of loc
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistent behavior and the KeyError raised when using list indexers.
