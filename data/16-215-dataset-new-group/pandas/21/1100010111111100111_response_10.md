The bug in the _get_with function is related to the handling of different types of indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior for list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This can be observed in the failing test, which expects the same behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers. The error message indicates that the KeyError is raised for the list indexer case, but not for the other three cases.

Analysis of the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function:

Case 1:
- Input: key = ['C'] (list), self.index = RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1), self = Series(['A', 'B'])
- key_type inferred as 'string'

Case 2:
- Input: key = array(['C'], dtype=object), self.index, self same as in Case 1
- key_type inferred as 'string'

Case 3:
- Input: key = Index(['C'], dtype='object'), self.index, self same as in Case 1
- key_type inferred as 'string'

Case 4:
- Input: key = Series(['C'], dtype=object), self.index, self same as in Case 1
- key_type inferred as 'string'

The key_type is consistently inferred as 'string' in all cases, leading to incorrect handling of the indexers.

The bug is causing inconsistent behavior for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, resulting in a KeyError being raised for list indexers when there are no matches in the index.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle different types of indexers in a consistent manner and ensure that the KeyError is raised for all array-like indexers when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if is_object_dtype(key):
        key = key.astype(str)

    if is_integer(key) or is_bool(key) or is_categorical_dtype(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the key is converted to an Index using the ensure_index function. We also handle cases where the key is of object dtype separately, and then update the logic for different types of key to ensure consistent behavior and proper handling of indexers. This should address the inconsistency observed in the failing tests, and the function should now raise a KeyError for all array-like indexers when there are no matches in the index.
