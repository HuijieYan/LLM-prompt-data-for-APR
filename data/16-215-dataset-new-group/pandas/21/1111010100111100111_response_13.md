The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, and it does not handle the case of a list indexer correctly. This behavior is inconsistent with the treatment of other indexers and leads to a KeyError when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index using a list indexer.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the list indexer case in the same way as the other indexers. We can use the `reindex` method to avoid KeyError when accessing a key that does not exist in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
After making this change, the function will handle the list indexer case consistently with other indexers, and it should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
