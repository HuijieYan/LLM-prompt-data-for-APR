## Correction of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            if is_list_like(key):
                # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
                return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, IndexError):
            pass
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the key is checked for its type, and then appropriate actions are taken accordingly. The problem was within the `isinstance(key, list)` condition, which led to inconsistencies. This correction by using `is_list_like` is more robust and eliminates the issue.

This correction ensures that the function behaves consistently for different types of input indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report. It also satisfies the expected input/output values given in the failing test cases.
