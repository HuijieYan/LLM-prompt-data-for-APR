The provided function `_get_with` contains several potential error locations:
1. The condition `if isinstance(key, tuple)` suggests that `key` should be a tuple, but it can be a tuple as well as other types such as a list, numpy array, or a pandas Series. This ambiguity could be a potential cause of the error.
2. The type check `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` checks if `key` is of type DataFrame, but it is expected that it should check for the Index type. This could be the potential cause of the error, as it might not handle the key type correctly leading to the unexpected behavior.

Based on the previous observations, the potential cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` has ambiguous logic for type checking, especially for the `key` variable. This leads to incorrect handling of the key type and results in throwing errors when a specific key type is used, as seen in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the logic for type checking within the `_get_with` function should be revised. The condition checks should be reorganized, and the correct handling of different types of keys should be implemented. Based on the failing test provided, it seems like the key is expected to either be converted to positional or label-based indexing. Therefore, the main strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the type checking and handling of different types of keys are correct in the logic of the `_get_with` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame) or isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the error handling for the type of `key` has been revised to accurately handle different data types. The checks are made more specific to accommodate different variations of the `key` type which would resolve the issue reported by the failing tests.
