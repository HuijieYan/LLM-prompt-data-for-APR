## Correction:

The issue here seems to be related to the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The `ser[key]` operation behaves differently from `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, `ser[np.array(key)]`, and `ser[list(key)]`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

The problem occurs when using the `ser[list(key)]` syntax, which raises a KeyError. To address this, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to address the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index) and not isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        if key.inferred_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
            if key.inferred_type == 'integer' and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key.inferred_type == 'list':
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle all types of indexers consistently and should fix the issue reported on GitHub. The corrected version ensures that list indexers behave the same as other indexers, avoiding the KeyError raised in the failing tests.

This should resolve the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.
