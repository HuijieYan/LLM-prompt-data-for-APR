The bug is caused by incorrect handling of indexing when the key is a list, array, index, or series. The current implementation fails to handle these types of keys and returns a KeyError instead of returning the correct result.

The _get_with function tries to handle multiple scenarios for key values, but it is not implementing the functionality properly. For example, when the key is a list, array, index, or series, the function needs to return the relevant items from the series based on the key, but the current implementation fails to do so.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be refactored to better handle the scenarios when the key is a list, array, index, or series. The function should correctly retrieve the relevant items from the series based on the key and return them as a new series.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

By adding a condition to handle lists and arrays, we can now correctly retrieve the relevant items from the series based on the key values. This revised version should pass the failing tests.
