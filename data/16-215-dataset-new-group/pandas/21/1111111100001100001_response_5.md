The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like object and is instead a scalar. This causes the function to attempt to index the Series using a label-based method, which leads to an error. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic around how the key is interpreted and used for indexing. We can use the `is_list_like` function to check if the key is list-like, and if not, we can convert it into a list before proceeding with the indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key to list

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function will handle scalar keys correctly by converting them into a list before proceeding with the indexing process. This should fix the bug and prevent the errors encountered in the failing test cases.
