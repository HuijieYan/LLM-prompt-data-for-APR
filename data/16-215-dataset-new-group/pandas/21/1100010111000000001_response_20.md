The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` has several issues:
1. The first issue is with the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` condition. If the key is not list-like, it tries to convert it to a scalar and then calls `self.loc[key]`. This could cause issues with non-list-like keys.
2. In the case of `key_type == "integer"`, there is an ambiguous logic for deciding whether to treat the key as positional or label-based.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` expects a KeyError with a specific message when an invalid key is used to index a Series.

To fix the bug, the ambiguous logic for deciding whether to treat the key as positional or label-based should be clarified. Additionally, the handling of non-list-like keys must be improved.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            # boolean indexing
            return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # non-list-like keys, such as scalars
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of `_get_with` checks for list-like keys and non-list-like keys separately and clarifies the logic for deciding between positional or label-based indexing based on the key type. This should resolve the issues and make the function pass the failing test.
