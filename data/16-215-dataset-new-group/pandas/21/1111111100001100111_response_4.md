## Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the Series. However, there are inconsistencies in the handling of indexers, leading to the bug.

In all the runtime cases provided:
- The `key` is a list-like object in some form, and `self.index` is a `RangeIndex` with two elements.
- The `key_type` variable is always assigned a string value, indicating that the function does not correctly infer the type of the input `key`.

The GitHub issue explains a similar inconsistency in the behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically highlighting the inconsistency in how a list indexer is handled compared to array-like indexers. This is consistent with the behavior observed in the runtime cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly infer the type of the input `key` and then handle different types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expectation described in the GitHub issue.

The bugs can be fixed by modifying the logic to infer the type of the `key` correctly and then processing it based on its inferred type.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        inferred_key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if inferred_key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function attempts to infer the type of the `key` and processes it accordingly. This implementation aims to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
