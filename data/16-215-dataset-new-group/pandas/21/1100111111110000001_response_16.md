The error message indicates that the `ser[key]` failed to raise a `KeyError`. The issue is likely to be due to the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. 

The `_get_with` function tries to handle indexing with various data types and performs different actions based on the type of the input `key`. However, there is no explicit condition to handle the case where an iterable object is passed as the `key` argument, potentially leading to an undesired action or error.

To fix the bug, I suggest adding a condition to check if the `key` is a single value or an iterable object. If the `key` is an iterable object, it should be passed to the `reindex` function to ensure proper handling.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)  # Reindex if key is an iterable object
    else:
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported key type or format")
```

This updated version explicitly checks for iterable objects and reindexes using the `reindex` function when `key` is an iterable type. The updated function avoids unexpected behavior and is expected to pass the provided test cases.
