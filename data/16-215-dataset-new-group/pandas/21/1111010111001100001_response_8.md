The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the `key_type` variable. Based on the provided input parameters and the runtime values and types of variables, it appears that the `key_type` is consistently being assigned the value `'string'`. This suggests that the logic to infer the data type of the key is not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for inferring the data type of the key and make sure it correctly identifies the type of key being used (e.g., integer, boolean, string).

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            loc = self.loc[key]
            return loc
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for scalar keys using the `is_scalar` function and handling it separately from other cases such as list, ndarray, Index, etc. We also added a try-except block for handling `KeyError` when using `self.loc[key]`, and then returning `self.reindex(key)` if the key is not found.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
