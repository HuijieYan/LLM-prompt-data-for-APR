## Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function is called `_get_with` and it is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. The function is used to handle indexing operations on a Series object.

The function first checks the type of the key being used for indexing. If the key is a slice, it calls the `_slice` method of the same class. If the key is a DataFrame, it raises a TypeError. If the key is a tuple, it calls the `_get_values_tuple` method of the same class. If the key is not list-like, it falls back to using the `loc` method of the Series object.

The bug occurs when the key is list-like. In this case, the function tries to handle different types of keys (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series), but due to inconsistencies in the handling of different types of keys, the function may raise a KeyError in some cases, as evidenced by the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

## Error Locations and Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of the function when handling list-like keys. The function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and errors in certain cases.

When the key is list-like, the function tries to infer the type of the key and handle it accordingly. However, the handling of different types of keys (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series) is not consistent, leading to errors when trying to index with a list-like key.

The failing tests and the GitHub issue indicate that the bug leads to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior when indexing using list-like keys.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to ensure consistent handling of list-like keys. The function should treat all types of list-like keys (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series) in a consistent manner to avoid errors and inconsistencies in indexing operations.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Treat all list-like keys (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series) consistently
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, all list-like keys are treated consistently by using the `loc` method for indexing. This ensures that the function handles list-like keys in a uniform manner and avoids inconsistencies and errors that were present in the original buggy function. The corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
