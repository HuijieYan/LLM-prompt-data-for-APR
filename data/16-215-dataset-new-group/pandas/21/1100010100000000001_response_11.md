The potential errors in the provided code are as follows:

1. The `ABCDataFrame` check could be incorrect, as the intention might be to check for a pandas DataFrame instead.
2. The logic for handling the different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, etc.) seems to be mixed up or not properly defined.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling different types of `key` inputs, leading to potential issues with indexing the Series.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be restructured to correctly handle the different types of `key` inputs. This could involve revisiting the logic for each type of `key` and handling them appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    # handle DataFrame
    if isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
  
    # handle tuple
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle scalar
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle list, array, ExtensionArray, Series, Index
    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle integer indexer
        if is_integer(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # handle list-like key or reindex the key
            return self.loc[key]

    # handle non-list-like key by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks the type of `key` and then handles it accordingly. It properly differentiates between different types of keys such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list-like, etc., and applies the appropriate logic for each type. It also addresses the specific cases mentioned in the original function.
