The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the pandas package. The error message indicates that the code is not raising an expected `KeyError` when attempting to index a series with another list-like object such as a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or Series.

The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the input key and identifying its type. The function is designed to handle different types of keys, however, it appears that the handling and type checking of the key is inconsistent, leading to the error.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to revisit the conditional blocks for handling different types of keys and ensure that the appropriate type checks are performed. Additionally, handling the case where the key is a list-like object should be revised to properly raise a `KeyError`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # Convert slice into positional or label-based index
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected code includes a conditional check for `is_list_like` and `reindex` when `key` is not recognized as any other supported type. This ensures that the correct operations are performed based on the type of the `key`.
