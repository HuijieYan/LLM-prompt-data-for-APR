The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to how list-like objects are being handled and it is causing a `KeyError` for the failing test cases. The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of list-like objects, leading to the `KeyError` when key is a list of values that are not present in the index of the Series object.

To fix this bug, the key (the input to the function) should be checked for its type and appropriately handled based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not is_list_like(key) and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we correctly handle the different types of keys and appropriately call `self.loc`, `self.iloc`, or `self.reindex` based on the type of the key.

These changes should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
