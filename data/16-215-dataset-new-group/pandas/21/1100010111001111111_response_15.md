The issue with the provided _get_with function is that it is not handling the case of list-based indexers correctly. The GitHub issue reveals that there is inconsistency in the behavior of list-based indexers compared to array-like indexers. The bug causes the function to raise a KeyError when using list-based indexers (e.g., ser[list(key)]).

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-based indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function now checks if the key is an list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index and then calls self.loc[key], resolving the issue of inconsistent behavior with list-based indexers. This change ensures that the function handles list-based indexers in a manner consistent with other types of indexers.
