The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks for different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, booleans, integers, lists, and so on. The error seems to be related to how the function handles list-like key indexers.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series with a list, and it expects to raise a `KeyError` with a specific message, but the function is not raising the exception as expected.

The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior of indexing a Series with list-like indexers is inconsistent with other types of indexers. It highlights that the `list` case raises a `KeyError` with a specific message, while other types of indexers do not raise a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement handling list-like key indexers needs to be modified to ensure that when indexing with a list, a `KeyError` is raised with the expected message.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        key = list(key)
        # Attempting to access a non-existing index should raise a KeyError
        self.loc[key]
    except KeyError as e:
        msg = f"None of {key} are in the index"
        raise KeyError(msg) from e
```

In the corrected version, after converting the key to a list, an attempt is made to access the key using `.loc`. If a `KeyError` is raised during this access, it is caught and re-raised with the expected message. This correction ensures that when indexing with a list, a `KeyError` is raised as expected.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
