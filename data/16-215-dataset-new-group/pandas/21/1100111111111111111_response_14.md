The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing different behaviors for list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This is inconsistent and is causing issues when using `ser[key]` with a list index. The failing test is related to the behavior of the function when indexing with a list, array, or index.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers correctly, which leads to a KeyError when attempting to index with a list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list if it's not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that any type of indexer, whether it's a list, array, index, or other data structure, will be handled in a consistent manner. This should resolve the issue and make the function's behavior more predictable and uniform.
