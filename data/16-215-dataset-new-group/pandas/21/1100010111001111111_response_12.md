The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to handling different types of indexers. The issue on GitHub provides insight into the problem and the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers such as list, array, and Index. 

The bug seems to be causing inconsistent behavior when using list-type indexers, leading to a KeyError in some cases, as described in the failing test. The expected behavior is for all types of indexers to behave consistently and not raise a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that they do not raise a KeyError and providing the expected behavior for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
```

In the corrected version, all types of indexers are handled consistently, and the logic for handling integer type indexers and reindexing is adjusted to provide the expected behavior without raising a KeyError.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
