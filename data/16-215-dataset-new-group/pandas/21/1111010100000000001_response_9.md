The buggy function `_get_with` is aimed to get the data from a Series based on the provided key. The potential error locations within this function could be:
1. The handling of the `key` input to determine its type and perform the corresponding action.
2. The use of conditional statements to check the type and perform actions based on the type of the `key`.

The cause of the bug could be a mismatch in handling different types of the `key` input, leading to incorrect results or errors.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to streamline the handling of different types of the `key` input and ensure that the correct actions are performed based on the type of the `key`.

Here's a corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handling slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    # raise error when key is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    # handling tuple to get values
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    # handle cases for non-list like and not recognized scalars
    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    # handling list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index types of keys
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        is_int_indexer = ensure_platform_int(key)
        if is_scalar(is_int_indexer):
            if not is_bool(key):
                indexer = self.loc[key].index
                if is_categorical_dtype(indexer):
                    raise InvalidIndexError("Cannot use '.loc[]' with a non-unique index.")
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                if not is_object_dtype(indexer):
                    raise KeyError(key)
                indexer = self.index
                if is_categorical_dtype(indexer):
                    raise InvalidIndexError("Cannot use `.iloc[]` with a non-integer key.")
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, the input `key` is handled based on its type, and the corresponding actions are performed to retrieve the data from the Series. The function now ensures that the correct indexing method (`.loc[]` or `.iloc[]`) is used based on the type of the `key`. Additionally, proper error handling for different types of keys is implemented to prevent unexpected behaviors.
