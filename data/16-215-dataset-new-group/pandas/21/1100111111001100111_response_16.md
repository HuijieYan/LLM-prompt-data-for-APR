The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where `key` is a list-like object correctly, leading to inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of the list-like object `key` in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list-like object, the function should handle it consistently, but currently, it does not. This inconsistency causes different behaviors depending on the type of indexers used, leading to failing tests and the reported GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles the list-like object `key` consistently by updating the conditional logic and index handling for list-like objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):  # Use is_list_like to handle all list-like objects consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function now handles list-like objects consistently, addressing the inconsistency in behavior reported in the GitHub issue. This should also pass the failing test.
