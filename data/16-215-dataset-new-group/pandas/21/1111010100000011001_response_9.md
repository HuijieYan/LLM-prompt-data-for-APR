In the given buggy function, the issue appears to be with the handling of the key parameter. The function seems to determine the type of the key and then take different actions based on the type. However, there are several potential issues with the implementation, such as not correctly handling certain types of keys, not handling all possible cases, and potential type mismatch errors.

One potential source of the bug could be the way the function is determining the type of the key. It uses `lib.infer_dtype()` to infer the type, but this may not cover all possible cases.

Another potential source of the bug could be the way the function handles different types of keys. The function uses various checks to determine the type of the key and then takes different actions based on the type. However, these checks may not cover all possible cases or may lead to type mismatch errors.

To fix the bug, we can revise the function to correctly determine the type of the key and handle all possible cases in a consistent and robust manner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = 'other'

    if key_type in ['integer', 'other']:
        indexer = ensure_index(key)
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[indexer]
        else:
            return self.loc[indexer]
    else:
        return self.reindex(indexer)
```
In this corrected version, we first handle the slice, DataFrame, and tuple cases as before. Then we ensure that the key is converted to an index if it is not list-like or a specific type of index. Next, we determine the type of the index and handle the integer and other cases similarly, using the `iloc` and `loc` accessors depending on the index type. Finally, for other types of indices, we reindex the series appropriately. This should address the potential issues with type inference and handling different types of keys in a consistent and robust manner.
