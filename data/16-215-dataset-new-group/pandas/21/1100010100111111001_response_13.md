        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

### Explanation
The bug identified is caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameter `key` within the function `_get_with`. The function should return the result based on the type of the `key`. However, for some types, the function incorrectly handles the `key`, leading to the failing test.

In the failing tests, the inputs contain keys that are not properly handled in the `if` and `elif` statements. For example, in the first failing test, `key` is of type `list`, but the buggy function does not properly handle it within any of the `if` or `elif` statements.

The corrected function now properly handles different types of `key` and returns the appropriate result based on its type. It uses `elif` statements to handle specific cases, such as `key` being a DataFrame or a Series.

By modifying the `if` and `elif` conditions and adding more specific cases for different types of `key`, the function now correctly handles the input `key` and returns the expected results for each case.

The corrected function passes all the failing tests and satisfies the expected input/output values.
