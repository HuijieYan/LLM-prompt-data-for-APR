The buggy function `_get_with` has a few potential error locations:
1. The handling of different types of indexers may cause inconsistencies in behavior.
2. The error message raised when using a list indexer may not be accurate.

The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, leading to a KeyError when using a list indexer. This inconsistency does not align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that the error messages are accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function now handles list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index indexers consistently, and it falls back to reindexing for any other types of indexers. This approach ensures that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers and should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
