The issue is related to how different types of indexers are treated inconsistently within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, the issue arises when using a list indexer, where the behavior differs from other array-like indexers, leading to a `KeyError` in some cases.

The cause of the bug can be traced back to the conditional checks within the `_get_with` function. When the function encounters a list-like key, it does not handle it correctly, resulting in the `KeyError` exception.

To fix the bug, one strategy is to handle list-like keys in a similar manner to other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional checks and the corresponding logic for list-like keys within the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys in a similar manner to other array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should handle list-like keys more consistently with array-like indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing test case.
