The issue is related to the inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers when used with a Series object. The `__getitem__` operation behaves differently for list indexers compared to array-like indexers, causing inconsistency and raising KeyError in certain cases.

After analyzing the buggy function and the associated class documentation, it appears that the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of list indexers. The bug may be causing inconsistencies in the behavior of the function when different types of indexers are used, leading to unexpected KeyError.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve revisiting the logic for handling different types of indexers, specifically for list-like indexers. The behavior should be made consistent across different types of indexers to ensure that the function returns the expected results without raising KeyErrors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # handle scalars separately
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError("Key not found in index")

    # handle other types of indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we have explicitly handled the case of non-list-like indexers by checking for scalar values and handling them separately. For list-like indexers, we directly use `self.loc[key]` to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This approach aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, addressing the inconsistency and potential KeyError raised due to list indexers.

By making these changes, the corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
