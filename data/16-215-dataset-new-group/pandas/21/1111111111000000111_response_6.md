Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The conditions checking for the type of the key might not be handling certain cases correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.
2. The implementation may not be consistent with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when using a list-like key to index a Series. The behavior is inconsistent compared to using other types of indexers. The bug is related to how the function handles different types of indexers and the error message raised.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of the function is consistent across different types of indexers when used to index a Series. This consistency should align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue. This may involve modifying the conditions for checking the type of the key and updating the error message to be consistent with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer type")

# Updated condition for handling different types of indexers
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles different types of indexers and raises a consistent error message if encountering an unsupported indexer type. This aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
