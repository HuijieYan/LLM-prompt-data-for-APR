The potential error location in the function is within the condition checks for different types of indexers such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list scalar, and array-like object.

The bug is caused by the inconsistency in the behavior of indexers such as list, array-like, and DataFrame when used to index a Series. The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class does not handle the case of a list indexer properly, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle the list indexer case properly and ensure consistency in behavior for different types of indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the condition checks and the corresponding handling logic for each type of indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to resolve the issue:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of the list indexer is explicitly added after the check for non-list scalars and before the generic handling of array-like indexers. This ensures that the behavior is consistent for list indexers and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
