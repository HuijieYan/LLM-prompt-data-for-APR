The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file has multiple issues. Let's analyze the potential error locations within the function and its relationship with the failing test.

1. The function is attempting to handle different types of keys and their behavior, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, non-list-like values, lists, indices, and others.

2. The function tries to identify the type of key and perform various operations based on the type. The potential error locations are where the function mistakenly checks the type of key and chooses an incorrect code path based on that type.

3. The function is failing to handle the key correctly when it is of type `Index`. This leads to a KeyError in the test case when `ser[key]` is executed.

4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to properly handle the different types of keys and implement the necessary operations based on the type.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if getattr(key, "is_all_dates", False) or lib.infer_dtype(key) == "datetime64":
        return self.loc[key]

    if lib.is_scalar(key):
        if is_bool(key) and (is_categorical_dtype(self.dtype) or self.index.equals(properties.RangeIndex(None))):
            return self._get_values_tuple((key,))
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        # boolean values
        return self._get_values_tuple((key,))

    if is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added several checks and conversions to ensure that the key is handled correctly for various data types. By ensuring the key is an index and handling different cases based on the type of index, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
