The bug in the function `_get_with` is related to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically between list indexers and array-like indexers. This inconsistency is causing unexpected behavior and a KeyError to be raised in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the function include the handling of different types of keys and the decision-making process to treat the indexer as positional or label-based.

The cause of the bug is that list indexers are handled differently than array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when using `ser.loc[key]` or `ser.reindex(key)`.

To fix the bug, we can standardize the handling of different types of indexers and ensure that the behavior is consistent across all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_categorical_dtype(self.index):
        indexer = ensure_platform_int(key)
        return self._get_values(indexer)  # fallback to positional indexer

    if is_dict_like(self.index):
        try:
            result = self.index.get_value(self, key)
            if not is_scalar(result):
                return result
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the index") from e

    return self._get_values(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have implemented a consistent handling of indexers by first checking if the key is an array-like type, and if not, then we handle it as a list or other type of indexer using appropriate methods such as `reindex`, `loc`, or `_get_values`.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report by ensuring consistent behavior across all types of indexers.
