The bug seems to be related to the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The failing test is `test_getitem_no_matches` from the file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`, which is testing different types of indexing, including lists, and expects a `KeyError` to be raised. When the `ser[key]` line is executed with a `pandas.core.series.Series` as the key, it does not raise `KeyError` as expected, hence the test fails.

A potential error location within the `_get_with` function is the part where it checks if `key` is a `list` or a `Series`, and based on that, it performs different actions.

The cause of the bug seems to be that when the `key` is a `pandas.core.series.Series` object, the function does not handle it properly and is unable to raise `KeyError` as expected by the test case.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the conditional block that checks the type of `key` and its handling. Since the failing test specifically expects `KeyError` to be raised when a `Series` is passed as the key, the fix should involve ensuring that a `KeyError` is raised in such cases.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking for `Series` explicitly and using `ensure_index()` for it, the corrected version should now raise a `KeyError` as expected by the test case. This fix ensures that all different types of keys are handled properly and consistently.
