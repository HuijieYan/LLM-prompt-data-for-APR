The bug arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas` library. The failing test cases demonstrate that while using a list indexer leads to a `KeyError`, using other types of indexers does not.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional checks for the type of indexer within the `_get_with` function. When a list-like indexer is encountered, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to the `KeyError` in the failing test case.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically focusing on correctly processing list-like indexers so that they do not result in a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not self.index.is_unique or not self.index.is_monotonic_increasing:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if check_key():
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks have been revised to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, including list-like indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and the `KeyError` that was observed in the failing test cases.
