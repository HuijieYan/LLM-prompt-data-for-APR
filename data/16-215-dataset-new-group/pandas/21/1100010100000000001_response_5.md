## Analyze the buggy function:
The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys and return the appropriate values from the Series.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conditional checks using `isinstance` may not be correctly identifying the type of the `key`.
2. If the key is not recognized as a list-like object, it falls back to using `self.loc[key]` without proper handling.
3. There is a mix of logic to handle different types of keys, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The buggy function fails to properly handle all the different types of keys. This may result in incorrect indexing or unexpected errors when accessing values from the Series.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use explicit type checking for different key types to ensure the correct handling.
2. Provide more specific handling for non-list-like keys to avoid falling back to `self.loc[key]` inappropriately.
3. Refactor the code to have a clear path for handling each type of key without overlapping conditions.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        # Handle scalar values which are not recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version:
- The `isinstance` checks are replaced with specific checks using functions like `is_scalar`, `is_bool`, `is_integer`, and `is_list_like` to ensure proper type identification.
- The handling of non-list-like, non-scalar keys is made more specific to avoid unexpected behavior.
- The logic is refactored to have a clear path for handling each type of key without overlapping conditions.
