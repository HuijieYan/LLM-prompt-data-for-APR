To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers. The error message suggests that the issue arises when using a list indexer, which should behave consistently with other indexers such as array-like or Index-like indexers.

The problem arises from the handling of the list indexer within the `_get_with` function. We need to ensure that the behavior of the list indexer is consistent with other indexers, specifically array-like or Index-like indexers.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the handling of the list indexer to align its behavior with other indexers, such as array-like or Index-like indexers. This can be achieved by updating the conditional statements and the corresponding logic for handling the different types of indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a specific condition to handle list indexers and ensured that it aligns with the behavior of other indexers. Additionally, we used the `ensure_index` function to handle the list-like indexer and converted it to an Index, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

This corrected version should resolve the inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers and pass the failing test.
