The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has a bug that leads to inconsistent behavior with different types of indexers. The function does not properly handle different types of indexers, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

The bug occurs when the function encounters key types that are not recognized or handled properly, causing it to return the wrong value or raise an error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle different types of key inputs and ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we use `ensure_index` to handle different types of key inputs and ensure consistent behavior.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
