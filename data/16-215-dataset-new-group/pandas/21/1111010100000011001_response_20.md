The buggy function `_get_with` seems to intend to return values based on the type of the key parameter. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may cause it to fail.

The first potential error location is when checking if the key is a slice. It's possible that the _convert_slice_indexer method is not correctly determining if the slice is positional or label-based.

The second potential error location is when checking if the key is a DataFrame. It raises a TypeError if this is the case, but it's not clear if this is the intended behavior.

Another potential error location is when the key is not list-like. The function is using the `loc` method to return values, but it's possible that this method may not handle all types of scalar values correctly.

The function also checks for various types of keys, such as tuples, Index, and lists, and returns different values based on the type of the key. It's possible that these checks may not cover all possible cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored to handle each type of key input more explicitly and ensure that the correct types are being handled with the appropriate methods.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Handling different types of keys explicitly
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # Assuming 'string' as the default key type
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handling non-list-like keys
        return self.loc[key]
```
This corrected version explicitly handles different types of keys and ensures that the correct methods are used based on the key type. It also provides a default behavior for when the key type is not recognized.

Please note that the corrected version makes assumptions about the default key type (e.g., assuming 'string' as the default). You may need to adjust the default behavior based on the specific requirements of the function.
