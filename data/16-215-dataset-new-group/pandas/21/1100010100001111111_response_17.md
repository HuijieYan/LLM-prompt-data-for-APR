The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when the key is a list. The code first checks if the key is not list-like, and if it isn't, it tries to access `self.loc[key]`. This leads to inconsistent behavior and a potential KeyError when the key is a list.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to remove the check for non-list-like keys and always handle the key as a list when it's an array-like type. Additionally, the code should handle the case where the key is an Index separately to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function first checks for specific types of `key` and then proceeds to access the elements using `self.loc[key]` or `self.reindex(key)` based on the type. This ensures consistent behavior for different types of keys and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
