The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it does not handle the case when the key is a list-like object correctly. When the key is a list-like object, it should be handled by the `self.loc` method, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for handling list-like keys inside the `_get_with` function so that it correctly uses the `self.loc` method to retrieve the values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the case when the key is a list-like object and use the `self.loc` method to retrieve the values, which should make the failing test cases pass and satisfy the expected input/output values.
