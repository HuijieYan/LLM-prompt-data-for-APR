The issue seems to relate to the inconsistent behavior of the `ser` and `key` within the test function when using different indexers. The test expects the behavior to be consistent across different indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`).

The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to handling the indexer `key` when it is a list. The issue arises when using the `ser[key]` syntax and passing a list as the indexer, which results in inconsistent behavior.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the list indexer in the `_get_with` function, leading to an inconsistency when accessing the series using different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior when accessing the series using different indexers. We should specifically address the handling of list indexers in the function.


Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list)):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or list is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or position-based indexing"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we have added a check for `list` specifically and raised a `TypeError` to notify the user that indexing a Series with a list is not supported, instead recommending the use of appropriate DataFrame column or position-based indexing.

This corrected version should provide consistent behavior across different indexers and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
