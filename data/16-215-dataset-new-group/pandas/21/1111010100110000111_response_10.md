The main issue here is that the buggy function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently than array-like indexers, which is causing an inconsistent behavior when accessing the Series with these different types of indexers. This discrepancy is leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions when using list indexers.

The cause of the bug is due to the fact that the `_get_with` function doesn't handle the list indexers (e.g., Python list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, and pd.Series) in a consistent manner. This inconsistency leads to different behaviors depending on the type of the indexer, causing the KeyError exceptions.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_get_with` function treats all types of indexers (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, and pd.Series) consistently when accessing the Series. 

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = ensure_index(self.index)._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
```

In this corrected version, we are using `ensure_index` to ensure that the index is consistently handled regardless of its type. This should resolve the inconsistency in behavior when accessing the Series with different types of indexers.
