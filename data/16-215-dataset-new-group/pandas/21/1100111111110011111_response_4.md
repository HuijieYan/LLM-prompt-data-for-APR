The root cause of the bug is that the `key` parameter is being passed as a list, and the function is treating it differently based on its type. Specifically, when `key` is a list, the function is using `reindex(key)`, which is causing the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for `isinstance(key, list)` and use `self.loc[key]` when `key` is a list.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
