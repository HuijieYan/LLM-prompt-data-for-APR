## Bug analysis
The `_get_with` function has an issue with the logic for determining the type of key and handling different types of keys. It seems that the `key_type` variable is being incorrectly assigned, and this is causing the function to return the wrong value in some cases.

The function is intended to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, and Index objects. It should determine the type of the key and then perform the appropriate operation based on that type.

Based on the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the `key_type` variable is always being assigned the value 'string', regardless of the actual type of the key.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key and perform the appropriate operation based on that type. This involves debugging the process of assigning the `key_type` variable and ensuring that the correct path is taken based on the type of the key.

## The corrected function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Assign proper key type
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            key_type = "boolean"
        else:
            key_type = "other"

    # Perform operation based on key type
    if key_type == "other":
        return self.reindex(ensure_index(key))
    elif key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
``` 

In the corrected version, I made changes to assign the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` input. Then, the function performs the appropriate operation based on the assigned `key_type`. I also ensured that the correct path is taken based on the type of the key, which should address the bug.
