After analyzing the buggy function, we can see that the issue appears to be in the `_get_with` function. The code is attempting to call the `reindex` method, but it might not be getting executed properly. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is attempting to index a Series `ser` with a key `key`, and it's expecting a `KeyError` with a specific message. However, the current implementation of `_get_with` does not handle the `key` correctly, resulting in the failure of the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function so that it properly handles the different types of keys, including a `Series` key and an `Index` key. We can modify the branching conditions to make sure that the key is handled correctly based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The changes made include checking whether the key is a scalar and whether it is present in the index. If not, it raises a KeyError with the appropriate message.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test, `test_getitem_no_matches`.
