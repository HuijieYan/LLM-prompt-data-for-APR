The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the identification of the `key_type` variable. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` parameter, resulting in the wrong path being taken in the subsequent if-else statements.

The problem is likely caused by the way the function is determining the `key_type` variable, which is essential for the conditional statements that follow. The incorrect identification of the `key_type` is leading to the wrong code paths being executed, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined based on the type of the `key` parameter. We can achieve this by using appropriate methods to check the type of the `key` and then set the `key_type` accordingly. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of keys should be reviewed and updated as necessary.

Below, you'll find the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        key = list(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the case when key is an Index
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # handle the case when key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using the appropriate methods to check the type of the `key` and setting the `key_type` accordingly, we ensure that the function takes the correct code paths based on the type of the `key` parameter. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected for different input scenarios.
