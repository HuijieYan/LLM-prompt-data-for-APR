The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the different treatment of list indexers and other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistency and unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional statements that handle list indexers and ensuring they behave in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, we ensure that list indexers are treated in the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency and unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
