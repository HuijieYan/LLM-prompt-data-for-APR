The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module. The bug causes an inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when used with the `Series` class.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the handling of list-like input `key` in the `_get_with` function. The function does not handle a list-like input `key` correctly and raises a `KeyError` when attempting to index the `Series` with a list. This inconsistency in behavior is not aligned with the expected behavior for array-like indexers, leading to failing tests in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` module.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle list-like input as it should. Instead of treating the list as an array-like indexer, it incorrectly tries to index the Series with the list, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to correctly handle list-like input `key` and treat it as an array-like indexer rather than trying to directly index the Series with the list. This will ensure consistent behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers.

The corrected version of the function should properly validate and process list-like input to retrieve the appropriate values from the Series.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the first conditional statement checks if the `key` is list-like. If it is, the function uses `self.loc` to retrieve the appropriate values from the Series. This adjustment ensures consistent behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior across different types of indexers.
