The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the inconsistency in how different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) are handled. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` specifically demonstrates the issue by showing that the behavior of indexing with `list` is different from indexing with other array-like structures.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle all types of indexers consistently. The function should recognize and process different types of indexers such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` in the same way. This will align the behavior of the function with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This modified version of the function treats all types of indexers consistently, which aligns with the expected behavior discussed in the GitHub issue. After making this change, the failing test should pass, resolving the issue.
