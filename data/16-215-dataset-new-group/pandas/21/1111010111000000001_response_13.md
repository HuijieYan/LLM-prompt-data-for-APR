The bug in this function is caused by incorrect logic for handling different types of input keys. The issue is with the conditional checks and error handling. The current implementation raises a KeyError due to mismatched indices when a certain type of key is used.

The strategy to fix the bug is to re-implement how different types of keys are handled and to ensure that the correct TypeErrors are raised when inappropriate key types are used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"The key {key} is not in the index") from e
```

In this corrected version, we handle various key types using a try-except block to catch KeyError and re-raise it with a more informative message. Then, we can use this corrected function to run the failing test and verify that it passes.
