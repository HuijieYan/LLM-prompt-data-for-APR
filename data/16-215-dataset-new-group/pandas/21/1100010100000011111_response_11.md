The buggy function `_get_with` has multiple potential error points, including the conditional logic that checks the type of the `key` parameter and the conversion of the key to a list in the later part of the function. The primary cause of the bug is the inconsistent behavior when dealing with different types of indexers, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when handling different types of indexers. This would involve revisiting the conditional logic and the conversion of the key to a list, aligning the behavior with the expected output described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction ensures that the function handles different types of indexers consistently and follows the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
