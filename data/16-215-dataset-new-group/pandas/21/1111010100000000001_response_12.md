The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys and perform the appropriate operation on the Series object. The function checks the type of the key and then attempts to process it accordingly. However, there are a few potential issues in the function that need to be fixed.

1. The function does not properly handle the case of a DataFrame key. It raises a TypeError when it encounters a DataFrame key, which is not the intended behavior.

2. The function does not handle the case where the key is a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. This leads to potential issues with indexing when `key` is not list-like.

3. There are some redundant checks and a lack of consistency in the handling of different key types.

To fix these issues, the following corrected version of the function can be used:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        # Raise a more descriptive error message
        raise TypeError(
            f"Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column. "
            f"Key provided: {type(key)}"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        # Handle scalar keys by converting to a list
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list or array
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now handles the DataFrame key case with a more descriptive error message, handles scalar keys by converting them to a list, and has a more consistent approach to handling different key types.
