The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the `key_type` variable, which is being determined incorrectly based on the input `key`. The failing tests are indicating that the function is not correctly handling the input types, leading to a KeyError. 

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correctly determining the type of the `key` input to choose the appropriate method for indexing the Series. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the `key` is not found in the Series index by raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # check if key is not found in the index
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we first handle the cases of `slice`, `pd.DataFrame`, and `tuple` inputs as before. Then we check if the `key` is not found in the Series index and raise a KeyError if that's the case. Finally, we return the value corresponding to the `key` using the `loc` accessor.
