The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the key parameter, particularly when the key is passed as an instance of `pd.Series` or `pd.Index`. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to access the data with the provided key.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional handling of different key types to correctly handle `pd.Series` and `pd.Index` instances when used as the key parameter. We also need to ensure that the key provided is correctly used to access the data in the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # array-like, may include pd.Series and pd.Index instances
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key.is_boolean():
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key.is_extension_array_dtype:
        key = key.to_numpy()
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key` parameter is first converted to an Index using the `ensure_index` function to ensure a consistent and compatible input type for indexing. Then, the behavior for different key types is handled, including boolean type, integer type, and extension array type. Also, the condition for dealing with array-like key types has been modified to be more comprehensive.

By ensuring consistent handling for different key types and indexing methods, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
