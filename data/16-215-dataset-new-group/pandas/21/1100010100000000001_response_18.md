## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, including incorrect type checks and incorrect handling of different types of indexers.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The `if` condition for checking if `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame` is incorrect and should be replaced with a condition for checking if `key` is an instance of `DataFrame`.
2. The condition for checking if `key` is a list-like object is incorrect and could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. There are multiple inconsistent checks for the type of `key`, which could lead to incorrect result handling.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is caused by incorrect type checks and inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when a Series is indexed using different types of keys.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the type checks for different types of keys to ensure correct handling of indexers.
2. Resolve the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers to provide consistent behavior for indexing a Series.

## Fixing the bug:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):  # Fix: Replace ABCDataFrame with DataFrame
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):  # Fix: Use is_list_like to check if key is list-like
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = key.tolist()

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":  # Fix: Add condition to handle boolean type
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the type checks for different types of keys are updated to ensure consistent and correct handling. Additionally, the function now properly handles different types of indexers and provides consistent behavior for indexing a Series.
