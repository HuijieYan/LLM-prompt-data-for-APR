The issue seems to be related to the different behavior of the function when the input is a list compared to when it is an array-like indexer. The expected behavior is that all cases should behave consistently and raise a KeyError when there are no matches in the index.

The bug seems to be in how the function handles the input key, especially when it is a list. The inconsistent behavior occurs when the function handles different types of indexers such as a list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle all types of indexers in a consistent way, ensuring that a KeyError is raised when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame, Index, or ExtensionArray is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate column property"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle all types of indexers consistently and raise a KeyError when there are no matches in the index. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass all the failing test cases.
