The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers, which results in inconsistent behavior. This is in violation of the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers the same way it handles other array-like indexers, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access values from the Series using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional statements and logic to treat the list indexer the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
