The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it doesn't handle the case when a list-like key with no matches is passed to the Series. The function incorrectly raises a `KeyError` instead of handling this case gracefully. This is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are treated.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case of a list-like key with no matches and ensure it behaves consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the case of a list-like key with no matches
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError as e:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            # handle the dup indexing case
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise e
```

In this corrected version, we added a `try/except` block to catch the `KeyError` that may be raised when trying to access the key. If the key is a list or other array-like type, we handle the exception by returning `self.loc[key]`, ensuring consistency with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue and handle the case mentioned in the failing test, ensuring consistent behavior for array-like indexers.
