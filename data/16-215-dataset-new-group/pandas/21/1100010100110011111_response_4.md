The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, there are inconsistencies in how it handles different indexers, as indicated by the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. Handling `list` indexers differently from other types of indexers.
2. Inconsistencies in returning values based on the type of indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle different types of indexers consistently, leading to unexpected behaviors and error messages.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to standardize the handling of different types of indexers within the function, ensuring consistent behavior and error handling for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `key` is converted to an `Index` using `ensure_index` to handle different types of indexers consistently. This should resolve the inconsistencies and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.
