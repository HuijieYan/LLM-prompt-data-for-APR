The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and a KeyError when trying to access elements using a list indexer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all indexers (list, array-like, Index, and Series) behave consistently and do not raise KeyErrors when accessing elements in the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Index."
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to a list for consistent handling
    key = list(key)
    
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers (list, array-like, Index, and Series) behave consistently and do not raise KeyErrors. This will resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensure the expected behavior for accessing elements in a Series using different types of indexers.
