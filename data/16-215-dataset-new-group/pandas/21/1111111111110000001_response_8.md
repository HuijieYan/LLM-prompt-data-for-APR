The bug is caused by the fact that `ser[key]` doesn't raise the expected `KeyError` in the failing test. The issue likely resides in the function `_get_with` within the `Series` class. 

The source of the error could be in multiple conditional statements within the `_get_with` function. One possibility is that the conditional statements for handling `key` conversion are not checking properly for the various types of `key` data. 

Another possibility is that there may be a type casting issue with `key` before being passed to the `reindex` function. This can result in an unexpected behavior and the failure of the test case. 

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional statements within the `_get_with` function to handle the various types of `key` data appropriately. Additionally, ensure proper handling of the `key` type before passing it to the `reindex` function. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        if is_boolean(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex([key])

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

The above updated function handles different types of `key` appropriately and ensures that it is being passed to the `reindex` function with the correct type. This should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
