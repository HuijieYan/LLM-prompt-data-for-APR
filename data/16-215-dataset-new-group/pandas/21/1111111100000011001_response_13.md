The issue with the provided function is the incorrect handling of the key_type variable. It is not being assigned a value before being used, which may lead to unexpected behavior and errors. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type variable is assigned a proper value based on the type of the key parameter before it is used in the function. Additionally, if key is not recognized as a valid type, it should be converted to a list before proceeding with reindexing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list if it is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Check if key_type == "integer" and handle accordingly
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we have added a check to convert the key to a list if it is not list-like before proceeding with further operations. We also assign the proper value to the key_type based on the type of the key parameter. This ensures that the correct type is used for further operations in the function, avoiding any unexpected errors.
