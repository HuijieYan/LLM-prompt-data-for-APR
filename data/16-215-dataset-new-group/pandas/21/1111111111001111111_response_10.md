Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to different behaviors and errors when accessing elements using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including lists, array-like indexers, and Index objects, when accessing elements in the `Series` class. Additionally, the expected behavior should align with the behavior of list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if not is_scalar(key):
            key = [key]
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and aligns with the expected behavior of list indexers when accessing elements in the `Series` class. By ensuring that all indexers are treated similarly, the bug is fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
