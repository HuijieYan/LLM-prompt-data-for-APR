Based on the failing tests and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the determination of the `key_type`. The buggy function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key`, resulting in incorrect behavior and failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and handle each type appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # If `key` is a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series or Index
    if (isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))
            or isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)):
        key_type = "other"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "other":
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrections made in the code include ensuring that the `key` is correctly identified as a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, or ABCDataFrame and the use of the appropriate conditional blocks for each type. This should address the issues identified in the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
