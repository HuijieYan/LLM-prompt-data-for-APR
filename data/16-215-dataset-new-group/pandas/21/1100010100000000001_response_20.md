The cause of the bug in the function is that the logic for handling different types of keys is not properly implemented. The function is trying to handle different input types like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, and arrays, but the logic is not consistent and may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the function to handle different types of keys in a more structured and consistent way.
2. Use proper conditional checks and type-specific handling for different key types to ensure that the function behaves as intended for each input type.
3. Make sure to handle potential edge cases and unexpected input types to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")

```
