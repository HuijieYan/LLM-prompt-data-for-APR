The problem with the `_get_with` function is that it tries to handle different types of key inputs, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list-like scalars, and defaulting to reindex for the last case. However, the implementation of the different condition checks and branching logic is causing unexpected behavior, possibly leading to incorrect results and issues with the key handling.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to systematically handle each type of key input in a clear and unambiguous manner. This can be achieved by restructuring the conditional statements, ensuring each possible input type is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_list(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional checks are organized in a more straightforward manner, ensuring that each type of key input is handled appropriately. The function now prioritizes specific types of keys and handles the remaining types uniformly. Additionally, the handling of non-list-like and non-list key inputs has been improved to avoid unintended behavior.
