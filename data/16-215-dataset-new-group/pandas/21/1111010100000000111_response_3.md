The buggy function `_get_with` from the `Series` class in the pandas module is causing inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers, as reported in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The cause of the bug is due to the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. Specifically, when using a list indexer, the function raises a KeyError, while it does not do so with other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should handle all types of indexers consistently and not raise a KeyError when using a list indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers without raising KeyError
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles all types of indexers, including list indexers, without raising a KeyError. This should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
