The potential error location within the buggy function is in the section where different types of indexers are handled. The bug seems to occur when dealing with a list as an indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like objects as indexers properly, causing an inconsistency in how indexers are treated.

To fix the bug, we can modify the handling of list-like indexers to ensure that they behave consistently with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by updating the logic for processing list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the logic for list-like indexers in the `elif not is_list_like(key)` branch, we ensure that the function handles list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
