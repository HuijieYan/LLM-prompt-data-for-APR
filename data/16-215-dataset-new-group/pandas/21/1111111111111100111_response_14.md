To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers.

Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to how the `_get_with` function handles different types of indexers (e.g., list, array, index) and the inconsistency in the behavior of `ser[key]` when `key` does not match any values in the index.

The issue description points out that the behavior of `ser[pd.Index(key)]` and `ser[np.array(key)]` is inconsistent with `ser[list(key)]`. The latter raises a KeyError, while the former cases return NaN values. Additionally, the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` raises for all 4 cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle these cases consistently, ensuring that it behaves the same way for list indexers and array-like indexers. We will also need to consider the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` and ensure consistency across all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers and array-like indexers consistently
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return np.nan
```

In this corrected version, we have added a try-except block to handle KeyError exceptions consistently for both list and array-like indexers. If a KeyError is raised, the function will return `np.nan`.

This should resolve the inconsistency and ensure that the behavior of `_get_with` is consistent across all types of indexers.

Please note that the corrected version assumes that the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` returning NaN for non-matching values is acceptable. If not, the logic inside the try-except block can be modified accordingly.
