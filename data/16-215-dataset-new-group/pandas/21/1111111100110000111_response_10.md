To fix the bug, we need to address the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. Currently, the behavior is different between using `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]`, which results in a KeyError in the latter case.

To correct this, we need to update the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This will ensure consistency in behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    try:
        # Attempt to reindex the Series with the given key, handling list-like key
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This updated function includes a try-except block to catch KeyErrors that may occur when attempting to reindex the Series with the given key. If a KeyError is raised, it will be re-raised with a message indicating that none of the keys are in the index, providing consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

With this correction, the function should handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the reported issue.
