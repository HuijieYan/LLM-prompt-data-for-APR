The issue mentioned on GitHub points out inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers in a Pandas Series. The specific problem is related to the handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, and the discrepancy when using `ser.loc[key]` for different types of indexers.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the `self.reindex(key)` function within the `_get_with` method might be the source of the bug. It appears that the key type is inferred as a string in all the test cases, which is likely causing issues with reindexing.

To address the bug, the `self.reindex(key)` line should be modified to handle different types of indexers consistently. It's also necessary to ensure that the key type inference accurately reflects the input data type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is a list-like or scalar, and handle it accordingly
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Differentiate between cases based on the inferred key type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is inferred based on the data type of the input key. It then determines the approach for indexing based on the inferred type. By handling different key types consistently and adjusting the reindexing process, this fix should address the issues raised in the failing test cases.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
