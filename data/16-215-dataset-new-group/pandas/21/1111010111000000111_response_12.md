The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas` library is not handling the case of a list indexer properly, leading to inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError being raised for the list case while not for other array-like cases.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers correctly, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access a non-existent key in the index.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the key is converted to an Index using `ensure_index`, which handles list-like keys properly. It provides consistent behavior for list indexers as well as other array-like indexers.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
