Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue arises from the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The function fails to handle list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError in certain cases. The GitHub issue also mentions the inconsistency in the behavior of different indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and other array-like indexers. We should address this inconsistency and ensure that the function correctly handles list indexers to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        key = list(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we address the inconsistency by ensuring consistent handling of list indexers and other array-like indexers. Additionally, we have modified the handling of list indexers to prevent the KeyError issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
