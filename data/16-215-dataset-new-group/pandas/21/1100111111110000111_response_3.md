### Analysis
The `get_with` function tries to handle different types of key inputs, including slices, data frames, and tuples. However, it fails to handle the case when a list-like input is passed, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised.

### Bug Location
The bug is most likely located in the following code block:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs when the input `key` is list-like. When the condition `not is_list_like(key)` is evaluated to `False`, the code falls back to `self.loc[key]`, but this is incorrect behavior. This results in a `KeyError` being raised when attempting to use a list key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug involves handling the list-like input separately from the other cases. We need to distinguish between different types of input (`list`, `numpy.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) and handle the list-like input in a way that does not cause a `KeyError` to be raised, similar to the behavior seen in other cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like input separately
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other input types
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

By handling the list-like input separately and returning `self.loc[key]` for this case, we can prevent the `KeyError` from being raised and ensure consistent behavior across different input types.
