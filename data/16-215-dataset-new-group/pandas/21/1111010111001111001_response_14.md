Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the bug occurs when the `key` is of type `Index` or a similar non-list-like data type. The function does not correctly handle this type of input and does not return the expected output.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle `key` of type `Index` and other non-list-like data types appropriately. One way to do this is to update the function to handle the case when `key` is an instance of `Index` specifically, and to delegate the logic for other non-list-like data types to the existing code that handles the key type inference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly handles the `Index` type, and delegates the logic for other non-list-like data types to the existing code that handles type inference.

With this correction, the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
