The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional statement at the end of the function. The bug occurs when the `key_type` is inferred as `'string'` but the incoming `key` is a list or ndarray. This triggers the reindex operation, causing the KeyError to be raised.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statement to check for the type of `key` earlier in the function and handle the cases accordingly. We should also handle the case where `key` is a list or ndarray with no matches to the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Check if key is a tuple or not list-like
    if isinstance(key, tuple) or not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        result = self.reindex(key)
        if result.isna().all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return result

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case where `key` is a list or ndarray separately and check if the result is all NA, in which case we raise a KeyError indicating that none of the elements in `key` are in the index. This will resolve the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
