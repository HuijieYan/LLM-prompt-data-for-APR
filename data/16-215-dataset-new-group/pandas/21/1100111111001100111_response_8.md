The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the function is not treating list indexers the same as array-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior and KeyError exceptions when using lists. This inconsistency is also reflected in failing test cases, as shown by the GitHub issue.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves treating list indexers the same as array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers and avoid KeyError exceptions when using lists.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar to list for consistent behavior

    # The following block handles different cases of indexers
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that list indexers are treated like array-like indexers to provide consistent behavior and avoid KeyError exceptions, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
