The issue seems to be with the key_type variable, which is being assigned a value of "string". However, based on the input and the context, it should be assigned a value of "object" or "label" to correctly identify the type of the key.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that key_type is correctly assigned based on the type of the key input. We can modify the conditions for key_type assignment and ensure that appropriate types are assigned to key_type based on the input key type.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            key_type = "boolean"
        elif is_integer(key):
            key_type = "integer"
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key_type = "position"
        else:
            key_type = "label"

    if key_type == "label":
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif key_type == "position":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:  # handle other types
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we use additional checks to infer the type of the key based on its properties and context, and then determine the appropriate action to perform based on the inferred type. This should address the issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios.
