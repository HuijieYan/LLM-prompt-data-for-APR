The given buggy function needs to be updated. The error message suggests that the function is failing to raise a KeyError under certain circumstances. 

Looking into the code, the issue is likely with the checking of the 'is_list_like' condition and the subsequent logic to handle the correct data types for effective indexing. When receiving the input 'key', the code is intended to handle specific conditions based on the data type of 'key'. However, the current implementation is not properly handling the 'list', 'ndarray', 'Index', and 'Series' data types.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly check the data type of 'key' and handle it accordingly for effective indexing. The conditional checks need to be modified for handling the data types correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
            key = [key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these modifications, the corrected function should now handle the indexing conditions for different data types as intended and pass the failing test cases.
