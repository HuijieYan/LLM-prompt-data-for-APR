The issue in the buggy function `_get_with` seems to be related to how different types of indexers are treated. When a list indexer is used, it is not handled properly, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

Based on the failing test case and the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to different behaviors of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The issue mentions that `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError`, while `ser[pd.Index(key)]` and `ser[np.array(key)]` do not. It seems like the bug is causing inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. We can modify the handling of list indexers to be consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle non-array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making this modification, the function should now properly handle all types of indexers, including list indexers, and provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers, resolving the issue identified in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
