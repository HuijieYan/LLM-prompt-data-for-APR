## The bug in the _get_with function

### Problem:
The bug seems to be in the way the function handles the input variable `key`. It fails to accurately determine the data type of the key, which causes issues for further processing. The function tries to infer the data type of the key, but it reaches incorrect conclusions, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to improve the process of inferring the data type for the `key` input. By checking the type of the `key` and the type of inferences made, we can determine the appropriate modifications to make the function more robust and able to handle different types of input keys.

### The corrected version of the _get_with function
```python
# This is the corrected version of the _get_with function

def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Update the data type inference logic
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (Index, range)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type: {}".format(type(key)))
```

By reorganizing and updating the inference logic for the key data type, we can ensure that the function handles different types of keys correctly and returns the expected results. The improved logic provides a more robust way to handle different key types.
