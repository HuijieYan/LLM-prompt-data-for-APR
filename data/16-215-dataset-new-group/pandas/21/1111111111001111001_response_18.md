Looking at the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue might be occurring when the key is a single element (not a list or ndarray) and it is not found in the index of the series.

The bug seems to be occurring because the logic to handle non-list-like and non-array-like `key` variable is not correct. It returns with either `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]`, which is not the correct behavior for non-existing keys.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block to properly handle the case when `key` is not list-like or array-like. Instead of returning `self.loc[key]`, we need to raise an exception or return a default value if the key is not found in the index.

Based on the expected behavior, the corrected version of the buggy function is as follows:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
```

With this corrected function, it should handle non-list-like keys and return the expected outcome.
