### Identified Potential Error Locations and Bug Cause
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. It is related to treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. When accessing a `Series` using a list key, it results in a `KeyError`, while similar access using other array-like indexers does not.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle the list key properly, leading to the `KeyError`. This inconsistency in behavior is mentioned in the GitHub issue, and it has been identified that the `ser.loc[key]` also raises for all 4 cases.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
The strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers. The `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list keys in the same way as other array-like indexers are handled. This will align the behavior of accessing a `Series` using different indexers and resolve the `KeyError` issue.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding an explicit condition to handle the list key similar to other array-like indexers, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures consistent behavior for accessing a `Series` with different types of indexers. This will resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
