To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior for list indexers should be made consistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers.

The root cause of the bug is that when a list indexer is passed to the `_get_with` function, it raises a `KeyError` for certain cases, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by updating the condition for handling list indexers and ensuring that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Updated condition for handling list indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now handles list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior for both list and array-like indexers is aligned and does not lead to inconsistencies.

The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. It ensures that the function behaves consistently when handling list indexers and array-like indexers.
