To address the issue, we need to fix the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of the `pandas/core/series.py` file. 

### Bug analysis
The function currently fails to handle the input `key` properly. It incorrectly calculates the `key_type` based on the input `key`, which leads to an error when further processing the `key` fails to align with the type.

The error message indicates a failure to raise the `KeyError` as expected, which suggests that the function is not handling the index of the `key` correctly.

### Bug cause
The buggy function fails to correctly infer the type of the input `key` before performing operations based on its type. This leads to errors when trying to process the `key` based on its inferred type, as the type inference step is incorrect.

### Bug fix strategy
We need to fix the type inference step to accurately determine the type of the input `key`. This will ensure that subsequent processing of the `key` is aligned with its type, avoiding errors related to incorrect type handling.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function updates the type inference step to ensure that the type of the input `key` is accurately determined before further processing. This should resolve the bugs related to incorrect type handling and ensure that the function behaves as expected for different types of inputs.

The corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
