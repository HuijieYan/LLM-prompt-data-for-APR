The function `_get_with` in the source code is causing the failing test cases as it's designed to handle key indexing based on different types of inputs such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, integer, boolean, or reindex. It seems like the buggy function fails to handle the 'box' type provided in the failing test.

The failing test case tries to call `ser[key]`, which is the key indexing with the 'box' type as input and as a result expects it to raise a KeyError with the specified message.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function fails to handle the `box` type and its corresponding behavior as indicated in the failing test case. The error message indicates that the specific error was not raised as expected.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the given 'box' type and ensure that it can correctly handle key indexing with the provided input. Specifically, we need to add a condition to handle the `box` type input to avoid the raised KeyError in the failing test case.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the 'box' type and the failing test should pass with the corrected function.
