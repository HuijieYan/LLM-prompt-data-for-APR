The buggy function `_get_with` seems to have issues with identifying the type of the `key` variable and determining the appropriate action based on that type. The `key_type` variable is incorrectly being assigned the value `'string'` in all cases.

The bug is likely caused by the function incorrectly identifying the type of the `key` variable leading to the wrong execution path.

To fix the bug:
1. We should ensure that the correct type of the key is determined.
2. Based on the type of the key, the function should take appropriate actions such as slicing, getting values tuple, or reindexing.
3. We can use the `is_list_like` function to correctly identify list-like objects.
4. The function has a redundant check for `isinstance(key, list)` that can be removed.
5. The conditional check for the key_type should be more comprehensive, covering different data types such as boolean, series, etc.

Here's a corrected version of the function taking into account the potential fixes:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid key type")
```

In the corrected version, we use the `is_scalar` function to check for non-list-like scalars. We then appropriately check for list-like objects using the `is_list_like` function. We also handle the inferred type based on the actual type of the key. We also added a catch-all else statement to throw an error if the key type is invalid.
