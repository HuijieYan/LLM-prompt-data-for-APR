The bug originates in the `_get_with` function within the pandas `Series` class. The function is overcomplicating how it interacts with different types of input data. The error messages indicate that the bug is related to the slicing/indexing of the series with unexpected input types. 

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic of how different data types are handled. Specifically, handle the case of a plain list or numpy array differently from the pandas specific types, and simplify the conditional statements to make it clearer how each type of input should be handled.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version simplifies the conditional statements and directly checks for a scalar value using `is_scalar`. It removes unnecessary checks for specific types (e.g., `is_list_like(key)`) and treats scalar values differently from non-scalar values. This should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases.
