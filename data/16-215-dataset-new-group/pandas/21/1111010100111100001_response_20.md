The bug in the function `_get_with(key)` from the class `Series` in the pandas package is that it attempts to index a Series with a key that is not supported, which leads to a KeyError.

The bug occurs because the function does not recognize the type of the key correctly and attempts to use a default behavior that does not match the given key type. Specifically, when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray, the function should utilize the `self.loc` method for these types of keys. However, the function currently does not correctly check for these types before attempting to use `self.loc`, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to correctly identify the type of the key and then use the appropriate method (`self.loc` or `self.iloc`) based on the type of the key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the type of the key and use the `self.loc` method if the key is a supported type, or raise an error if the key is not supported.

By applying this fix, the failing tests should now pass without raising a KeyError.
