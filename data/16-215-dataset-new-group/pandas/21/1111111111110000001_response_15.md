The bug is due to improper handling of key when the key is a list or an ndarray type. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class in the file pandas/core/series.py fails the test case by not correctly handling the key. The bug raises a `KeyError` when it should not.

The cause of the bug is that the key is not properly handled when it is a list or ndarray type. The error message indicates that "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]", which suggests that the key is not being recognized properly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the way the key is handled when it is a list or an ndarray type to ensure it is recognized properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is not list-like or an array, then convert it to a list. We also check the key type and default to positional indexing when needed.

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
