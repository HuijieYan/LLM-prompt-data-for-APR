The buggy function `_get_with` has a bug where it tries to access the key as a series, causing a KeyError to be raised. The bug is taking place in the conditional statement `elif not is_list_like(key)` which does not account for when the key is a series.

The cause of the bug is related to the conditional statement not correctly handling the case when the `key` is an instance of `Series`. The error arises as a KeyError because the invalid key type is passed to the `loc` attribute of the Series, resulting in a failed test and a corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement `elif not is_list_like(key)`, and the subsequent `return self.loc[key]` should be modified to handle the specific condition when `key` is an instance of `Series`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle the case where the key is an instance of Series
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "boolean":
            raise ValueError(
                "Boolean indexing is not supported by Series with a multiIndex"
            )
        return self._get_values_tuple(key.values)
    else:
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```

This fix will handle the specific condition when `key` is an instance of `Series`, and utilize the values of the Series for indexing, resolving the raised KeyError in the failing test.
