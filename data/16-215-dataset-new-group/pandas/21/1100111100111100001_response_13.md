Based on the analysis of the failing test cases, it seems that the bug is causing the function to return the wrong type for the `key_type` variable. It is consistently returning `'string'`, which is unexpected.

The cause of the bug is likely the code that infers the data type of the `key` parameter. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key, leading to incorrect subsequent branching logic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type inference for the `key` parameter is accurate. We can use the `type` function to determine the type of the `key` parameter, and make appropriate adjustments to the branching logic based on the inferred type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    key_type = type(key).__name__
  
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
  
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
  
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
  
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
  
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
  
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the type of `key` parameter is inferred using the `type` function, and the inferred type is used for branching logic to handle different types of keys appropriately.

This corrected version should address the issues raised by the failing test cases and should no longer raise any errors.
