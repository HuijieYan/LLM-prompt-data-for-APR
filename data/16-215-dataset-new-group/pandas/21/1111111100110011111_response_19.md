The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the way list indexers are treated differently from other indexers. The error message suggests that when using `ser[list(key)]`, a KeyError is raised, while other types of indexers do not produce the same behavior.

The cause of this bug could be related to the type checking and handling done within the `_get_with` function. It appears that there is inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, which leads to a KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior and error handling for different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that aims to address the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # ensure key is an index

    # handle the case where the indexer is a list
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we first ensure that the input `key` is converted to an index using `ensure_index(key)`. This ensures that regardless of the input type, it is treated consistently as an index.

By using `ensure_index` and handling lists and arrays separately, we aim to achieve consistent behavior for different types of indexers, addressing the inconsistency and the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values of the function, while resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
