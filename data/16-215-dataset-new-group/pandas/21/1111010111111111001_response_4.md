The issue with the current implementation is that the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not taking appropriate actions for the provided keys. It is failing to handle the case when the key is not present in the series index.

In particular, the function is failing to handle the case when the key is not found in the series index and is not correctly raising a KeyError. This can be seen from the error messages of the failing tests where the expected KeyError is not being raised.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the cases when the key is not found in the series index and raise a KeyError with an appropriate message.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError as e:
        msg = f"None of {key} are in the index"
        raise KeyError(msg) from e
```

In this corrected version, we use a try-except block to attempt to access the key using `self.loc[key]`. If a KeyError is raised during this attempt, we catch it, create an appropriate message, and re-raise the KeyError with the new message.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It correctly handles the case when the key is not found in the series index and raises a KeyError with the expected message.
