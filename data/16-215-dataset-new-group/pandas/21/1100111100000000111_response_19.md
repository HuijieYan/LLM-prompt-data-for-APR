The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The issue posted on GitHub points out that when using `ser[list(key)]`, it raises a KeyError, whereas it doesn't raise an error when using `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, or `ser[np.array(key)]`. It also mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises for all 4 cases.

The inconsistent behavior is likely caused by the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure that all indexers behave consistently, and also make sure that the behavior aligns with the expectations of the users.

Here's an updated version of the `_get_with` function that aims to resolve the issue:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
            key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we use `ensure_index` to ensure that the indexers are consistently handled, and we also check for specific types of indexers to determine the appropriate behavior.

This updated version should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that indexers behave consistently across all cases.
