The issue with the buggy function is that it is unable to handle the key that is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series when the key is not present in the index of the Series. This causes the function to raise a KeyError instead of properly handling the input.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not checking the existence of the key within the index before trying to access it, leading to a KeyError being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if the key is present in the index before accessing it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "string" and not key.isin(self.index).any():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    # other part of the function
    # ... rest of the original function here
```

This version of the function checks if the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, and if so, it verifies if the key values are present in the index of the Series. If not, it raises a KeyError with a specific message.

With this change, the function should now properly handle the input and pass the failing tests.
