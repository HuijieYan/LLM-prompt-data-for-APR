The issue appears to be related to the handling of different indexers in the `ser[key]` operation. The tests are failing when using different types of indexers such as list, array, Index, and Series. The specific error message is "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".

The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of indexers, but it's not handling the list-like indexers properly. This leads to inconsistent behavior and errors in the tests.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers correctly, so that it behaves consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
    raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected version:
1. The input `key` is checked if it's list-like using `is_list_like`.
2. If `key` is list-like, it is directly used in `self.loc[key]`.
3. If `key` is not list-like, it goes through the checks for other types and handles them accordingly.
4. If the input is not recognized as any of the supported types, it raises a `TypeError`.

This corrected version should handle list-like indexers consistently and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
