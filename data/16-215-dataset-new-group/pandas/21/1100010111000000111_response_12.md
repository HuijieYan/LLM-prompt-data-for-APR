The issue appears to be that the implementation of `_get_with` function in `pandas/core/series.py` does not handle list-like key indexers properly. As indicated in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`, the function raises a KeyError when trying to access an element with a list-like key that does not exist in the series. This is inconsistent with how the function handles other types of key indexers such as np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series.

The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" confirms the inconsistency and suggests that the behavior for list indexers is different from other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key indexers correctly and consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_bool(key):
        return self._get_values_bool(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I modified the logic to explicitly check if the key is a list-like object and handle it accordingly by converting it to a list and then checking its type to perform the appropriate indexing operation.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle list-like key indexers correctly and consistently with other array-like indexers, thereby passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
