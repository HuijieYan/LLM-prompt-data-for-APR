The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to how list indexers are handled, as described in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches". The issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers, as opposed to array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError.

Upon analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it is apparent that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as "string" in all cases, regardless of the actual types of the input keys. This could potentially lead to incorrect branching logic within the function, causing unexpected behavior when handling different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the indexers is correctly identified and processed. We should also address the inconsistency in behavior for list indexers compared to array-like indexers, as referenced in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the case of non-list-like keys and non-Index keys
        key = [key]

    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # handle the case of non-list-like and non-Index key types
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the case of non-list-like and non-Index keys by converting them to a list. Then, we identify the type of the key and handle integer keys, list-like keys, and other key types accordingly, ensuring consistent behavior. Additionally, we address the inconsistency noted in the GitHub issue, ensuring that all types of indexers are treated consistently.
