### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists. However, based on the failing tests and the runtime input/output values, it seems that there is a problem with how the function handles the input key type and how it processes the index for lookups.

In all the failing test cases, the key that is passed to the `_get_with` function is not being handled correctly. This leads to a KeyError being raised when the function attempts to fetch the corresponding values.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the `key_type` variable is always being inferred as `'string'`, which indicates that the logic for inferring the key type within the function is not working as intended.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the logic for inferring the key type within the `_get_with` function needs to be updated. Additionally, the key type should be appropriately matched to the index type to ensure correct lookups.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":  # Updated to check for string type
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for inferring the key type has been updated to correctly identify string types, and the lookup based on key type has been adjusted to match the inferred type. This should address the issues with the failing tests.
