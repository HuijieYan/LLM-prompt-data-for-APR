The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` module is meant to handle various types of input keys and return the appropriate values based on those keys. However, there are several issues with the current implementation.

1. The function is not handling the cases where `key` is a scalar or a boolean. 
2. There are redundant checks for the type of `key` which may lead to incorrect handling of the input.

To fix these issues, a revised implementation of the function can handle the scalar and boolean cases separately and avoid unnecessary type checks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle scalar values
    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"Key error: {key}")
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # handle boolean values
    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    # handle slices
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    # handle DataFrames
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    # handle tuples and other cases
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    # handle list-like and other cases
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles scalar, boolean, and other list-like input keys and directly returns the appropriate values based on the input. It also removes unnecessary type checks and ensures that the input is handled correctly.

This should address the issues related to handling different types of input keys and returning the appropriate values based on the input in a more efficient manner.
