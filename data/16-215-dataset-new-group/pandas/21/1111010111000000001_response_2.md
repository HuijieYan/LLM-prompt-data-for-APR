The provided buggy function is part of the `pandas` core library and is supposed to handle indexing a `Series` object with a key. However, there are several potential error locations within this function:

1. The `elif` statement checking if `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame` is incorrect and should likely be checking for a `DataFrame`, not specifically an abstract base class. This could result in incorrect type checking for the `key` argument.

2. The check to see if `key` is non-list-like appears to incorrectly assume that scalars that aren't recognized by `lib.is_scalar` should be passed to `self.loc`. Using brackets `[]` might solve the issue.

3. The logic for handling `key` when it's not an instance of `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index` may also be incorrect.

Given these potential error locations, it seems that the cause of the bug may be an incorrect type check for the `key` argument, leading to incorrect handling of different types of keys.

To fix the bug, it would be necessary to:
- Correct the type checks for the `key` argument and ensure that the appropriate operations are performed based on its type.
- Make sure that the logic for handling different types of keys is correct and complete.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function will then be as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the type checks have been revised to handle different types of keys correctly, and the logic for handling the different types of keys has been improved and should now work as intended.
