The buggy function is failing because it is not handling the input parameter 'key' correctly. It is supposed to determine the type of the key and perform different operations based on the type. However, it seems to be incorrectly identifying the key type and returning a wrong result.

The bug seems to be related to the identification of the key type within the function. The code incorrectly identifies the key type as 'string' in all cases. This is likely due to incorrect type inference or checking logic within the function.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly identify the type of the key and perform the appropriate operations based on this type.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if the key is a scalar (single value) and then directly return the value using `loc`. We also changed the conditions for determining the key type and the subsequent operations based on the type of the key.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys and avoid the bug identified in the failing tests.
