The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of input keys and return the appropriate values based on the input type. However, it seems to have a bug that incorrectly identifies the type of the key, leading to unexpected behavior.

Upon analyzing the function and the runtime input/output values, the bug is likely caused by the incorrect identification of the key type within the function. The function uses the `key_type` variable to determine the type of the key, but the logic for determining the type seems flawed, as reflected in the runtime values.

To fix the bug, the type of the key should be correctly determined using a more accurate method. This can be achieved by ensuring that the type of the key is properly identified before the conditional branches based on the key type are executed. Additionally, we need to handle the different cases of keys more consistently to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the type of the key is determined consistently and accurately. Additionally, the handling of different types of keys is made more uniform to ensure that the correct behavior is maintained across different input cases.
