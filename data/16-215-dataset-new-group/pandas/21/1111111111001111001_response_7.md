To correct the buggy function, we need to update the `_get_with` function that is part of the `Series` class. Based on the failing tests and the provided class and related function documentation, it appears that the issue might be related to the incorrect type inference for the key parameter within the `_get_with` function.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # treat non-list-like keys as positional
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version includes the following changes:

1. We've added a condition to handle non-list-like keys separately, treating them as positional indexes and converting them to a list. This is to avoid potential issues with non-list-like keys being incorrectly inferred as certain type.

2. We've removed the type inference logic (`lib.infer_dtype`) and key type comparison (`key_type == "integer"`) as they might not be handling the key types correctly.

3. We also handled the case where the key is a NumPy array or ExtensionArray by ensuring a valid index type, ensuring consistency in handling different key types.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of keys correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
