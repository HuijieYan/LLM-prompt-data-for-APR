The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is not handling the case where a list-like key with no matches is passed to the `ser[key]` operation. This leads to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers such as arrays or Index objects.

The bug is evident from the failing test "test_getitem_no_matches" in the file "pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py". The error message indicates that the `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when using a list-like key with no matches.

To fix the bug, an additional condition should be added to check for list-like keys with no matches and raise a `KeyError` if none of the keys are found in the index.

Therefore, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function is as follows:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if len(key) > 0:  # Check if key is not empty
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version includes a check for the length of the key and raises a `KeyError` if the key is empty. This ensures consistent behavior when using list-like keys with no matches, resolving the issue described in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
