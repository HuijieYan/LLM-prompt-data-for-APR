## A corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            f"Indexing a Series with {type(key).__name__} is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Given the information provided, I have made the following changes to the `_get_with` function:
1. I added a further validation check. If the key is not list-like or is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, a `TypeError` is raised.
2. I modified the `if` condition to include the additional case for a `TypeError` to be raised with the message specific to the type of `key` used.
3. I have also modified the order of the condition checks to ensure that the correct type of operation is performed on the `key`.
4. I kept the remaining logic unchanged, as the other conditions seemed to be falsy when the failing test was executed.

This corrected version of the function should address the issues observed in the failing tests.

Please note that the provided imports at the beginning of the code snippet are standard imports for the `pandas` library, and they have not been modified.
