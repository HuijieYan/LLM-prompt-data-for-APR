To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to rework the logic for handling different types of input key. The issue seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers. Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it appears that the handling of list indexers differs from other types of indexers, leading to the KeyError.

Here's a revised version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version consolidates the handling of different types of input keys. If the key is list-like, it uses `self.loc[key]`, and for other types of keys, it uses `self.reindex(key)`.

This approach simplifies the logic and should address the issue of inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other indexers. It also aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue description. After making this change, the failing test should pass, and the issue described in GitHub can be resolved.
