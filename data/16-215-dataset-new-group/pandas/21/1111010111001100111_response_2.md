In the given buggy function `_get_with`, the issue arises from the inconsistent behavior of how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, causing a KeyError in certain cases when attempting to access the series using a list key.

The bug is caused by inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, which leads to a KeyError when accessing the series using a list key.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers more consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        # Handle DataFrame key
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        # Handle tuple key
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Handle scalar key
        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Handle non-list-like array-like indexers
        elif is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Handle reindexing for other cases
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function properly handles list indexers and treats them consistently with other array-like indexers, preventing the KeyError from occurring.
