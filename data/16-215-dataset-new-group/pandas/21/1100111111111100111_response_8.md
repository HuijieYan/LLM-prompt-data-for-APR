To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency between how list indexers and array-like indexers are treated. The issue raised on GitHub also highlights this inconsistency.

The main issue seems to be that when using a list as the indexer, the function is raising a KeyError, while for other array-like indexers it does not. We can address this by treating all types of indexers consistently.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers in a more consistent manner. Additionally, we can ensure that the behavior of the function matches the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Treat all indexers as list-like
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, we ensure that all types of indexers are treated as list-like, and we explicitly convert them to a list if they are not already one. This should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and provide a more consistent behavior for the function.

By making this change, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
