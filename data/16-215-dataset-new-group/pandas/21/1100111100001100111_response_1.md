The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect handling of certain types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue mentioned.

In the given runtime examples, the variable `key_type` remains as `'string'` for all cases, indicating that the conditional checks within the function are not accurately determining the type of the input `key`.

To fix the bug, we should revise the conditional checks and type inference for the `key` variable to ensure that the function handles different types of indexers consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the case for Index
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, changes have been made to ensure that the type inference for `key` is accurate. Additionally, the conditional checks have been revised to handle different types of indexers consistently, resolving the bug as described in the GitHub issue.
