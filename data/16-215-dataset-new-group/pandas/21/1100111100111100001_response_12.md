Based on the failing tests and the given runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of the `key` parameter and its type. The function is unable to handle different types of keys properly, leading to the KeyError in the tests.

It's evident that the function is expecting the `key` parameter to be a list or similar data structures. However, in the failing tests, the `key` parameter is provided in different forms such as a list, ndarray, and Index. This inconsistency in handling different types of keys is causing the bug.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle different types of keys uniformly. Specifically, it should correctly handle ndarray and Index as input types for the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index))):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the `_get_with` function will be able to handle different types of keys uniformly, which should fix the bug identified in the failing tests.
