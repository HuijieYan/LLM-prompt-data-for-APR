The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the processing of the `key` variable, as it is encountering issues when trying to handle the input key in certain formats such as a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series.

When analyzing the provided test cases, it seems that the function is failing to properly handle the input `key` in different formats. The `key` variable is not being processed effectively to retrieve the desired values from the Series `self`. This is leading to errors such as `KeyError` due to mismatched or incorrect handling of the `key` variable during indexing.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the function is capable of effectively handling different formats of the `key` input, such as list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. This involves implementing conditional checks based on the type of the `key` variable and then processing it accordingly within the function to retrieve the desired values from the Series `self`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Process different types of keys
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, ABCDataFrame)):
        # Handle DataFrame type key
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        # Process tuple type key
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        # Handle scalar type key
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Process list-like type key
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Handle other types of keys by reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added conditional checks to handle different types of `key` inputs effectively, including the case of list, numpy array, pandas Index, pandas Series, and other scalar or list-like types.

By implementing these conditional checks and processing the `key` variable based on its type, we can ensure that the function can effectively retrieve the desired values from the Series `self` for a wide range of input formats, resolving the bug encountered in the failing test cases.
