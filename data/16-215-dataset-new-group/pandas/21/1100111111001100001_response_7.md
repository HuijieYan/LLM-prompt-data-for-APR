The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of different data types for the `key` parameter. Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it seems that the `key_type` is always being inferred as `'string'`, which is incorrect.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` parameter, leading to the incorrect type inference.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the different data types for the `key` parameter, and ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case when `key` is scalar separately and then proceed to infer the type of `key` and handle it accordingly. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly in handling different types of `key` parameters.
