The issue here is that the behavior of the `ser` series is inconsistent when using different types of indexers, such as list, array-like, and index objects. In particular, when using a list indexer, the function is not properly handling the case when there are no matches in the index, leading to a `KeyError` being raised inconsistently.

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the conditional handling of indexers. Specifically, the handling of list-like indexers may be problematic, leading to inconsistent behavior when there are no matches in the index.

To fix the bug, one strategy could be to ensure consistent error handling for different types of indexers, such as list, array-like, and index objects. This could involve properly checking for matching index values and handling the case when there are no matches, consistently across different types of indexers.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the issue:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that `KeyError` is properly caught and handled for different types of indexers, allowing for consistent behavior when there are no matches in the index.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue posted.
