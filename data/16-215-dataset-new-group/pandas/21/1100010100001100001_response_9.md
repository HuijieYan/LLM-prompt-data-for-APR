To fix the bug in the provided function `_get_with`, we need to modify the logic for determining the `key_type`, as it is currently incorrect. Based on the runtime input/output variable values provided for the failing test cases, we can see that the `key_type` is always determined as `'string'`, which is incorrect.

This incorrect determination of `key_type` is causing the function to return the wrong output. To fix this issue, we need to update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key` being passed to the function.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to update the part of the code where `key_type` is being determined. We need to accurately identify the type of `key` and assign the correct type to `key_type` to ensure that the function returns the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_with` with the updated logic for determining `key_type`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Invalid key type: {type(key)}")

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key` being passed. We handle different types of keys such as ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, and list separately to accurately infer the `key_type` and return the expected output.
