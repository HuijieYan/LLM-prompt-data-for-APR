Before starting any fixes, let's analyze the buggy function and the failing test, as well as the corresponding error messages and the GitHub issue description.

The buggy function `_get_with` takes a key as input and checks its type to determine the appropriate action. The issue arises when the key is a list, as it results in inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like indexers.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses the `ser[key]` syntax to access a Series using a key, and it expects a KeyError to be raised. However, the KeyError is not being raised, which indicates that the function is not behaving as expected when given a list as the key.

The error message from the failing test points to inconsistent behavior based on the type of indexers used. It also mentions the inconsistency when using `ser.loc[key]`.

The GitHub issue further elaborates on the inconsistency, demonstrating that the behavior for list indexers is different from other array-like indexers. It references a specific test case added in a pull request and highlights the need to make all cases behave consistently.

To fix the bug, we can modify the behavior of the function when a list key is encountered to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values(key)  # Modified behavior for list key

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when the key is detected as a list, the function now calls `_get_values` to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This fix should resolve the inconsistency and make the function behave as expected when using a list as the key.
