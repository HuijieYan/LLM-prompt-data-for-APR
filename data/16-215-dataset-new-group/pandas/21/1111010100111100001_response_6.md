The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional block that checks the type of the `key` parameter in the Series class. The bug causes the function to not handle the `key` parameter correctly, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

The bug occurs because the key is being converted into a list without verifying its type. This results in an incorrect handling of different types of keys, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to check the type of the key and handle it accordingly without converting it into a list inappropriately.

Here is the revised and corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not " "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the type of the `key` parameter is checked and handled appropriately without unnecessary conversions. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for different types of keys.
