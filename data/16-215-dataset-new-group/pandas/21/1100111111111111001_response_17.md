The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The bug is causing the function to raise a `KeyError` when attempting to slice the series using a slice or an array, resulting in a failure to handle these types of inputs correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the given key types properly. The key types should be recognized and sliced accordingly, but the function wrongly attempts to slice non-sliceable types, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we should update the conditional checks in the function to properly handle the different types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if is_bool(key):
            # filtering condition
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the different types of keys and perform the corresponding operations without raising a `KeyError`. This will allow the function to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
