The potential error locations within the `Series._get_with` function are:

1. The condition `if isinstance(key, tuple)` might be taking the wrong code path.
2. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key): return self.loc[key]` might not be handling scalars correctly.
3. The condition `elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` might not be handling the key correctly.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates that the Series `ser` should raise a `KeyError` containing the message `None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]` when attempting to index it with a key `'C'`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `key` is a scalar correctly, and we also need to make sure we handle all required conditions properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the case where the key is not a scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # handle the case where the key is a scalar
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, ValueError):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")
```

This corrected version should handle both scalar and non-scalar keys, and it should pass the failing test provided.
