Based on the analysis of the failing test and runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug is caused by inconsistency in how different indexers are treated. The issue on GitHub also highlights this inconsistency and suggests that all cases should behave like the list case.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function should be modified to treat all indexers consistently. The corrected version of the function should handle all types of indexers (list, numpy array, Index, Series) in the same way, ensuring that the behavior is consistent and matches the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version treats all indexers in a consistent manner, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
