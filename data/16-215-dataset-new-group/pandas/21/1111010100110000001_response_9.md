The bug is likely in the function `_get_with()` of the `Series` class, specifically in the part where it's dealing with different types of `key`. The function is not doing the correct operations based on the type of `key` given. The failing test suggests that the error is likely due to failing to raise a `KeyError`.

The function needs to be adjusted so that when the `key` is a list or an array, a `KeyError` is correctly raised. The function should also be restructured to handle the `key` cases properly.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")
```

With these changes, the key will now correctly handle different types of input and appropriately raise a `KeyError` when encountering an input that is not in the index.
