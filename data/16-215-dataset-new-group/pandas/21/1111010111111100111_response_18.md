The issue occurs in the `_get_with()` function of the `Series` class, specifically when handling list-like input for indexing.

The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers (array-like vs. list) in the `ser[key]` operation. The failing test case involves passing a list-like indexer to the `Series` object, resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and unify the handling of these cases in the `_get_with()` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Reindex the Series
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle the cases where the indexer is a slice or a DataFrame, and then check if the indexer is a scalar. If it's a scalar, we use the `loc` function to retrieve the value. If it's not a scalar, we convert it to a list if it's not already list-like, and then reindex the `Series` based on the updated indexer.

By making these changes, we ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers and resolve the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
