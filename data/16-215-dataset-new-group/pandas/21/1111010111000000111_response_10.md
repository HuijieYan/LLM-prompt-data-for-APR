The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class raises an error when the key is an instance of a list. This causes inconsistency with the behavior of other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function handles list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in an inconsistency in behavior. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` where the error message indicates that none of the index items are found in the index.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Combining list-like check with dictionary-like
    if not (is_list_like(key) or is_dict_like(key)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Simplify handling the case for list indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

With the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, consistency in handling list indexers is achieved, and the function will no longer raise errors when list indexers are used. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test.
