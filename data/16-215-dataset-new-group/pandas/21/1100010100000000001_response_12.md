The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexing keys for a Pandas Series object. However, there are potential error locations within the function that are causing it to not work as expected.

1. The function checks if the key is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or not list-like, but the logic in the subsequent blocks does not handle all these cases correctly.
2. There are multiple conditions that are not properly handling the key type, and there is a mix of using `loc` and `iloc` with insufficient checks for the type of key being used.
3. The logic for determining the type of key and deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing is flawed, leading to incorrect results or errors during indexing operations.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve adjusting the handling of different key types in a more consistent and clear manner, ensuring that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of key being provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) or is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type in ["mixed-integer-bool", "integer_na"]:
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:  # label-based key
            return self.loc[key]
    else:  # handle the default case by reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function starts by checking the type of `key` and then handles each case accordingly. The use of `loc` and `iloc` is determined based on the type of key being used, and the code is made more readable and explicit in terms of its handling of different key types. Additionally, the code includes checks for scalar and boolean keys separately.
