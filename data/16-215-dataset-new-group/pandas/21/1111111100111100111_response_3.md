The bug seems to be related to how the `key` is handled inside the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list, the function fails to handle it correctly. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with a list.

The cause of the bug is related to how the function handles the different types of keys and determines their type and if it should be treated as a positional or label-based indexer. The bug is also related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers needs to be aligned with the behavior of array-like indexers. This should involve updating the logic to correctly determine the type of key and how it should be treated. Additionally, the handling of list indexers should be consistent with how other indexers are handled to ensure uniform behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['string', 'unicode']:  # Updated condition to handle list indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated logic, the function will correctly handle list indexers and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This should resolve the issue and make the function behave as expected.
