1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class, which is a one-dimensional ndarray with axis labels. The function handles different types of indexers and determines how to retrieve data based on the type of the indexer.

2. Potential error locations within the function include the conditional branches for different types of indexers such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and non-list-like indexers.

3. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when indexing a `Series` object with different types of indexers. The GitHub issue indicates that the behavior of indexing with a list indexer is different from indexing with other types (slices, dataframes, etc.). The inconsistency results in errors and unexpected behavior when retrieving data using list-like indexers.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers when indexing a `Series`. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for handling list-like indexers and ensuring that they behave consistently with other types of indexers.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we use the `is_list_like` function to check if the key is list-like. If it is, we use the `ensure_index` function to ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers. Then, we proceed with indexing using the `reindex` method. This approach ensures that all types of indexers behave consistently and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
