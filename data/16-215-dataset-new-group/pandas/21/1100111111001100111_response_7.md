## Analysis
The bug occurs when the `_get_with` function is called with different types of indexers, such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The bug causes inconsistency in behavior, and the test cases fail due to this inconsistency.

In the failing test, when using a list indexer, the function raises a KeyError with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers and does not align with the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug is likely the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function that handles different types of indexers. The logic does not handle the list indexer case correctly, resulting in the KeyError.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function needs to be revised to handle the list indexer case appropriately and ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers.

The revised logic should correctly handle the list indexer case, aligning with the behavior of other indexers. This may involve modifying the conditional statements and branching based on the type of the indexer.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        # By default, treat as positional indexer
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        # Otherwise, use label-based indexer
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conditional logic has been revised to handle the list indexer case and ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers. The conditions now correctly handle scalar, list, ndarray, Series, and Index types of indexers, ensuring proper indexing behavior and fixing the bug.
