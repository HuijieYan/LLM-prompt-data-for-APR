The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of the input key and determining its type. The function incorrectly identifies the type of the key, which leads to incorrect behavior when indexing the series. This results in KeyError being raised when attempting to access elements.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the key is correctly identified and handled for indexing the series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have addressed the incorrect handling of different key types and ensured proper type inference. This should resolve the KeyError issues and make the function work as intended.
