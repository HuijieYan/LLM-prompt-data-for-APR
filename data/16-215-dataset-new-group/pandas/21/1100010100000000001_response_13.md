## Analysis:
The function `_get_with` takes a key as an input and performs various operations based on the type of the key. The bug is likely to be in the conditional logic of how the different types of keys are handled, especially when checking for the type of the key and determining the operations to be performed.

## Potential errors:
1. Incorrect conditional checks for the type of the key.
2. Inconsistent handling of different key types.
3. Misuse of `loc` and `iloc` methods.

## Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from the inconsistent handling of different key types and incorrect conditional checks, leading to improper branching and execution of code that does not handle all possible input cases correctly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditional checks for key types and ensure that all possible types of keys are correctly identified and handled.
2. Refactor the conditional blocks to provide clear and comprehensive handling for each type of key.
3. Ensure proper use of `loc` and `iloc` methods for label-based and positional indexing, respectively, based on the key type.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if self.index._can_do_positional_indexing():
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]

        elif is_bool(key):
            # It is a boolean indexer
            return self.loc[key]

        elif is_categorical_dtype(key):
            # Categorical data, cannot be converted to positional indexer
            return self.loc[key]

        else:
            # Handle other types of keys by reindexing
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
