Based on the buggy function and related functions, it seems that there is a mix-up in handling different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The code should distinguish between different types of keys, such as slices, data frames, tuples, scalars, lists, and arrays, and handle them accordingly. 

The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of different types of keys, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors when using the _get_with function for indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of keys in the _get_with function to ensure that each type of key is processed correctly and yields the expected result during indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function with the handling of different key types:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            raise IndexError("Boolean indexing is not supported in Series")
        
        elif is_categorical_dtype(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Add more conditions for specific data types as needed
        
    else:
        raise IndexError("Unsupported key type for indexing Series")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional conditions to handle different types of keys, such as scalars, arrays, indexers, and specific data types. This should ensure that each type of key is processed correctly and prevent potential errors during indexing.
