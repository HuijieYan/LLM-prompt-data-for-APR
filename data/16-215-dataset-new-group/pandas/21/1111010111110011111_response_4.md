## Buggy Function Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class has a bug that causes it to produce inconsistent behavior when indexing with different data types such as list, array-like, or Index. The failing test indicates that using a list as an indexer results in a KeyError, while using other data types does not. The expected result for all data types should be consistent.

## Bug Location and Cause
The bug is likely caused by the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function, particularly in the section that handles different types of indexers. The specific cause of the bug is the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other data types, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior when handling different types of indexers. This may involve adjusting how the function determines the type of the indexer and how it handles the indexing operation.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we've made changes to handle list-like indexers consistently with other data types. We've also adjusted the logic to ensure that the type of the indexer is handled properly for all scenarios, leading to a more uniform behavior across different indexer types.
