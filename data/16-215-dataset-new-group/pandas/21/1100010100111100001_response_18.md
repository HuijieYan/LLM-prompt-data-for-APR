Based on the given error messages and runtime input/output, it seems that the 'key_type' is incorrectly identified as 'string' in all cases, which is leading to incorrect behavior when accessing the 'ser[key]'.

The cause of this bug is that the function incorrectly identifies the 'key_type' and handle the different types of keys. Specifically, when 'key' is a list, numpy array, Index, Series, or any other object, the function does not properly determine its type and handle it accordingly, leading to incorrect indexing and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we should accurately determine the type of key being used and appropriately handle it. We can use isinstance() checks to identify the type of 'key' and then perform the necessary operations based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        key_type = 'object'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for the type of 'key' using isinstance() and handle it accordingly. We also explicitly handle the 'key_type' based on its type, ensuring that the correct indexing operations are performed.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
