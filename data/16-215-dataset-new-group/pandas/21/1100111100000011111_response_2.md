The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the treatment of different types of indexers. The function is not handling list indexers correctly and is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers.

The cause of the bug is due to the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and address the inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)) or is_iterator(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, the handling of list indexers has been updated to be consistent with other array-like indexers. There's no longer a check for the Index type, and the `reindex` method is called directly for array-like indexers and iterators. The `key_type` is also determined after the check for non-list-like keys.

This correction ensures that all types of indexers, including list indexers, are handled consistently, resolving the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
