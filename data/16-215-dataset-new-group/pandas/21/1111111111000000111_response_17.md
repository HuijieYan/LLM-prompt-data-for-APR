The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to its treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. When the function receives a list key, it fails to handle it properly and raise a KeyError, while it behaves as expected for other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that when the function receives a list key, it doesn't handle it consistently with other array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers was reported in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle the list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, such as Index, ndarray, and Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list and other array-like indexers consistently
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is of type Index
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the received key is transformed into an Index type to handle it consistently with other array-like indexers. This modification should resolve the inconsistency in handling list indexers reported in the GitHub issue and make the function behave as expected for all types of indexers.
