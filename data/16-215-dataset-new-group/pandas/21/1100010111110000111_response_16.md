The issue being described is a inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers for a Series. When using a Series with a list indexer, it raises a KeyError if no matches are found, whereas using an array-like indexer or a pd.Index would not raise a KeyError in the same scenario. The expectant behavior is to make all of these indexers behave like the list case. 

The failing test code extracts a Series and uses a list as an indexer to access an element that is not in the index. The resulting KeyError is the evidence of a bug. The error message further confirms the bug stating that "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".

The `_get_with` function has a section of code that handles the situations for list-like indexers, but it seems to be inconsistent with the behavior described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the condition for list indexers needs to be handled similarly to the other array-like indexers, which will prevent the KeyError when no matches are found.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):  # fixed condition to handle list indexers similarly
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This should resolve the bug by handling the list indexers similarly to how other array-like indexers are handled, which aligns with the expected behavior explained in the GitHub issue.
