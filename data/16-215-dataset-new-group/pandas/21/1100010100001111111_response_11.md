The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key is a list. This is causing an inconsistency in the behavior of the function when compared to other indexers.

The bug is occurring because the function incorrectly handles list-like keys, leading to unexpected behavior. The issue appears to be related to different behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior when accessing a Series with different types of keys.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner, similar to how it handles array-like keys. This will ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the expected behavior for accessing a Series with different types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/series.py

def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will handle list-like keys consistently with array-like keys, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
