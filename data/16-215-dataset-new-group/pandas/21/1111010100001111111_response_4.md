The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class is causing inconsistent behavior in indexers, specifically when using list indexers. The bug is related to how different indexers are treated and the inconsistency in handling them.

The bug occurs when trying to access elements of the series using a list indexer. The function fails to handle list-like keys properly, resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to access elements using a list key. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers such as array-like indexers and index objects.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle list-like keys appropriately, ensuring that it aligns with the behavior of other indexers and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # handle scalar value
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, a check has been added to handle list-like keys separately, ensuring that it aligns with the behavior of array-like indexers and index objects. The function now properly handles list indexers and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
