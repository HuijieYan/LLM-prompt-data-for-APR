The buggy function `_get_with` is failing when the input `key` is not recognized as a valid type and the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred. The bug is likely caused by incorrect type checking and inconsistent handling of the `key` input. 

The bug can be fixed by improving the type checking logic and ensuring that the type of the `key` input is consistently handled throughout the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional type checking to handle various types of input for `key`. We also specifically check if `key` is a scalar value using the `is_scalar` function, and handle it accordingly. This should address the inconsistencies and type inference issues that were causing the bug.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
