The bug is in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The error message indicates that there is a problem when trying to retrieve values from the series using a specific key type, such as list, array, index, or series. The test fails, preventing this action, and raises a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` method uses various methods to handle different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and single values. There's a condition to check for non-list-like keys and handle them differently, but it's failing for certain key types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` method correctly handles the different key types and retrieves the values from the series without raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version, the `is_list_like` check is removed, and instead, we directly check if the key is a scalar using `is_scalar`. If it's a scalar, we use `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the value. If the key is not a scalar, we continue with the type inference and reindexing steps to retrieve the values based on the key type. This should fix the bug and make the function work correctly for all key types.
