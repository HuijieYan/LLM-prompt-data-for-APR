The issue with the buggy function seems to stem from the logic used to identify the type of the `key` variable. The function should correctly identify the type of the key each time and use that information to perform the operations.

An effective strategy for fixing the bug would be to implement a proper type check for the `key` variable and handle each type accordingly. This would involve checking if the key is a string, list, numpy array, etc., and then using the appropriate method based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected version, we perform type checks on the `key` variable and handle it accordingly. The code correctly identifies the type of the key and performs the appropriate action for each type. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing test cases.
