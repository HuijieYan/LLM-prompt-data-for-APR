There are a few potential error locations in the provided code.

1. The function is checking if the `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, which is not a valid type for indexing a Series.
2. The code checks if the `key` is a list or numpy array, but it doesn't handle the case where it might be an ExtensionArray or Index.
3. The function first checks if `key` is instance of `tuple` and then later checks if it's an instance of `list`, which can cause confusion and potential issues.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling all the possible types of indexing objects correctly, leading to potential errors and unexpected behavior when indexing a Series.

To fix the bug, we should handle all possible types of indexing objects properly and streamline the checks for different types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__ should handle this case
            raise TypeError("Boolean indexing is not supported")

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        # handle other cases, e.g. scalars
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for different types of keys and handle them accordingly, while also removing redundant checks for specific types within the `if` statements. Additionally, a specific error message is raised for boolean indexing to provide clear feedback.
