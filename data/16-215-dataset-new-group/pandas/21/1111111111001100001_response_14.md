The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the incorrect identification of the type of the key, which leads to the wrong behavior and fails the test cases. The input `key` can be of different types, such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series, and the function should handle each type appropriately. 

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the `key` using the `is_list_like` function, which checks if the input is list-like. Then, we can perform different operations based on the type of the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type

        return self.reindex(key)

    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function should handle different types of input `key` appropriately and pass the failing test cases.
