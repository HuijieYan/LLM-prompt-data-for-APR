The buggy function contains an error in the control flow logic that handles different types of keys. The bug causes the function to raise a KeyError when the input key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the different types of keys appropriately. Specifically, we need to correct the conditional checks and index access operations to ensure that the function behaves as expected for each type of input key.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we removed the redundant conditional checks for different types of keys and simplified the logic to handle list-like keys. Now, the function should behave as expected for all input key types.

To verify that the bug is fixed, we should run the failing tests again and ensure that they pass with the corrected _get_with function.
