The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class is causing issues with different types of indexers, specifically the `list` indexer. This bug is leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing values using list indexers, which is different from array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional checks within the `_get_with` function. The handling of different types of indexers is not consistent, especially when it comes to the `list` indexer, leading to different outcomes for array-like and list indexers.

In order to fix this bug, the conditional logic within the `_get_with` function needs to be revisited and modified to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers. Specifically, the conditional checks for `list` indexers need to be updated to provide the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With the updated function, the conditional checks are modified to provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers. The function handles list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is consistent and matches the expected outcomes for accessing values in the `Series` class.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the inconsistencies observed with list indexers and ensure that the bug is fixed.
