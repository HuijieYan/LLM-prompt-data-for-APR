## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` and return the corresponding result based on its type. However, the function fails to properly handle the case where `key` is a list. This causes the function to return inconsistent results and raises a `KeyError` in some cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle lists as input. When `key` is a list, it should be treated differently from other data types, such as a slice, DataFrame, or tuple. The function does not have a specific branch to handle lists, leading to inconsistent behavior and, ultimately, raised errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, add a specific branch in the function to handle lists as input. This branch should handle the case where `key` is a list and return the appropriate result. It should also ensure consistency in handling different types of input to avoid errors.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, a distinct branch was added to handle the list case as input. The function now checks if `key` is a list and returns the result accordingly, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of input. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub ticket.
