### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is trying to retrieve a value based on the provided `key`, which can be a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or list. The error messages from the failing test suggest that `_get_with` is not properly handling the indexing with a list-like object and is raising a `KeyError`.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are:
1. The conditional logic for handling scalar values is complex, leading to potential errors with list-like objects.
2. The condition to handle list indexers and reindexing might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely due to incorrect conditional logic for handling list-like objects or scalars, leading to the KeyError when trying to retrieve values based on the key.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Simplify the conditional branches related to dealing with list-like objects and scalars for better clarity.
2. Adjust the condition to handle list indexers and reindexing, ensuring it is correct and handles indexing with list-like objects properly.

### The corrected version
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            loc_key = self.index[key] if is_bool(key) else self.index.get_loc(key)
            return self._get_values_tuple(loc_key)
        elif key_type == "integerNA":
            key = key.tolist()
        elif key_type == "string":
            loc_key = self.index.get_loc(key)
            return self._get_values_tuple(loc_key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the conditional branches have been simplified to handle list-like objects and scalars more effectively. Additionally, the condition to handle list indexers and reindexing is adjusted to ensure it handles indexing with list-like objects properly.
