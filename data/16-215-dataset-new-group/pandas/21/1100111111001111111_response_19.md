The issue seems to be related to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers with the `Series` object. When using a list type indexer, the bug causes a KeyError to be raised even if the value is present in the index. This inconsistency is also seen when comparing the behavior of list indexers to array-like indexers and Index indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. We also need to make sure that the KeyError is not raised when the value is present in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list for consistency
    key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Treat this as a positional indexer when the index type is an integer or list
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where the key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, we ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers and that the KeyError is not raised in cases where the value is present in the index. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected across different types of indexers.
