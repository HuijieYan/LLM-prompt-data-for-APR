The bug in the _get_with function is that it does not handle the case when a list-like key is passed to the Series indexing. This leads to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers, such as pd.Index and np.array. The issue posted on GitHub also highlights this inconsistency and questions the reason behind it. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the _get_with function handles the list-like key correctly and consistently with other types of indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the _get_with function that addresses the bug and ensures consistent behavior with list-like indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key properly
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it now properly handles list-like keys and ensures consistent behavior with other types of indexers. This fix addresses the inconsistency pointed out in the GitHub issue and ensures that all types of indexers behave consistently in the Series indexing.
