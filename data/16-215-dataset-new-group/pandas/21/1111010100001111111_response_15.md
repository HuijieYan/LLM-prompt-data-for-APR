The issue arises from the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class within the pandas library. The function is intended to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, and others.

The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers. The issue on GitHub describes the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers, and it points out that the behavior for list indexers differs from other array-like indexers.

Looking at the runtime input/output variable values and the expected input/output variable values, it appears that the bug occurs when handling list-like indexers. The function is not correctly identifying the type of key, resulting in inappropriate handling for list indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list indexers to be consistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers. We also need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key being passed and handles it accordingly.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to correctly identify and handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # For list-like indexers, handle them consistently with other array-like indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we added `ensure_index(key)` to handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. We also retained the other conditional statements and ensured they correctly identify the type of the key being passed and handle it accordingly.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values for the test cases.
