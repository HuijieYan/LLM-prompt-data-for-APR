Based on the given information, the bug appears to be related to how the Series class handles different types of indexers. The issue mentions that the behavior of the `ser.loc[key]` method is inconsistent for different types of indexers and that there is a test which fails when trying to make all cases behave like the list case.

The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to how it handles different types of indexers and how it infers the `key_type`. It seems that there may be inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers, leading to the error described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `key_type` should be inferred correctly for different types of indexers, and the function should handle each type of indexer consistently to avoid the inconsistency described in the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self._get_value(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_list_like(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle different types of indexers separately and consistently, and we ensure that the `key` is always converted to a list-like object when necessary before inferring its type.

This should resolve the bug and provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
