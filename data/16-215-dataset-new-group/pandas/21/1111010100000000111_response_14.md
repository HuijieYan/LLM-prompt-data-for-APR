The issue describes inconsistency in the behavior of indexers when using a list index with no matches in a pandas Series. The example given shows that using different types of indexers results in different behavior when there are no matches in the Series.

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the way it handles different types of indexers and the inconsistency in behavior when using a list index with no matches.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers in a consistent manner, similar to the behavior of other indexers like arrays or Index objects. This involves updating the logic for handling list indexers and matching behavior to other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Use an Index object for consistent handling
    key_index = ensure_index(key)

    if key_index.empty or not self.index.isin(key_index).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if key_index.equals(self.index):
        return self

    return self.reindex(key_index)

``` 

In the corrected version, we use the `ensure_index` function to ensure that the list-like key is converted to an Index object for consistent handling. We then check if the key Index is empty or if none of its values are present in the Series index, and raise a KeyError if necessary. Finally, we handle the cases where the key Index is equal to the Series index or where a reindexing operation is needed. This should result in consistent behavior for list indexers when there are no matches in the Series.
