### Assessment and Bug Fix Strategy:

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is designed to be used by other functions within the class. The error occurs when the `ser[key]` operation does not raise a `KeyError` as expected. The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle the input `key` correctly in all cases.

The identified potential errors within the `_get_with` function are:
1. The handling of the `key` input variable when it is not a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple.
2. The differentiation in handling `key_type == integer`.
3. The handling of the `key` when it is a list.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Add conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to handle different types of `key`.
2. Use the appropriate methods to handle `key` based on its type and values.
3. Ensure that the function raises a `KeyError` when expected.

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function can be provided as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle other types of key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the issues identified and should ensure that the function properly handles different types of input `key`. This should result in the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` passing without raising a `KeyError`.
