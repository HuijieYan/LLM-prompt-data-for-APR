The bug in the function `_get_with` arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` input and the resulting `key_type`. The function is not properly handling the different types of inputs for `key`, which leads to errors in processing and returning the correct result.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the different types of `key` inputs, and appropriately identify the `key_type` to ensure that the function returns the expected result.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, Series)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the function first checks for specific types of `key` inputs and then handles them accordingly. It also correctly identifies the `key_type` based on the input, ensuring that the appropriate indexing operation is performed.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected results for different types of `key` inputs.
