The `test_getitem_no_matches` function is expecting a `KeyError` exception to be raised when an invalid key is used to access the `Series` object. However, it is not getting the expected `KeyError` exception. The failed test uses a variety of `box` types to specify the invalid key, but the problem is not likely due to the `box` parameter.

The code excerpt `_get_with(self, key)` is a method of the `Series` class. There are multiple conditions that check various properties of the supplied `key`. The issue may lie in the exact condition and its related error handling branch in the function `_get_with`. 

It could be assumed that the incorrect error is raised due to the final return statement inside `_get_with`. The function `reindex` should not be the correct error handling branch when `IndexError` occurs, so the problem could be lying there. We need to check the computer decision-making process and ensure that for an invalid `key`, the method raises a `KeyError` instead of an `IndexError` only, as was expected in the failing test.

We can update the condition that checks for an invalid `key` to raise a `KeyError` instead of trying to reindex. The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this corrected `_get_with` function, it should now properly raise a `KeyError` as expected by the failing test.
