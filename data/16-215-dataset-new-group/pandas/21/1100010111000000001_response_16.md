The problem with the current implementation of the `_get_with` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where the key is a list-like object. This causes the function to throw a KeyError when it should not. 

To fix this bug, we should modify the part of the function that deals with list-like keys to properly handle the situation where the key is a list. We can do this by first checking if the key is a list and then handling it accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):  # Check if the key is list-like
        key = list(key)  # Convert the key to a list

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
