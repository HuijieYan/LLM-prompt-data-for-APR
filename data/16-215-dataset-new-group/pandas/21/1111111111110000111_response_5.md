# Potential Error Locations
- The line `ser[key]` in the failing test indicates the usage of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class.
- The TypeError raised for `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` and invalid type checking in the remaining part of the function might also be potential culprits.

# Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by inconsistencies in how different indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. Specifically, list indexers are treated differently, leading to a KeyError when using a list indexer. This is consistent with the details mentioned in the GitHub issue.

# Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This will involve making all indexers, including list indexers, behave in the same way and return consistent results. The type checking logic should also be reviewed to ensure it accurately determines the type of key being used.

# Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers has been made consistent. All indexers, including list indexers, now return consistent results. Additionally, the type checking logic has been improved to correctly determine the type of key being used. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the `_get_with` function behave consistently for different types of indexers.
