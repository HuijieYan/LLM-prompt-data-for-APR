Based on the expected input and output values, it seems that the bug occurs when determining the key type within the `_get_with` function. The key type should be determined based on the input parameter `key`, and then the appropriate action should be taken based on that type. 

It seems that the bug may be caused by the way the key type is being inferred, and the incorrect handling of different types of keys. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly handle and infer the key type, and then execute the correct action based on that type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = type(key).__name__

    if key_type == "int":
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "DataFrame":
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the key type is determined using the `type(key).__name__` method, and then the appropriate action is taken based on the type. This approach ensures that the function handles different types of keys correctly and returns the expected values for different types.
