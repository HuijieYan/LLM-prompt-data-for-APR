The bug seems to be related to the determination of the `key_type`, which is used to decide whether to treat the input `key` as a positional indexer (self.iloc) or label-based (self.loc).

Based on the provided runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, it can be observed that the key_type is always determined as 'string' regardless of the actual input key type. This leads to the wrong behavior of the conditional blocks that depend on key_type, causing incorrect outputs for different types of keys.

To fix the bug, the key_type should be correctly determined based on the type of the input key. Additionally, the conditional blocks that depend on key_type should be carefully analyzed to ensure the correct behavior based on the type of the input key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, ABCDataFrame)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type is determined using the `lib.infer_dtype` function to infer the type of the input key. Additionally, the conditional blocks have been restructured to correctly handle different types of keys and ensure the appropriate behavior based on the key type.
