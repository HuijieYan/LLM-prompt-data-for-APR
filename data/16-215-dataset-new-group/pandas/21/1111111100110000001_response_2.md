The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the fact that the code is incorrectly using the `key_type` variable to determine how to index the Series. This has led to an incorrect indexing behavior and caused the failing test. 

To fix this bug, we need to revisit the logic used for determining the type of key and apply the appropriate indexing method based on that type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)

```

This correction simplifies the logic and uses the `loc` method for an array-like key and the `reindex` method for all other cases. This should address the bug and make the function behave correctly.
