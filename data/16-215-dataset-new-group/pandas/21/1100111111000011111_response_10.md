The buggy function `_get_with` seems to be failing in cases where the indexers are of type list, array, or pandas Series. The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in the behavior of indexers and invalid handling of the key_type variable. The bug arises from a discrepancy in the handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in the case of list indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers, and appropriately handle the key_type variable to prevent the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Ensure all indexers are converted to a list
    key = list(key) if not is_list_like(key) else key

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # If key_type is integer or boolean, use iloc, else use loc
    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function should now handle all types of indexers consistently and address the KeyError issue for list indexers.

This fix should also satisfy the expected input/output values and address the GitHub issue about the inconsistent behavior of list indexers.
