The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when handling a list-like key. The issue pointed out in the GitHub post suggests that the behavior of indexing with a list should be consistent across different input types. 

The `key_type` variable in the buggy function is expected to have the value "string" and type `str`. However, due to an incorrect implementation, it causes an inconsistency in the behavior when indexing with a list.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be applied:
- Ensure that the behavior of indexing with a list is consistent across different input types, as suggested in the GitHub issue. 
- Handle the list-like key in a manner that it aligns with the expected behavior and produces consistent results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list-like key
    key = np.asarray(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the list-like `key` is converted to a NumPy array using `np.asarray`. This ensures consistent behavior and aligns with the expected results. This fix addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and provides a solution for handling list-like keys in the `_get_with` function.
