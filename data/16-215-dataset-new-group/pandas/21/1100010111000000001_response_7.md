Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be caused by improper handling of the index type when a key doesn't match any values in the index. The function should return a `KeyError` in this case, but it is not implemented correctly.

Given this analysis, a potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to add a conditional statement to check if the key matches any values in the index and return a `KeyError` if it doesn't. This can be achieved using the `isin` method to check for matching values in the index.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if self.index.isin(key).any():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the case where the key doesn't match any values in the index and return a `KeyError` as expected.
