The issue with the buggy function seems to be with the detection of the data type of the key input. The variable `key_type` is being assigned the value `'string'` in all cases, which indicates that the code is not accurately determining the data type of the key input.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to improve the type detection for the `key` input variable, ensuring that it correctly identifies the data type of the input.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the code has been simplified to handle the different cases of the `key` input. It starts with the slice case, followed by the tuple and list case. If the input does not match any of these cases, it uses the `reindex` function to handle the key variable.
