The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue with handling list-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and raising KeyError when it should not. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches."

Looking at the failing tests, it's clear that the bug occurs when the indexer is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. The issue seems to be related to the handling of these indexers within the `_get_with` function.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the `is_list_like` condition not being handled correctly in the `_get_with` function, leading to KeyError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to properly handle the list-like indexers and avoid raising KeyError when it shouldn't. This can be achieved by adjusting the conditional statements and the way different indexers are handled within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```
The corrected version of the function provides proper handling for list-like indexers and avoids the inconsistent behavior and KeyError raised in the original code.

By implementing these fixes, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
