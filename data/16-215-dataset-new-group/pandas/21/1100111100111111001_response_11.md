The bug in the code is related to the incorrect handling of the input key parameter in the "_get_with" function when the key is a list, ndarray, or Index. The function does not handle these input types correctly, leading to a KeyError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to handle these input types properly. We should check if the key is a list, ndarray, or Index and handle each case accordingly. We can use the "isinstance" function to check the type of the key and then take the appropriate action based on the type.

Here's the corrected version of the "_get_with" function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_integer(key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the cases of input key being a list, ndarray, or Index by checking their types and then appropriately using "loc" or "reindex" based on the type of the key.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
