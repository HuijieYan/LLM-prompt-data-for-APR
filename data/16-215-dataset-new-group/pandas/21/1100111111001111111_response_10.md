The buggy function `_get_with` has different behavior for list indexers compared to array-like indexers, which is causing inconsistent results and failing tests. Here's the suggested strategy to fix the bug:

1. Update the `_get_with` function to treat list indexers similarly to array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior.
2. Review the handling of different types of indexers to ensure that they all return expected results.
3. Consider the GitHub issue's comments and attempts to make all indexers behave like the list case, and ensure that the test added in #5880 still passes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Treat list, np.ndarray, Index, and Series similarly for consistency
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function will treat list, np.ndarray, Index, and Series similarly, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
