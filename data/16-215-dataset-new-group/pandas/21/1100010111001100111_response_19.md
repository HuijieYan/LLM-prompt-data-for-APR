The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas/core/series.py` file is causing an inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers, leading to a `KeyError` when using a list indexer that does not occur with other types of indexers.

The main issue lies in the handling of list-like indexers, which is causing the `KeyError` to be raised in some cases. The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights this inconsistency and suggests making all cases behave like the list case. The test added in pull request #5880 demonstrates the difference in behavior.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition for handling list-like indexers and ensure that the behavior is consistent across all types of indexers. By allowing list-like indexers to behave similarly to other types, we can resolve the inconsistency and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated condition for handling list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the behavior of list-like indexers has been updated to match that of other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and preventing the `KeyError` from being raised in the failing test case. This fix aligns with the suggested strategy to ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers.
