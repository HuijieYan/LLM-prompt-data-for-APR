The bug in the `_get_with` function involves the handling of different types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing elements of a Series. The issue in the GitHub report demonstrates that the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with other types of indexers, leading to unexpected errors and different behavior in some cases.

The bug occurs when handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function, especially when the indexer type is not a recognized type or when reindexing is required. The function mistakenly treats a list indexer differently, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, and that reindexing behavior is applied uniformly regardless of the indexer type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) or (is_list_like(key) and not is_dict_like(key)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first handle slice indexers and tuples, then check if the key is a scalar or a non-dict-like list, and finally reindex for any other type of indexer. This approach ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and avoids unexpected errors.
