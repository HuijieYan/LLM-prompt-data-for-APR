It looks like the buggy function is designed to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values based on their type. The function also determines the type of the key and then performs specific operations based on the type.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the if-elif-else blocks, where the function checks the type of the input key and then returns specific values based on the type.

The cause of the bug might be related to the incorrect handling of the key type within the if-elif-else blocks, leading to unexpected return values.

To fix the bug, we can revise the handling of the key type within the if-elif-else blocks to ensure that the correct type-specific operations are performed.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, we made the following changes:
- We removed the redundant elif condition for non-indexable key types, as it is already covered by the is_list_like condition.
- We ensured that the key type is correctly determined and used to perform the corresponding operations based on the type.
- We made the code more concise and easier to read.
