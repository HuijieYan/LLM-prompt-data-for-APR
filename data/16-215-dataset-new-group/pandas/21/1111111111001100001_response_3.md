The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. Based on the failing test and the runtime values and types of the variables inside the function, it looks like the function is not correctly handling the case where the key is not found in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.

The bug appears to be specifically related to the handling of non-matching index keys, which results in a `KeyError` being raised.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should handle the case where the key is not found in the index. This can be achieved by adding a check for the existence of the key in the index before attempting to retrieve the value. If the key is not found in the index, an appropriate error message or default behavior should be provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"The key '{key}' is not found in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is in the index using `if key in self.index`, and if it is not found, we raise a `KeyError` with an appropriate error message. If the key is found, we proceed with the original logic to retrieve the value. This approach ensures that non-matching index keys are handled properly.

By making this change, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test.
