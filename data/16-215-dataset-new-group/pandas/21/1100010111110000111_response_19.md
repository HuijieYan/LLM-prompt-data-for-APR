The bug in the function `_get_with` is related to how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. When using a list indexer, the buggy function throws a `KeyError` and fails to handle the case when there are no matches in the index.

The issue stems from inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. When accessing a series using a list indexer, it results in a `KeyError`, while using other array-like indexers does not exhibit the same behavior. This inconsistency has been highlighted in the GitHub issue, with a suggestion to make the behavior consistent across all types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers with other array-like indexers, such as arrays and pandas index.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function `_get_with` will now handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, ensuring that it does not throw a `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index. This will address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and provide a more reliable behavior for indexers across different types.
