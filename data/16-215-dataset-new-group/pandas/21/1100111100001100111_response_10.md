The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, particularly lists. The function is not correctly handling the case when the key is a list and is returning the incorrect result or raising an error.

One potential cause of the bug is that the function is not effectively distinguishing between different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and indexes, leading to incorrect handling of the input.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to appropriately handle the different types of indexers, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the results. This might involve updating the logic for handling list-like key types and ensuring that the appropriate operations are performed for each type of indexer.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_arr = np.asarray(key)
        if is_bool(key_arr):
            return self.loc[key]
        if is_categorical_dtype(key_arr):
            return self.reindex(key)
        if is_extension_array_dtype(key_arr):
            return self.reindex(key)
        if is_integer(key_arr):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        if is_list_like(key_arr):
            return self.loc[key]
        raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported key type")
```

In the corrected version, we have added logic to handle different key types, such as scalars, arrays, and lists, and perform the appropriate operations accordingly. This should address the bug and ensure consistent and accurate results for different types of indexers.

This fix also aligns with the issue posted on GitHub, as it aims to provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers, addressing the inconsistency described in the issue.
