The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, when the key is a list, the function does not handle it correctly, resulting in a KeyError in some cases. The bug appears to be caused by inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are treated.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. This might involve modifying the logic for list-like indexers to align with the behavior of other types of indexers.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version aims to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, including list-like indexers. It should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing tests.
