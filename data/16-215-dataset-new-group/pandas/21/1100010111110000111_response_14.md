## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series. The failing tests are related to the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers.

## Identified Bug
The bug is identified in the function `_get_with` where it handles the case for a list-like key. It is not handling this case properly which causes inconsistencies in behavior, leading to failing tests and an inconsistent error message.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list-like keys properly, resulting in inconsistencies in behavior and error messages.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like key properly.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version properly handles the list-like key and ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers. This modification should resolve the issue and all related failing tests.
