The issue is related to the indexing behavior in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library. When using a list indexer with no matches, it is inconsistent and raises a KeyError, while other types of indexers handle this case differently. The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for this behavior.

The potential error locations within the `def _get_with` function are:
1. The handling of different types of indexers may be causing the inconsistency.
2. The specific condition for handling the list indexer may be causing the KeyError.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is treating list indexers differently and raising a KeyError when there are no matches. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers and the `ser.loc[key]` behavior.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to unify the behavior of different types of indexers so that they handle the case of no matches consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we unified the behavior for all types of indexers by attempting to use `self.loc[key]` for all types, and then falling back to `self.reindex(key)` if a KeyError is raised. This approach ensures consistent handling of no matches for list indexers and other types, addressing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
