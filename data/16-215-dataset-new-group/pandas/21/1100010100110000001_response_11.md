The 'ser[key]' operation is failing for the 'test_getitem_no_matches' of 'pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py' the error is that the 'KeyError' exception is not being raised when an invalid key is used to index the series. 

The 'ser' Series is created as 'Series(["A", "B"])' and the 'key' Series is created as 'Series(["C"], dtype=object)'. These are then used to index 'ser' which should raise a KeyError, but it is not raising as expected due to a bug in the '_get_with' method which is used when indexing a pandas Series. 

One potential location for the bug is in this section of the '_get_with' method:
```python
if isinstance(key, list):
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```
When the key is a list, it is trying to index using 'self.loc[key]', which could be causing the problem.

The cause of the bug is that the indexing logic within the '_get_with' method is not correctly handling the case when a key is a list or an array. It should be using the label-based indexing (self.loc) when the key is list-like. Instead, it is using positional-based indexing (self.iloc) for list-like keys which is leading to inconsistency and failing to raise a KeyError when it should.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the '_get_with' method to correctly handle list-like keys and use label-based indexing (`self.loc`) consistently for such cases.

Here's a corrected version of the '_get_with' method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the behavior of the '_get_with' method should align with the expected behavior and the failing test should pass successfully without raising KeyError.
