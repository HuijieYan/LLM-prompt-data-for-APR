The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior in handling list indexers compared to other indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is meant to check for consistent behavior when using different types of indexers, but the function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` in this case.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other indexers. The function `_get_with` checks for the type of the key, and if it's not a list-like object, it uses `self.loc[key]` to return the value. However, the behavior is different for list indexers, which causes the inconsistency.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function `_get_with` handles list indexers in the same way as other indexers, ensuring consistent behavior. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the function pass the failing test.
