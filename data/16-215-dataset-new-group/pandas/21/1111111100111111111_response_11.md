To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. It seems that the bug occurs when using a list-like indexer such as a Python list or pandas Series.

The issue seems to be in the conditional statements that handle different types of indexers. We should ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

Based on the failing test cases and the expected input/output values, it appears that the bug is related to the handling of list-like indexers. The expected behavior is to return `NaN` for indexers that do not match any values in the Series index, similar to the behavior when using other types of indexers.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to update the conditional statements to handle list-like indexers in a way that aligns with the expected behavior. This might involve treating list-like indexers similarly to other types of indexers, ensuring that the return value is consistent regardless of the indexer type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    # Handle all types of indexers uniformly
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional statements and handling list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected across different types of indexers.

This should address the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases.
