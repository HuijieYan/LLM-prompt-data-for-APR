The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of different input types in the `_get_with` function, resulting in an incorrect key_type. The key_type is expected to be 'integer' in one of the cases, but it wrongly evaluates to 'string' in all cases instead. This leads to incorrect indexing and, ultimately, the failed test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to properly identify the type of the 'key' input. Using the correct datatype of the 'key' input, we can then appropriately handle the different cases for indexing.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        # Verifying the type of 'key'
        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        elif is_categorical_dtype(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise TypeError(
                f"Key must be a slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, or np.ndarray. Got {type(key)}"
            )
```

By including type checks for different key types and appropriate handling for each case, the corrected function addresses the issues identified and should now pass the failing test cases.
