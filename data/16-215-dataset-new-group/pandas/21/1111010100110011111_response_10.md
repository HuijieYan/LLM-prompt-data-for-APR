The issue with the `_get_with` function lies in the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, particularly when using a list as an indexer. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is due to the inconsistent handling of list indexers as compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by updating the logic to handle list indexers in a manner similar to other types of indexers and ensuring that the behavior is consistent across all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when handling list indexers, we ensure that `key` is converted to a list if it is not already list-like. This will ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. Additionally, this fix should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
