The buggy function seems to have a bug related to the handling of the `key` parameter. It checks the type of the `key` parameter and then makes some decisions based on that type. However, there are some errors in handling different types of keys and inferring the `key_type`.

The bug appears to be related to the incorrect inference of the `key_type` and the consequent handling of the `key` parameter. This is evident from the fact that the output `key_type`, which is used to make decisions, is expected to be a string, but it is not calculated correctly in the current implementation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for inferring the `key_type` and then make sure to handle the `key` parameter appropriately based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle scalar values
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index types
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is inferred based on the `key` parameter and then used to make decisions on how to handle the `key` parameter. Additionally, the handling of scalar values and other types of keys is addressed to ensure proper functionality.
