The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, such as list, array-like, and pandas index. This inconsistency is leading to errors when trying to access items that are not present in the index.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access non-existent items with a list indexer.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with array-like and pandas index indexers to avoid the KeyError when trying to access non-existent items.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = [key]
        
        # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key] 
    else:  
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we add an additional condition to handle list-like indexers correctly and prevent the KeyError when trying to access non-existent items.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function will correctly handle list, array-like, and pandas index indexers, providing consistent behavior and resolving the KeyError issue.

This fix should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and make the `_get_with` function handle list-like indexers in the same consistent manner as other index types.
