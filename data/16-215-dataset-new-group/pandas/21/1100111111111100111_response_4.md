# The buggy function is failing to handle the case where a list-like key is provided for indexing the Series, resulting in a KeyError.
# The buggy function contains conditional statements to handle different types of keys, but it seems to be mishandling the list-like key.

The issue seems to be related to how the buggy function handles list-like keys, as indicated by the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the buggy function should be updated to handle list-like keys properly and consistently with other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_platform_int(key)  # Ensure key is integer type for consistent indexing

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        indexer = self._get_indexer(key)
        if indexer.ndim > 1:
            # Handle multi-dimensional array indexing, e.g., arr[[0], [1]]
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        return self._index_with(indexer)
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ABCSeries)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function ensures that the key is converted to an integer type if appropriate and then handles the indexing using `_index_with` or `_get_values_tuple` based on the type of the key. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
