## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The if-elif-else statement structure seems to only consider the case when `key` is a slice, an ABCDataFrame, a tuple, or not list-like. It does not handle the case when `key` is a list, ndarray, or an Index type.
2. The check for list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index types is not well-defined and may be causing issues in the logic flow.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug
The buggy function is failing to handle the case when `key` is a list or ndarray correctly. This is causing the KeyError to be raised when trying to access elements of the series using a list indexer. The GitHub issue also points out the inconsistent behavior when using different indexers.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by updating the logic to handle list, ndarray, and Index type indexers correctly. This would involve proper checks and handling for these types to ensure consistent behavior across different indexers.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if is_categorical_dtype(key):
            if not is_scalar(key):
                key = key[0]
        return self._where(key, drop=False)
    else:
        key = self.index._convert_list_indexer(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds additional checks to handle list, ndarray, and Index type indexers correctly, ensuring consistent behavior across different indexers.
