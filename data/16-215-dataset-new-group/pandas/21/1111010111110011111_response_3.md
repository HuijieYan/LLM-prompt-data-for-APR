The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling list-like indexers correctly, causing it to fail in the test cases when a list is used as an indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when a list is used as an indexer, resulting in a KeyError when the `reindex` method is called.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like indexers and avoid raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle list-like indexers correctly and pass the failing test cases.
