The cause of the bug is due to inconsistent behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers when used with the `Series` class. The issue on GitHub explains that `ser[list(key)]` raises an error, while other types of indexers do not. In addition, `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all 4 cases, indicating an inconsistency in behavior.

The bug is likely caused by the conditional checks and the handling of different indexer types within the `_get_with` function. The incorrect handling of list-like key types and array-like key types, as well as the inconsistency with `ser.loc[key]`, are contributing factors to the bug.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that all types of indexers behave consistently and do not raise errors unnecessarily. We should also address the specific issue mentioned in the GitHub issue, which is the inconsistency between using `ser[list(key)]` and other types of indexers.

To resolve this issue, a corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            if all(i in self.index for i in key):
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
```

This corrected version of the function includes handling for the case where the key is a list or array-like type. It ensures that if the key is empty, it returns a reindexed series without raising an error. If the key contains elements, it checks if all elements are present in the index and raises a KeyError if not. This behavior addresses the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
