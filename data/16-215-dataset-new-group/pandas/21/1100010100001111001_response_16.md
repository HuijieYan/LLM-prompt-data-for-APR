The buggy function is designed to handle different types of input keys, including slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, extension arrays, series, and indexes. The function is expected to determine the type of the key and take a specific action based on this type. However, there are multiple issues with the current implementation based on the analysis provided.

The input parameter `key` can be of different types such as list, ndarray, and Index. However, the function does not consistently handle these different types. For instance, when checking the type of the key, there is an additional check for `not is_list_like(key)`, which creates a branch for scalars that may not be recognized as scalars. This indicates a potential inconsistency in handling the key types.

Based on the provided analysis, during the execution of the failing tests, the `key_type` variable is consistently assigned the value `'string'`, irrespective of the actual key type. This indicates that there is an issue in the logic of inferring the key type within the function.

To fix the buggy function, the key type should be inferred using a reliable method that accurately determines the type of the input key, and the subsequent actions should be based on this inferred type. Additionally, the function should ensure consistent handling of different key types to cover all possible scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the key type is inferred using the `lib.infer_dtype` method, and the subsequent actions are based on this inferred type. Additionally, the function consistently handles different key types to cover all possible scenarios.
