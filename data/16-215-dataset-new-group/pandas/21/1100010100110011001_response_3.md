The bug in the provided function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the input `key` in various conditions. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. In the initial part of the function, the code is checking the type of `key` to determine how it should be accessed. However, there is a specific error message for a DataFrame type, but it's not properly handled. This could lead to potential errors when accessing a Series with a DataFrame type.

2. The function uses the variable `key_type` to determine the type of the `key`, but it doesn't handle all the cases properly and may lead to incorrect inference of the key type.

To fix the bug, we need to:
- Properly handle the case when the `key` is a DataFrame type.
- Improve the logic for determining the type of the `key` to ensure it is correctly inferred.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):  # Properly handle DataFrame type
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):  # Added handling for non-list-like types
        return self.loc[key]

    # Improved logic for determining the type of key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is a list or other types
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these corrections, the function should now properly handle different types of `key` inputs and match the expected values and types for the given test cases.
