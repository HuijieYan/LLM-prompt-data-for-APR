The buggy function `_get_with` contains a logic issue in handling indexers, particularly when it comes to list indexers. The issue is explained further in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`, which raises a `KeyError` when trying to index using a list indexer. This inconsistency is also related to a GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]", which points out that there is an inconsistent behavior in handling list indexers as compared to other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, the logic for list indexers needs to be updated to be consistent with other types of indexers. This may involve modifying the condition for handling list indexers and ensuring that it aligns with the behavior of other indexers.

The corrected version of the function `_get_with` is provided below:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle all kinds of indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the condition for handling non-list indexers has been modified to ensure that the indexing behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. This should address the inconsistency and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
