The bug in the buggy function is likely causing an issue with indexing and returning the correct values based on the input key. The bug seems to be related to the type of key and how it is handled within the function. The input key is not being processed correctly, leading to errors in the output.

A potential strategy to fix the bug could involve ensuring that the key is correctly identified and processed based on its type, and the appropriate indexing method (e.g., loc or iloc) is used to retrieve the values.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case when the input key is a scalar using `is_scalar` to check its type, and then convert it to a list. This should ensure that the key is correctly processed and the appropriate indexing method is used to retrieve the values.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now be able to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
