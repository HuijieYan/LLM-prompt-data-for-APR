Given the runtime input/output variable values and the GitHub issue information, it appears that the bug is occurring due to the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function fails to handle the case when a list indexer is used for indexing a Series. This inconsistency in behavior is causing the function to raise errors or return unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when a list indexer is used. This can be achieved by ensuring that list-like indexers are properly handled and that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index if it's not already an Index
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is a slice or a DataFrame, and handle them accordingly. Then, we check if the key is list-like using the `is_list_like` function. If it is, we convert the key to an Index using the `ensure_index` function to ensure consistent behavior, and then reindex the Series with the modified key.

This modification should address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves correctly for list-like indexers.

With this updated function, the bug should be resolved and the function should handle different types of indexers consistently, as per the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
