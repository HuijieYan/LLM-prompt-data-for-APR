The cause of the bug is that the code is not handling the case where the key is a list or an ndarray correctly. The variable `key_type` is set to the string value `'string'` in all the cases, indicating that the code is not correctly identifying the type of the input key.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic to correctly identify the type of the key. Instead of checking for a list or ndarray at the end, we should check for it at the beginning and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the input key correctly and pass the failing tests.
