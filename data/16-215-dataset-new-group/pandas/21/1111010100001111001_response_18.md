## Buggy function analysis
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of keys and return the corresponding values from the Series object. It defines various conditions to check the type of the input `key` and then returns the desired value based on a set of checks. However, the function is not handling the case of a list input correctly and has a redundant code block.

## Bug in the function
The bug occurs at the following code block in the function:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)

if isinstance(key, Index):
    key_type = key.inferred_type
else:
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```
In this block, the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` is checking if `key` is not an instance of any of the specified types and then converting it into a list. The subsequent condition `if isinstance(key, Index)` will never be satisfied after the conversion, leading to an incorrect value of `key_type`.

## Solution strategy
To fix the bug, the unnecessary type checking and conversion should be removed. Additionally, the conditions for different input types should be handled separately to ensure appropriate handling of the keys.

## Corrected function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )

        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
                #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]

            if isinstance(key, list):
                # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
                return self.loc[key]

            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid key type")
```
In the corrected function, the unnecessary type checking and conversion of the `key` variable have been removed. The conditions for different types of input have been categorized separately to ensure correct handling. Additionally, an overall else condition has been added to raise an error for any other invalid key type.

This corrected function will now handle different types of input keys correctly, producing the expected results.
