The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is not a list-like object. This causes a KeyError to be raised incorrectly when indexing a Series with a non-list-like object. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the `key` parameter is list-like, and if not, handle the indexing appropriately. We can also remove unnecessary type checks and convert the `key` to a list before the reindexing operation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):  # handle Index and Series
            key = key.tolist()
        else:  # handle scalars and non-list-like objects
            key = [key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the `key` is list-like using the `is_list_like` function. If it is not list-like, we handle special cases by converting the `key` to a list. Then we call the `reindex` function with the modified `key`.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test cases pass.
