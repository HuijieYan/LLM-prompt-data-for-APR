## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The error may be due to the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.
2. The calls to the `is_list_like` function might not be correctly identifying list-like objects.
3. The conditional statements for different types of indexers or key may be incorrect.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of key inputs but may not be correctly identifying list-like objects or array-like indexers. This leads to inconsistent behavior and error messages when trying to access elements in the Series using different types of indexers.

The corresponding GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The test added in the GitHub issue is failing, indicating that the behavior of the function is inconsistent.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the conditional statements for different types of indexers, the identification of list-like objects, and how the error messages are being handled.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the conditional statements for different types of indexers should be reviewed to ensure they correctly identify list-like objects and array-like indexers. Error handling for different types of indexers should also be reviewed and made consistent.

Additionally, the behavior of the function with different types of indexers should be aligned to provide consistent results and error messages.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)

        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() and self.index.inferred_type == 'integer':
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_bool(key):
        # boolean Index
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
