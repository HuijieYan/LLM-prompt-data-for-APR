The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to the handling of list indexers. It seems that list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raised errors. This discrepancy is evident in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The bug is likely occurring in the logic that handles different types of indexers, specifically when the key is a list. The issue seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers, leading to the raised KeyError and inconsistent behavior in the `ser.loc[key]` operation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Fix the inconsistency for list indexers
    if lib.is_scalar(key_type) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

In this corrected version, we've added additional checks for list indexers to ensure their consistent handling with other types of indexers, addressing the raised KeyError and inconsistent behavior.
