The bug in the provided function is that it fails to handle the case where the key is not found in the index. Instead of gracefully handling this situation, it raises a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to catch and handle the KeyError when attempting to access the item with the given key. If the key is not present in the index, we should return a value indicating that the key was not found.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return None
```
