The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the incorrect inference of the `key_type` variable. Since the error messages indicate that the function is not properly handling the key input when accessing an element of the Series, it is likely that the bug is related to the way the function determines the type of the `key`.

The function needs to accurately determine the type of the `key` input and handle it accordingly to avoid the error. The bug is likely to be in the logic that determines the `key_type` based on the type of the `key`.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately determine the type of the `key` input using appropriate methods based on the input's data type and ensure that it handles the different types correctly in the subsequent logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that we check for scalar `key` using the `is_scalar` function and handle it appropriately. Additionally, we verify the type of the `key` input using `isinstance` and accurately determine the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` and handle it accordingly in the subsequent logic. This should address the issue and make the function handle different types of `key` inputs correctly, passing the failing tests.
