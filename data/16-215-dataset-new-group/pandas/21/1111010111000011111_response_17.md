To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue raised in the GitHub post and ensure that the function behaves consistently regardless of the indexer type used.

The issue described in the GitHub post highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, and there's a specific test case where the behavior is inconsistent. The goal is to address this inconsistency and make the function behave consistently for all types of indexers.

From the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the way the function handles the key when it is a list. In the failing test case, a list indexer leads to a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is a list, and if so, we directly use `self.loc[key]`. This ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test and behave consistently for different types of indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub post and satisfying the expected input/output values.
