The bug is related to the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of the pandas library. The issue arises when the function is called with a list-like indexer, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to array-like or Index indexers. This is causing a test to fail with a `KeyError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. The failing test is due to the fact that when the `ser[key]` operation is performed, instead of returning `NaN` as in other cases, it raises a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling list indexers needs to be updated to align with the behavior of array-like or Index indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fixed version handles all types of indexers consistently and should pass the failing test.
