The cause of the bug is that the variable `key_type` is not being set correctly, leading to unexpected behavior in the subsequent conditional statements that rely on it.

The `key_type` variable is used to determine the type of the `key` parameter that is being passed to the `_get_with` function. However, based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters, it seems that the `key_type` variable is always being set to `'string'` regardless of the actual type of the `key` parameter.

To fix this bug, the `key_type` variable needs to be updated to accurately reflect the type of the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Update the key_type based on the type of key
    if is_list_like(key):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = 'unknown'

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` variable is updated based on the actual type of the `key` parameter. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the conditional statements in the function behave as expected.
