To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, it's important to consider the different scenarios that are being checked for and to ensure that the correct behavior is applied in each case. Based on the runtime input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it's clear that the bug is related to how a list accessor is handled in comparison to other types of indexers.

The bug occurs when a list-like key is used and the behavior is not consistent with other types of indexers. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected errors, as demonstrated by the GitHub issue where the `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases.

To fix the bug, the behavior for list-like indexers should be made consistent with other types of indexers, and the correct key type should be inferred based on the type of indexer being used.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not supported"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Infer the key type based on the type of indexer
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        # Decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks for DataFrame and tuple indexers and raises a TypeError if either of these types is used. Then, it proceeds to handle the list-like indexers, infers the key type, and applies the correct indexing behavior based on the key type. This approach ensures consistent and expected behavior for all types of indexers, addressing the issue presented in the GitHub report.
