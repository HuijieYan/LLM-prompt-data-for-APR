The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `Series` class when trying to access non-existent values. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior when accessing non-existent values. This is evident from the failing test case which expects the same behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series, but the behavior is different for the list case.

To fix this bug, the strategy is to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, whether it's a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, when trying to access non-existent values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_iterator(key):
        key = [key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we have removed the specific checks for different types of indexers and have instead used more generic checks like `is_list_like` and `is_iterator` to treat all types of indexers consistently. This should resolve the inconsistency in behavior when accessing non-existent values using different types of indexers.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
