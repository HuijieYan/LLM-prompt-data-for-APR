Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function arises from a difference in behavior when indexing with a list compared to indexing with other array-like objects. This inconsistency results in a `KeyError` when indexing with a list, while the other array-like objects do not raise an error.

The cause of this bug is related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when dealing with a list-type indexer. The function treats list indexers differently, leading to a `KeyError` when accessing the `loc` attribute using a list-type indexer.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to treat list-type indexers in the same way that other array-like indexers are treated, to maintain consistency in behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self._get_values_series(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self._get_values_array(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if the `key` is an instance of a Series, Index, list, np.ndarray, or ExtensionArray, and then calls the corresponding method to handle the indexing operation.

This change ensures that all array-like indexers, including lists, are treated consistently and should fix the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing test cases.

By making these modifications, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the inconsistency and pass the failing test cases, resolving the GitHub issue.
