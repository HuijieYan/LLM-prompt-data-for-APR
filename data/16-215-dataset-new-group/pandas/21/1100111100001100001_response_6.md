The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the `key_type` variable. In all cases, `key_type` is being set as a string, which is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that `key_type` is being incorrectly inferred as a string when it should be inferred based on the type of the input `key`. This is leading to the incorrect behavior within the conditionals that follow.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the type of `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the input `key` type. We can achieve this by using appropriate type inference methods based on different types of input `key`, such as list, numpy array, Index, etc. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Infer the type of key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise NotImplementedError("Key type not recognized")
```

In the corrected version, after handling the specific cases of slice, DataFrame, and tuple keys, we infer the type of the key using `lib.infer_dtype`. This will correctly determine the type of the key, allowing the subsequent conditionals to behave as expected. Additionally, I have included a catch-all `raise NotImplementedError` statement at the end to handle cases where the key type is not recognized.
