The issue here is that when using a list as an indexer in the `ser[key]` call, it raises a KeyError, while using other types such as pd.Index(key) or np.array(key) does not raise an error.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement `elif not is_list_like(key)` should handle all non-list-like cases, but it also gets executed when `key` is a list. This leads to incorrect behavior when `key` is a list.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `key` is a list separately from other non-list-like cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle the case when key is a list separately from other non-list-like
    # cases
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling the case when `key` is a list separately and returning `self.loc[key]`, we fix the bug and ensure consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer used. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
