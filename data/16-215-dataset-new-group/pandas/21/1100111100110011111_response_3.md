To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue with the list case where `ser.loc[key]` raises a KeyError. The problem seems to be related to treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditional statements and handling list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list indexers are converted to an Index using `ensure_index`, we can handle all types of indexers uniformly and resolve the inconsistency in behavior. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
