The bug is likely related to the key_type variable being incorrectly inferred as 'string' in all cases. This would lead to the incorrect execution of the corresponding if-else statements, resulting in unexpected behavior and potentially raising errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is inferred correctly based on the type of key being passed to the _get_with function. Additionally, we should examine whether the behavior of different indexers (array-like, list) is consistent and whether there is a compelling reason for the differences.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_with function that takes into account the key_type inference and ensures consistent behavior for indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the key_type is inferred correctly based on the type of key being passed, and the behavior of different indexers is consistent. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all input cases.
