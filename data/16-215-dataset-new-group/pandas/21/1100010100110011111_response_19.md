Based on the error messages and expected input/output values, the bug in the provided function is that it is not handling the `list` type properly when used as an index. The function is expected to handle `list` type indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, such as `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. This discrepancy leads to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError when using a `list` type indexer.

The `key` parameter is expected to be an array-like type, such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. The expected behavior for all of these types is to return a result without raising a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function should treat the `list` type indexer in the same way as it treats other array-like indexers, such as `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. This can be achieved by handling the `list` type as an array-like indexer and avoiding the KeyError when using a `list` type indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should behave consistently for all array-like indexers, including `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, and should not raise a KeyError.
