The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior and KeyError exceptions. The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights this inconsistency, particularly in the behavior of the `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]` cases.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function. It mishandles different types of indexers, resulting in KeyError exceptions for list indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner. This means ensuring that the behavior for list indexers aligns with the behavior for other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case and reindex as needed
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers, including list indexers, are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function, addressing the inconsistencies and key errors reported in the GitHub issue.

By updating the conditional logic and handling list indexers in the same manner as other array-like indexers, the corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
