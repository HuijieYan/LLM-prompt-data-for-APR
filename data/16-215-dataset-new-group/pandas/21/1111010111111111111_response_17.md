The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling certain types of indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and errors when using list-like indexers. The function needs to be fixed to handle different types of indexers consistently and prevent the KeyError raised in the failing tests.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list-like indexers properly, resulting in errors when using certain types of indexers such as lists, arrays, and Index objects.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list-like indexers consistently and prevent the KeyError that is being raised in the failing tests. This can be achieved by updating the logic for handling different types of indexers in a more consistent and robust manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not supported"
        )
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This version of the function handles different types of indexers consistently by checking if the key is an ABCDataFrame or a tuple, and raising a TypeError in those cases. If the key is list-like, it uses `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the values, otherwise it falls back to `self.reindex(key)`.

With this corrected version, the function will handle different types of indexers consistently and prevent the KeyError raised in the failing tests. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
