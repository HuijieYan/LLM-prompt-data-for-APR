To fix the buggy function `_get_with`, we can modify the conditional statement for the case when `key` is not a list-like object. The `else` block following the `elif not is_list_like(key)` statement should be updated. We can use the `self.loc` method to extract the value directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]  # Updated this line to directly use self.loc

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This change ensures that the correct behavior for scalar key lookup is achieved within the `_get_with` function.

The fix involves modifying the conditional flow to correctly handle the scalar key lookup case by using `self.loc[key]` directly.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior for scalar key lookups.
