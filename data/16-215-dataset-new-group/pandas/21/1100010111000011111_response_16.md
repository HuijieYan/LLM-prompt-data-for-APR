The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of indexers. The function checks for the type of the `key` parameter and based on the type, it tries to perform various operations. However, for the case of a list-like key, it does not handle the indexing correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of key inputs, as reported in the GitHub issue. Specifically, when using a list as the key, it results in an unexpected `KeyError`, while other types of key inputs work as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the list-like key input correctly and consistently with other types of key inputs.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I've added an explicit check for a list-like key input and ensured that it is handled appropriately by using `self.loc[key]`. This change should resolve the inconsistent behavior and the `KeyError` when using a list as the key input.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It should also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
