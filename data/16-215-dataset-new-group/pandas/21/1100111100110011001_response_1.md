The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely occurring because the logic to determine the `key_type` and handle the respective cases is incorrect, leading to the KeyError in the failing test. The function is incorrectly handling different types of keys, such as boolean, integer, list, and ndarray.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correctly determining the `key_type` and handling the different cases based on the type of key. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the key does not exist in the index and raise a KeyError accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, (bool, np.bool_)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have rearranged the "if" conditions to handle different types of keys more precisely. Additionally, I have added a check for the existence of the keys in the index and raise a KeyError if the keys are not present in the index.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
