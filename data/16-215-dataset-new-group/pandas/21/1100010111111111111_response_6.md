The issue seems to be related to inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled by the `ser[key]` operation. The failing test case is specifically targeting the behavior for a list indexer, which is not consistent with the behavior for other indexer types such as array-like indexers or Index indexers.

The bug seems to be located in the conditional statements for handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the behavior for a list indexer appears to be inconsistent compared to other indexers, leading to a key error in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements for handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function should be reviewed and revised to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle the list-like indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list-like indexers consistently and revising the conditional statements, the corrected version should address the inconsistency and resolve the key error in the failing test case.
