The bug is caused by inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, the function fails to return the expected result and raises a `KeyError`. This inconsistency is also mentioned in the GitHub issue, where it is noted that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all 4 cases.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle the list indexer case consistently with other indexers. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for handling list indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key_arr = key.array
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_arr = np.asarray(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_arr, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we appropriately handle the `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and `List` cases. Additionally, we make the logic consistent with handling whether to use `loc` or `iloc`. This updated logic should resolve the inconsistency and address the issue reported on GitHub.
