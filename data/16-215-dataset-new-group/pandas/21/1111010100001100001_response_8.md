The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to stem from the conditional logic attempting to identify the type of `key` and corresponding actions to take. The function is not properly identifying the type of `key` and is not returning the appropriate result based on its type.

To fix the bug, we should change the conditional logic to more accurately identify the type of `key` and return the appropriate result for each type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (Series, Index, np.ndarray, list, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError("Invalid key type: {}".format(type(key).__name__))
```

This corrected version handles each type of `key` separately and returns the appropriate result based on its type. Additionally, an `else` block is added to catch any other unknown key types and raise an error.
