The issue seems to be related to the behavior of different indexers (list, array-like, and Index) when used with the `Series` object. The error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" indicates that the bug may be related to how the list indexer is being treated differently from the other indexers.

Based on the runtime information, it seems that the key type is incorrectly identified as 'string' in all cases, which might be causing the bug.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to handle the list indexer similarly to the other indexers and ensure consistent behavior across different indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key to a list
    
    # Convert key to list and handle Index case
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    # Handle all the key types uniformly
    if is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we convert the scalar key to a list if it's not list-like. We also handle the Index case by converting it to a list. This ensures that all key types are uniformly handled, which should fix the bug and make the behavior consistent across different indexers.
