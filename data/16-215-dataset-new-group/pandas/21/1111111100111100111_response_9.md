The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case when a list-like key is used for indexing a Series. This results in KeyError being raised, which is not consistent with the behavior of using other indexers such as pd.Index, np.array, or pd.Series.

The cause of the bug lies in the conditional checks for different types of key:

1. If the key is a list-like object, the code incorrectly tries to convert it to a list, which is incorrect.
2. The key_type is inferred incorrectly as 'string' for all cases, which may affect the subsequent logic in the function.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the conversion of key to a list when it is not list-like.
2. Fix the inference of the key_type based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Return the result of loc if the key is not list-like
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        # Infer the type of the key based on its data type
        if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
            key_type = 'array'
        elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            key_type = 'array'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the special case of a duplicate indexing
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # If none of the above conditions match, reindex the Series
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys including list-like objects, ensuring consistent behavior across various types of indexers and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
