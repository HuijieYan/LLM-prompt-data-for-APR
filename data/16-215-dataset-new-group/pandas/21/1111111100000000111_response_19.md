It looks like the bug is related to handling indexers differently for array-like indexers and list indexers. The issue on GitHub highlights that the behavior of `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]` is inconsistent. The issue also mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, indicating that indexers are not being handled consistently.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are around the handling of different types of indexers, especially with the `if` condition that checks for a list-like key.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like keys consistently, leading to inconsistencies in behavior when indexing the Series.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be updated to handle list-like keys consistently, regardless of whether they are array-like or list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = ensure_platform_int(self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem"))
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I made sure that the function consistently handles list-like keys by adding a check for `is_list_like(key)` and returning `self.loc[key]` when `key` is not array-like. This should resolve the inconsistency in behavior when indexing the Series with different types of indexers.
