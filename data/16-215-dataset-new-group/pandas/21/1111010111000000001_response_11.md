The potential error location in the _get_with function is that it does not handle the case when the key is an ndarray or a list properly. It's trying to reindex the series with the key, but not taking into consideration that reindexing with an array or list may not match any of the existing index values.

The cause of the bug is that the _get_with function doesn't correctly handle indexing with an ndarray or list, leading to a KeyError when trying to access values from the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the key is an ndarray or a list, and if it is, handle it differently by converting it to a list of index labels and then using these labels for indexing the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        labels = ensure_index(key)
        return self.loc[labels]

    elif not isinstance(key, (Index, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
The behavior of the original function has been preserved, and the handling of ndarray and list keys has been improved to properly retrieve the values from the Series using index labels.
