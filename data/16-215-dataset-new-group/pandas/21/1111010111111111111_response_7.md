The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the indexers in the Series class. The failing test cases indicate that when using certain types of indexers (list, array-like, Index), the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation is inconsistent, with the list indexer causing a KeyError while the others do not.

Looking at the code inside the `_get_with` function, it seems that the conditional checks for the type of the key are not handling the different types of indexers correctly. Specifically, the handling of list-like key types appears to be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of key indexers are properly handled and that the behavior is consistent across them.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        # Convert the series to a list before proceeding
        key = key.tolist()
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that if the key is an instance of a Series, it is converted to a list before being passed to the `loc` method. This should ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers and fix the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.

With this correction, the behavior of the `_get_with` function should align with the expected input/output values, and it should resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
