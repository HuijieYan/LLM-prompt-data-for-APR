The buggy function `_get_with` has an error in the code block that checks if the key is a list. Specifically, the issue is with the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block. The function tries to return `self.loc[key]`, assuming that the key is not list-like. However, the failing test indicates that this assumption is incorrect, and it causes the function to raise a KeyError with incorrect information.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the `key` variable when it is a list-like input. It incorrectly assumes that the input is not list-like and attempts to use `self.loc[key]`, which raises a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle list-like input correctly and use `self._get_values_tuple(key)` for tuple input.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the fixed version, the function checks if the key is list-like using `is_list_like(key)` and calls `self._get_values_tuple(key)` for a list-like input. Otherwise, it uses `self.reindex(key)` for non-list-like input, which resolves the KeyError issue.

This correction ensures that the function handles list-like input correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
