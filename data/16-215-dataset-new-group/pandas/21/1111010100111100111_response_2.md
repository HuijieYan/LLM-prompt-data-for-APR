The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a key error when using a list as an indexer with a series. This issue stems from the inconsistent behavior in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The bug results in a type error when accessing the Series with a list-like key. The input parameters of the buggy function and the runtime values and types illustrate the issue by showing that the key_type is incorrectly set to 'string' in each case, resulting in the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The key_type should be inferred correctly, and the appropriate indexing method should be used based on the key_type. Additionally, the bug should be fixed in such a way that it aligns with the behavior expected by the test case described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected version addresses the inconsistencies in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers and correctly infers the key_type. It also handles the key_type appropriately and aligns with the behavior expected by the test case described in the GitHub issue.
