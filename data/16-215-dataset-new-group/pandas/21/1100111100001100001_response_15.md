The bug in the function is that it incorrectly identifies the data type of the input 'key' in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

The function uses a series of conditionals to determine the type of 'key' and then proceeds with different actions based on that determination. However, the inference of the data type using lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False) seems to be inaccurate, resulting in the wrong actions being taken.

To fix this bug, we can modify the way the data type of the 'key' variable is inferred and then adjust the subsequent actions accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(ensure_index(key), skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the inferred data type is obtained using `lib.infer_dtype(ensure_index(key), skipna=False)` to ensure accuracy. Also, the conditionals are adjusted to consider the correct data type inferred and perform the corresponding actions.
