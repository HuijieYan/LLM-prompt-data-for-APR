# The issue in the buggy function:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` contains an error in the logic for handling different types of indexers. The function incorrectly handles the case when the key is a list, leading to inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling list indexers should be modified to ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers. The function should correctly handle the case when the key is a list and ensure that it behaves as expected in all scenarios mentioned in the GitHub issue.

# Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers to ensure consistent behavior
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Rest of the logic
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Determine whether to treat this as a positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected version of the function ensures that the handling of list indexers is consistent with other types of indexers. It addresses the issue described in the GitHub report and aligns the behavior with the expected input/output values for all cases.
