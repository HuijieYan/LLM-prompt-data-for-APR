The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the logic handling different types of indexers inconsistently, leading to unexpected behavior and errors during indexing. The GitHub issue also highlights an inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `_get_with` function needs to be revised to handle different types of indexers consistently and address the inconsistency raised in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling different types of indexers is revised to ensure consistent behavior. Specifically, string indexers are handled in the same way as tuple indexers by calling `_get_values_tuple`. Additionally, the logic for handling list-like and other indexers is also updated to address the inconsistency raised in the GitHub issue.

This should resolve the bug and provide the expected behavior for the cases listed.
