## Analysis and Bug Identification
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to retrieve values from the Series using different types of indexers. The bug arises from the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

## Potential Error Locations
The bug may be related to how different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) are handled inside the `_get_with` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug causes inconsistent behavior for retrieving values from the Series using list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to unexpected errors and behavior.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
The strategy to fix this bug involves unifying the behavior of different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) within the `_get_with` function. By ensuring a consistent approach to handling all types of indexers, the bug can be resolved.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key checks for list-like types are combined with array-like types, and the handling of scalar key values is explicitly checked. This unifies the behavior for different types of indexers and should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
