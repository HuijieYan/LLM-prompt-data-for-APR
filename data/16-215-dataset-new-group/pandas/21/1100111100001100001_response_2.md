The buggy function, `_get_with`, is intended to return a specific value from the Series based on the input key. However, there seem to be issues with how the key type is being inferred within the function, leading to incorrect outcomes.

Looking at the provided runtime input/output values for the buggy function:
Cases 1, 2, and 3 all have a key type of 'string' right before the function's return, which is inaccurate.

There are several potential error locations within the buggy function, but the main issue seems to be the incorrect inference of the key type, which then results in the wrong action being taken. This could be due to the key being checked for different types before the type is properly inferred.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred. One approach would be to use a more robust method for inferring the key type based on the input, ensuring that the correct type is identified and used to determine the action to be taken.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the key type is inferred using `lib.infer_dtype`, which should provide a more accurate representation of the type of key being used for indexing. This should resolve the issue of incorrect action based on the key type.
