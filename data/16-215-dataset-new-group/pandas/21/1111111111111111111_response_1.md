The issue seems to be related to the behavior of different indexers with Series, specifically the inconsistency when using list indexers. It appears that there is a KeyError when using a list indexer, while other types of indexers work as expected.

The buggy function `_get_with` is likely responsible for the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers. It is failing to handle the list type of indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers. Specifically, the key should be checked for its type and processed accordingly. 

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is as follows:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```
This corrected version should handle list indexers in a consistent way with other indexers, resolving the issue with the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
