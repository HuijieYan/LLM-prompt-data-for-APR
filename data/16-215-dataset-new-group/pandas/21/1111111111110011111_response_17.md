To fix the bug in the `_get_with()` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how different indexers are handled. The issue is related to the behavior of list indexers versus array-like indexers. The test cases show that using `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError`, while using other types of indexers does not.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the list indexer correctly, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to access a non-existent index.

To resolve this issue, we should update the function to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers and ensure that the correct indexer is used to retrieve the values from the series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, (slice, abc.Iterable)):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        else:
            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This version of the function handles the different types of indexers correctly and avoids the `KeyError` that was raised when using list indexers. The function now uses `ensure_index` to ensure that the correct indexer is used to access the values from the series.
