There are a few issues with the current implementation of the `_get_with` function. Based on the error messages, failing tests, and runtime values and types, it seems that the bug is related to how the function handles the `key` parameter and its type.

The `key` parameter is received and then passed through a series of checks, conversions, and conditional statements. However, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the different types of `key` inputs, which is leading to the failing tests.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the different types of `key` inputs and ensure that it processes them consistently and appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, pd.Series)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have made changes to the conditional statements and added additional checks to handle different input types of `key`. The function now checks for various data types, such as `pd.DataFrame`, `pd.Series`, and scalar values, and handles them appropriately in order to address the failing tests.

This corrected version should address the issues and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
