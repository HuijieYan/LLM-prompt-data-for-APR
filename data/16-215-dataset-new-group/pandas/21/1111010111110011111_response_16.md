The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case when the indexer is a list properly, leading to a KeyError in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that when the key is a list, the function doesn't handle it correctly, leading to a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with how array-like indexers are handled and also inconsistent with `ser.loc[key]`, which raises an error for all four cases in the failing test.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the function handles the case when the key is a list in the same way it handles other array-like indexers, and to make sure it behaves consistently with `ser.loc[key]`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        else:  # For other types of keys
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the case when the key is a list in the same way it handles other array-like indexers. It also ensures that the function behaves consistently with `ser.loc[key]` for all cases, resolving the issue.
