Looking at the provided error message and the buggy function, it appears that the bug is caused by the function's inability to handle different types of input keys such as lists, arrays, Index, and Series correctly. The error messages indicate that the function does not raise the expected KeyError in these test cases.

The bug seems to be due to the incorrect handling of key types and the absence of proper checks to handle the different types of keys. Specifically, the block of code that handles the type of key is where the issue occurs. It fails to correctly identify and handle the different types of keys, leading to an unexpected KeyError.

To fix this bug, we should add correct checks and handling for each key type: list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index. This would ensure that the function can correctly identify the type of the key and handle it appropriately.

Given the information above, let's proceed with the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is a list or array
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
            
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, the initial branches remain the same. However, we added a check for list, array, ExtensionArray, and Series keys. For the specified checks, we have also added handling to ensure the function correctly processes each different type of key. By incorporating these conditions and tailored handling, we aim to rectify the issue and pass the failing test cases.
