The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to the identification of the type of the `key` variable. This is causing the function to incorrectly determine how to handle the input, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

The function checks the type of the `key` parameter to determine how to proceed with the indexing. Based on the provided information, it appears that the code is incorrectly identifying the type of the `key` variable, leading to incorrect handling of the input data and subsequent failures.

To fix this bug, it is important to correctly identify the type of the `key` variable and then apply the appropriate logic to handle the indexing operation. This can be achieved by ensuring that the type checks and conversions are performed accurately within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function uses the `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions to accurately identify the type of the `key` variable and appropriately handle the indexing operation. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass.
