Fixed code with comments:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/series.py

# fixed function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    # Removed the check for non-list-like and scalar types here to avoid confusion and potential bugs
    # Removed the unnecessary conversion to a list here
    # Removed the key_type variable and the subsequent checks as it's not used anywhere else
    else:
        # If none of the above cases match, reindex key
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By simplifying the logic in the `_get_with` function and removing unnecessary checks and conversions, the fixed code is now more straightforward and less error-prone. This should address the potential issues and help the function pass the failing test cases.
