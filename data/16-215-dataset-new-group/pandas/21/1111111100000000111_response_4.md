The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, as described in the GitHub issue. The issue states that the behavior of using `ser[list(key)]` is inconsistent with using `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]`, which all result in NaN values for a key with no matches. Additionally, the behavior is inconsistent with `ser.loc[key]`, which raises an error for all 4 cases.

The bug in the function is caused by the different handling of indexers, specifically when a list is used as an indexer. This inconsistency in behavior is affecting the functionality of the function.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers needs to be aligned with the behavior of other array-like indexers, and it should be consistent with the behavior of the `loc` method. This fix will ensure that all types of indexers behave uniformly and return consistent results when encountering a key with no matches.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis of the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Align handling of list indexers with other array-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # Handle the case where key is an instance of Index
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Default to using self.loc for consistency
        return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected version of the function aligns the handling of list indexers with other array-like indexers and ensures consistent behavior with the `loc` method. This fix addresses the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue and ensures uniform behavior across different types of indexers.
