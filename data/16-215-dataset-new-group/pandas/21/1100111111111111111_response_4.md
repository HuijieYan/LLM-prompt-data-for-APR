The issue seems to be related to the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` operation. The test case `ser[list(key)]` is not behaving as expected and is resulting in a KeyError, while other array-like indexers are not. The expected behavior is for all these cases to behave consistently.

The bug in the `Series._get_with` method seems to stem from the handling of list indexers. When the key is a list, the function does not handle it correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

Based on the analysis of the bug and the failing tests, it seems that the bug can be fixed by modifying the code to handle list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__

    # Handle list indexers as array-like indexers
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version should handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across all types of indexers. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and the failing tests.
