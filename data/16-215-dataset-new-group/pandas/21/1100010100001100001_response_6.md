The bug occurs in the function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function is designed to handle different types of input keys and return the appropriate values for the given keys. However, it fails to do so in certain cases.

The identified potential error locations within the buggy function include the logic that identifies the type of the input key and selects the appropriate slice or value to return.

In each case, the function fails to correctly identify the type of the input key, resulting in an incorrect determination of the key_type variable.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly infers the type of the key, resulting in the wrong type being assigned to the key_type variable.

To fix the bug, the function should accurately determine the type of the key and based on that, select the appropriate method for extraction or reindexing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Determine the type of the key and select the appropriate method
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```
In this corrected version, the function now accurately determines the type of the key and selects the appropriate method for extraction or reindexing based on the key's type. This should resolve the bug and address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
