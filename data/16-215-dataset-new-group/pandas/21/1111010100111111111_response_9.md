The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the different behaviors when indexing with a list compared to other array-like objects. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency and provides an example of the undesired behavior.

The problem occurs in the `else` clause of the `_get_with` function when `key` is not an instance of `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`. The function incorrectly treats `key` as an index, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing with a list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like objects consistently, regardless of their specific type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Treat all list-like objects the same way:
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we handle all list-like objects by calling `self.reindex(key)`, ensuring consistent behavior for all array-like key types.

This modification addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and resolves the bug in the `_get_with` function.
