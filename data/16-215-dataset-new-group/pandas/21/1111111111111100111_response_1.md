To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case of a list-like key properly to avoid the KeyError. Based on the failing tests and the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs when a list-like key is used as an indexer for the Series.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like keys in a consistent manner, leading to a KeyError when a list key is provided. This inconsistency is observed in the failing test cases as well as in the GitHub issue.

The key_type inferred from the list-like key is incorrectly set to 'string' in all failing cases, which indicates a logical error in the key type inference.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the key type inference logic and also handle list-like keys properly to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Handle list-like keys properly
        if is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
            return self.loc[key]

        # Handle other types of keys
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
                #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]

            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like keys properly by converting them to a list and using `.loc` to return the corresponding values. This ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently without causing a KeyError.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
