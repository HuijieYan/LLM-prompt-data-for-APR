The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and others in the Series class. However, it seems to be improperly handling the keys and returning incorrect values. The bug is likely causing the function to raise a `KeyError` when it is expected to return a valid output.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle each type of key and ensure that the function returns the expected output for each case. We will update the code to handle the different key types correctly, ensuring that the indices are respected and that the function returns the correct values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This updated version simplifies the function by directly returning the results based on the type of the key. This should handle the cases correctly and resolve the `KeyError` that is currently being raised. After applying this fix, the tests should pass as expected.
