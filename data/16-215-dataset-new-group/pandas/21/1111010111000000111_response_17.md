## Analysis
The buggy function here is `_get_with` which is used for indexing the `Series` class. It is supposed to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, and individual elements. However, the function has different behavior for array-like indexers compared to list indexers, leading to inconsistency.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The condition to check if key is array-like using `is_list_like(key)` may be incorrect.
2. The handling of a list key is currently inconsistent with the handling of other array-like indexers.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency is causing the failing test case.

## Potential Fixing Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list key is consistent with other array-like indexers. Additionally, the condition to check for array-like indexers should be revised to remove the inconsistency.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the conditions to handle various types of indexers have been revised to ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers. The specific check for list-like objects has been removed, and instead, all array-like indexers are handled using a single code path by calling `_get_values` for such key types. This will ensure consistent handling of different indexers and resolve the bug.
