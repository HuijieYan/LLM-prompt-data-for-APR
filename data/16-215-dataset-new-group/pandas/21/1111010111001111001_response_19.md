The issue in the buggy function could be the comparison of the `key_type` variable with the string `"integer"` which is causing the incorrect behavior. It looks like `key_type` is being inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which indicates that the type of the `key` isn't being inferred correctly. 

A possible strategy to fix the bug is to use a different method to infer the type of the `key` variable. One way to do this is to use `np.asarray` to convert the `key` to an array and then check the dtype. This should give the correct type of the key for all input types.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    key = np.asarray(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now correctly infer the type of the `key` variable and perform the appropriate indexing based on that type. This should resolve the failing tests.
