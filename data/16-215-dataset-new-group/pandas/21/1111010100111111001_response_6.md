The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the function incorrectly handles different types of keys. It fails to properly determine the type of the key and may lead to the wrong branch being selected. This results in unexpected behavior and a failing test.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify the type of the key and handle each type appropriately. Specifically, the function should correctly handle cases where the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame) or isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):  # Updated condition to handle DataFrame
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Convert non-list-like keys to list
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]
            
        key_arr = np.asarray(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Infer the type of the key
        
        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:  # Updated condition to handle integer keys
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key_arr]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key_arr]
        elif is_bool(key):  # Added condition to handle boolean keys
            return self.loc[key_arr]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key_arr)
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the key is a slice, DataFrame, or tuple, and handles these cases accordingly. Then, it converts non-list-like keys to a list and infers the type of the key using the `infer_dtype` function. Based on the inferred key type, the function handles integer keys, boolean keys, and other types of keys appropriately.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.

Note: It's important to have access to the full library code to implement and test this fix effectively.
