The buggy function `_get_with` is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which is causing inconsistency in behavior. The specific error occurs when using a list indexer as key, which results in a KeyError. 

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to update the handling of list indexers to be consistent with array-like indexers. This could involve modifying the logic for handling list indexers to match the behavior of array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = np.array(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the logic for handling list indexers has been updated to match the behavior of array-like indexers, ensuring consistency in behavior. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
