The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case of a list-like key properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior. The code currently does not properly handle a list as a key, leading to unexpected errors and inconsistent behavior with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner, similar to how other indexers are handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (float, int)):
        return self._get_value(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we check if the key is a list-like object and handle it consistently with other types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and ensure that list-like keys are handled properly.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue, as it aims to address the inconsistency in behavior when using list-like keys for indexing a Series.
