The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class is related to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically a list indexer. The issue arises from inconsistent behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError when using a list indexer.

The key issue is that the function is not handling list indexers properly, leading to unexpected behavior and errors when attempting to access elements from the Series using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers, and that they do not raise a KeyError when used to access elements from the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This should resolve the KeyError issue when using a list indexer, and the function should now pass the failing test.
