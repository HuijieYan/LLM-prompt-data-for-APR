The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in the `ser` Series. The issue raised in GitHub indicates that different types of indexers are causing inconsistent behaviors, and it mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises for all cases.

The bug can be traced to the `if not is_list_like(key)` condition, which leads to different behaviors for list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The function encounters difficulties in handling list indexers, causing the inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indexing is handled consistently for all types of indexers. Resolving the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to the behavior for array-like indexers will likely resolve the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if all(map(is_bool, key)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the lines handling list and array-like indexers have been modified to ensure consistent treatment of both types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistent behavior and ensure that the test cases pass.
