The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the logic for determining the type of the key, which is used to decide the method to be called for indexing into the Series.

The buggy function is not handling the input key properly, causing it to incorrectly identify the type of the key, leading to the execution of the wrong indexing method.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for determining the key type and adjust the method calls accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary checks and uses the `lib.infer_dtype` method to determine the key type, and then proceeds to index into the Series using the appropriate method based on the key type.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle different types of keys and return the expected results for the given input values and types in the test cases.
