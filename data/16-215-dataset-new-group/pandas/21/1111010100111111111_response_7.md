## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
After analyzing the bug and understanding the inputs and expected outputs, the corrected code above simplifies the logic inside the `_get_with` function. It first checks if the `key` is list-like, and if so, it uses the `reindex` method to return the result. If it's not list-like, it falls back to using the `loc` method for indexing.

This corrected version satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted in GitHub.
