The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, especially when using a list as an indexer. This inconsistency is leading to the KeyError when trying to access an element using a list as an indexer.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle different types of indexers uniformly, especially when using a list as an indexer. It should also consider the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` and ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a call to `ensure_index` to ensure that the index is handled uniformly. We also removed the redundant type checking and handling, and directly performed the necessary operations based on the type of the index.

This corrected version should resolve the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the function behaves uniformly across different types of indexers. It should also pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
