The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely to be due to a problem in the handling of the `key` parameter. The function attempts to handle different types of `key`, such as a slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others. However, the handling may not be correct for all cases, leading to the failing test.

The bug could be fixed by refactoring the code to handle different types of `key` separately and ensure that for each type, the correct action is taken. There may be a mismatch between the inferred type of the `key` and the expected behavior in the subsequent code block.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've added a check for scalar values and used `loc` to access the element based on the key. For other cases, we simply reindex using the key.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
