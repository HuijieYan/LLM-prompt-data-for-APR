The buggy function `_get_with` has a logical error in the way it handles different types of indexers. It fails to properly handle the case where a list-like indexer is provided. 

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle different types of indexers, and the logic to handle the case of a list-like indexer is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case where a list-like indexer is provided and that it returns the expected result.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_array = np.asarray(key)
    if is_bool(key_array) or is_integer(key_array):
        return self._get_value(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is a slice, then handle the case of a DataFrame, and then proceed to handle scalar, boolean, and integer keys using appropriate checks. Finally, the `key` is converted to a NumPy array and the type is checked to handle all other cases. This approach ensures that all types of indexers are properly handled and the function returns the expected result.

By making these changes, we address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function handles different types of indexers consistently.
