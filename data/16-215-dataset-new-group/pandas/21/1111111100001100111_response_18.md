To fix the bug, we can update the `_get_with` function to handle the case where `key` is a list-like object.

The key issue here is that when `key` is a list-like object, the function does not handle it properly, leading to an inconsistent behavior with different types of indexers.

We can fix the bug by updating the handling of the `key` when it is a list-like object. We will modify the function to properly handle the case and ensure consistent behavior across different indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like objects
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other cases
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This version of the function handles the case where `key` is a list-like object by using `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the values for the provided keys. This ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

By making this modification, we can ensure that the function behaves consistently and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub report.
