The buggy function `_get_with` has several potential error locations:
1. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` does not account for the case where `key` is not an instance of any of these types, and it converts `key` to a list. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `key` is not iterable.
2. The variable `key_type` is assigned a value based on the type of `key`, but it is never used to determine the return value.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the type of `key` and determining the appropriate action based on its type. This can lead to inconsistencies in behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can add additional checks to correctly determine the type of `key` and use that information to return the expected values. We should also remove the unnecessary code that converts `key` to a list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary conversion of `key` to a list and added additional checks to handle scalar values. We also use the `key_type` to determine the appropriate action based on the type of `key`.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
