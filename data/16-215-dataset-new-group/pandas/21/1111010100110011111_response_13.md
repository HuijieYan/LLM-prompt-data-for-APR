## The location of the bug
The bug is located within the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.

## The cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. When using `ser[list(key)]`, a `KeyError` is raised, stating that "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other array-like indexers and causes unexpected failures in tests.

## The strategy for fixing the bug
The strategy for fixing the bug involves making the behavior of list indexers consistent with array-like indexers and resolving the issue raised on GitHub.

## The corrected version of the `_get_with` method
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["string", "integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` method makes the behavior of list indexers consistent with other array-like indexers, ensuring that they all behave in the same manner and do not raise unexpected `KeyError` exceptions. This correction also addresses the issue raised on GitHub regarding the inconsistency between different types of indexers.
