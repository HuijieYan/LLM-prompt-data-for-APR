## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` file. The problem stems from different behaviors when using list indexers and array-like indexers. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior and is related to the `KeyError` exception.

The failing test is trying to index a `Series` using different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). In some cases, the behavior is inconsistent, and the function is not raising the `KeyError` exception where it's expected to do so.

## Bug Location
The bug might be located in the conditional statement block where it checks if the `key` is not list-like. The bug causes the function to return incorrectly and not raise the `KeyError` exception in certain cases, leading to inconsistent behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different types of indexers and the inconsistency in raising a `KeyError` exception. The failure to raise an exception causes the test to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function consistently checks for and raises a `KeyError` exception when necessary for all types of indexers. This could involve modifying the logic within the conditional statements, especially the ones related to checking the `key_type` and deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the conditional statement checking for non-list-like keys to raise a `KeyError` exception when the key is not found in the index. This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
