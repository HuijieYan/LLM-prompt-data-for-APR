The buggy function `_get_with` contains an if-elif-else chain to handle different types of keys. The bug arises when a list-like key is provided. The function attempts to check if the key is not list-like, but this check fails to handle all cases, leading to the incorrect execution path with unexpected results.

The function is trying to determine the type of key based on various conditions, but it does not handle the "list" case correctly. This leads to incorrect inference of the key type, which causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the "list" case specifically and ensure that it is properly identified and processed. We also need to reconsider the logic for inferring key types to ensure accurate and consistent results.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the "list" case by checking if the key is list-like using the `is_list_like` function. If it is, we convert it to a list. Then, we proceed with type inference and processing according to the inferred type.

These changes aim to address the specific problem with list-like keys and ensure that the function accurately determines the type of key to provide correct results.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers.
