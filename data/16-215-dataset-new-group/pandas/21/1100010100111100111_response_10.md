To fix the bug, we need to modify the _get_with function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. The issue posted on GitHub also provides valuable context for understanding the expected behavior and the inconsistency in the current implementation.

The problem seems to be related to the handling of list indexers, which is causing inconsistencies and issues with KeyError. To address this, we should modify the logic for list indexers to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a new condition to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This should address the inconsistencies and resolve the KeyError issues identified in the failing tests.

By making this change, the corrected _get_with function should now align with the expected behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
