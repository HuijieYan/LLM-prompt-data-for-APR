The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when using a list-like key that does not match any values in the index of the Series. This causes an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers, such as array-like or Index objects.

The cause of the bug is that the function treats list indexers differently from other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. When using a list key, the function does not handle the case where none of the index values match the key, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that for all types of indexers (including list-like), we handle cases where none of the index values match the key. This ensures consistent behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

With this correction, the function should now handle list indexers in a similar manner to other types of indexers and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised when there are no matching values in the index.
