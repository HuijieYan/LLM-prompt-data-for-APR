The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError when attempting to access a Series with a list-like key. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series.

The problem lies in the conditional blocks for different types of key. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object, as it leads to a KeyError. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the conditional block for handling list-like keys needs to be adjusted to ensure it behaves consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle list-like key
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've added a new conditional block at the end to handle list-like keys, ensuring consistent behavior with other types of indexers.

This should resolve the KeyError issue when using a list-like key to access the Series, and it aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue.
