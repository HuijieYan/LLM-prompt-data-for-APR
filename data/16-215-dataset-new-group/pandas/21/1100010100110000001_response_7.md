The given buggy function `_get_with` has a number of issues resulting in the failing test cases. The error message indicates `KeyError`, meaning that the provided key is not found in the index.

The buggy function has issues with handling keys of type `list`, `Index`, and `Series`. It tries to process the keys based on their types, which is resulting in incorrect indexing.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to convert the `key` to a list and then utilize boolean indexing to get the correct result.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    # Convert the key to a list
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            mask = np.in1d(self.index, key)
            return self[mask]
        except:
            raise KeyError(f"Some elements in the provided key were not found in the index: {key}")
```
This corrected function covers the scenarios for different types of keys: slice, DataFrame, and others. It converts the keys to a list and then uses boolean indexing to retrieve the desired elements. This approach should fix the issues causing the failing tests.
