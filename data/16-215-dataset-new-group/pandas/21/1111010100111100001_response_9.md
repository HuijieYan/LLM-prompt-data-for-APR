The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of the key parameter. When the key is a list and the key_type is inferred to be 'integer', the function incorrectly uses the `self.loc[key]` to try and locate the specified index. This results in a KeyError being raised.

The bug can be fixed by checking the type of the key and handling it appropriately based on its type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version first checks if the key is an array-like or an Index, in which case it directly uses `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not an array-like or an Index, it proceeds to handle it based on its type as per the original function.
