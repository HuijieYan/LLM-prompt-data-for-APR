The bug stems from the `_get_with` method which exhibits an issue when the key is obtained from a Series. A `KeyError` is raised in the test cases when attempting to access `ser[key]`.

A key error is returned which means the key used to access `ser[key]` is not present in the index. The issue is due to the fact that the `key` is wrapped inside a Series, and the `_get_with` method does not handle it properly.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` method needs to be modified to handle the case where the key is a Series. We will extract the array representation of the key using the `to_numpy()` method and  pass it to the `reindex` method of the Series to return the data. This will ensure that the type of the key passed into `_get_with` is consistent and handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Extract the array representation of the key and reindex using it
    key_arr = key.to_numpy() if isinstance(key, Series) else key
    return self.reindex(key_arr)
```

With this correction, the function now checks if the `key` is a Series, extracts the array representation using `to_numpy()`, and then reindexes the series with the extracted key array. This will fix the bug and the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
