The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer. The test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file is failing due to this inconsistent behavior. This bug has been reported in GitHub issue #5880 with the title "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not handling the list indexer case correctly, leading to a KeyError when performing `ser[list(key)]`. This behavior is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are handled.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to handle the list indexer case in a way that is consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the list indexer case in a way that is consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers. With this fix, the `test_getitem_no_matches` test should pass, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
