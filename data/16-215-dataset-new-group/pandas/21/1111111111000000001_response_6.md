The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function in the `pandas.core.series` file. The function has multiple conditional checks for the type of `key` provided and how to handle each type. However, when the `key` is a box (list, array, Index, Series), the function incorrectly tries to reindex `key`, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the last conditional block in the `_get_with` function to handle lists, arrays, Index, and Series separately. This will prevent the bug from occurring and ensure that the correct behavior is applied.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle list key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle numpy array and pandas Index or Series key
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # handle scalar key
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise ValueError("Unsupported type of key")
```

This corrected version handles the `key` differently based on its type, ensuring that the appropriate behavior is applied for lists, arrays, Index, and Series.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test.
