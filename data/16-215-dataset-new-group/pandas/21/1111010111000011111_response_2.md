The buggy function `_get_with` has inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers, leading to failing test cases and an open GitHub issue. The issue arises when using a list indexer, which does not behave consistently with other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function handles different types of indexers in different ways, leading to inconsistent behavior and failing test cases. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches`, which expects the same behavior for list/ndarray/Index/Series indexers. However, the function does not handle list indexers the same way as other types, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. We can achieve this by modifying the logic in the function to ensure that all types of indexers are processed in a consistent manner, leading to uniform behavior across different indexer types.

Here's the corrected version of the function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    index_values = self.index.values
    key_values = key if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)) else key.values

    mask = np.isin(key_values, index_values)

    if not mask.any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

By using the `np.isin` function, we can check for matches between the given key and the index values. If none of the values in the key are found in the index, a KeyError is raised to maintain consistency across different types of indexers.

This corrected version should address the inconsistencies in the original function and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers, satisfying the failing test cases and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
