The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the handling of different types of indexers. When a list-like indexer is used, it is not being handled correctly and results in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled in the same way as other array-like indexers such as pd.Index and np.array.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like indexers in the same way as array-like indexers
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # For other cases, reindex the Series
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction ensures that list-like indexers are handled in the same way as array-like indexers by using `self.loc[key]`. This should resolve the KeyError issue seen in the failing tests.

Once this corrected version is implemented, it should be tested to ensure it passes the failing tests and resolves the GitHub issue about inconsistent behavior in handling list indexers.
