The bug in the code is related to handling different types of indexers, such as list, array-like, and Index. The issue arises when using a list indexer, which leads to a KeyError that is not consistent with the behavior of the other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is due to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled. The _get_with function is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access an element that does not exist in the index.

To fix the bug, the _get_with function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly handling list indexers before checking for other types, we ensure that the behavior is consistent and that the KeyError issue is resolved.

This fix should address the reported bug and pass the failing test cases. It will also align the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue report.
