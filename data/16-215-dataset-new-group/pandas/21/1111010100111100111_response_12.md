Based on the provided information, it looks like the bug is related to how different types of indexers are handled by the `_get_with` function. The failing tests show that using a list indexer (`list(key)`) results in a KeyError, while other indexers (such as `Index(key)`, `np.array(key)`, and `pd.Series(key)`) do not raise an error.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `key` variable when it is a list. It is evident from the failing tests that the handling of list indexers is different from other indexers, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle list indexers (`list(key)`) in a consistent manner with other indexers such as `Index(key)`, `np.array(key)`, and `pd.Series(key)`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Handle list-like key consistently with other indexers
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the `key` is a list-like object and then uses the `reindex` method to handle it, making the handling consistent with other indexers.

With this correction, the failing tests should pass and the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
