The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of the key parameter and its type. The function contains multiple conditions for different types of keys, but the key_type variable is not being used correctly, and the logic for handling key types seems to be flawed.

Additionally, the "key" parameter is expected to contain the index keys for the Series, but in Case 4, it seems to contain a Series object itself, which is unexpected and could be a potential cause of the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the different types of keys in the function, including handling Series input correctly.
2. Ensure that the key_type variable is used correctly to determine the type of the key parameter.

Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the function would be as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like, Series, or Index types
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now properly handles the different types of keys, including Series input, and utilizes the key_type variable to determine the type of the key parameter. It should pass the failing test cases.
