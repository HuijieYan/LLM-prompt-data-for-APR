The `_get_with` function is set up to handle different types of inputs for key but does not properly interpret inputs as expected, leading to errors. A failing test calls the function with a specific kind of key, and no exceptions are raised where the test expects there to be a KeyError, which indicates that the function is not handling the input correctly.

The bug in this case may be that the function is incorrectly handling a particular `box` type used as `key` in the failing test. The `box` parameter is set to multiple types in the failing tests, including list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. The bug may be due to the function not handling one of these types correctly, leading to the KeyErrors observed in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function is able to correctly handle each input type that is passed as `key`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
            
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
                # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
                
            elif isinstance(key, list):
                # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
                return self.loc[key]

            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
        
        else:
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function contains additional checks to handle different types of inputs for the `key` parameter, ensuring that each type is dealt with correctly within the function. This should resolve the issue with the failing test and ensure that the corrected function is able to handle key inputs as expected.
