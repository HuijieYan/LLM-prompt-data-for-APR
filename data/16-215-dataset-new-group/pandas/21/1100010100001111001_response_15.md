To understand the buggy function, let's start by understanding its flow and the purpose of each section. 

The function `_get_with` takes a `key` as input and performs different operations based on the type of `key`. It handles slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, and lists. 

However, there is an inconsistency in how the `is_list_like` check is conducted. In one part of the function, there's a check for `is_list_like`, but in another part, `key` is explicitly converted to a list without such a check. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect handling of the input `key`. Also, there's an issue with the `key_type` check which is intended to determine how to treat the `key` (e.g., whether to use `iloc` or `loc`). The function uses the variable `key_type` to determine the type of the key, but the type check and conversion logic inside the function is inconsistent and incomplete.

This inconsistency is leading to the incorrect determination of the `key_type` when the input `key` has list-like properties.

To fix this, the function needs to have consistent type checks and handle lists and list-like objects properly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle all possible data types of `key` and ensure that we consistently determine the `key_type`. We use `isinstance` checks along with a comprehensive check for list-like objects using `is_list_like`. This ensures that the function handles the input `key` correctly, regardless of its data type.
