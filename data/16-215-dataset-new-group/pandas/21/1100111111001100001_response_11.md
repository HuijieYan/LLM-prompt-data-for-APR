The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect detection of the type of the `key`. As a result, the function incorrectly determines the `key_type`, leading to an incorrect path being taken in the conditional statements.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the type of the `key` and then handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, ABCSeries, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we simplify the conditions and directly handle the different types of `key`. We use the `loc` method for indexing when the `key` is a slice, DataFrame, list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. Otherwise, we fall back to reindexing the key.

By using this simplified approach, we avoid the incorrect determination of the `key_type` and ensure that the correct indexing method is used for the given `key` type. This fix should address the issue and make the function pass the failing tests.
