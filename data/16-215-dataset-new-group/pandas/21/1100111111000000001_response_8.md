The problem with the `_get_with` function is that it's not handling the case of an empty list correctly when using `ser[key]`. The error occurs when the program is checking if the key is a list-like and not recognizing empty lists as index items. This leads to a KeyError when trying to access the elements of an empty list from the Series object.

To fix the bug, we need to change how the empty list case is handled to avoid the KeyError. We can use an if-else condition to specifically check if the key is an empty list, and if so, return an empty series. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if len(key) == 0:
        return Series([], index=self.index)  # return empty series with same index
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    # ... remaining code
```

This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle empty lists correctly.
