To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers with a Series.

The issue arises from the different behaviors observed when using different indexers with the `ser` Series and the key Series. When `ser[key]` is used, the result is `NaN`, while `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError. This is inconsistent behavior, and the bug is related to this difference.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # Handle list-like indexers consistently
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert to Index if not already
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index(key)` for list-like indexers, we ensure that `key` is treated consistently as an index, resolving the inconsistency in behavior. This change aligns the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers when used with the `ser` Series.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, thereby resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
