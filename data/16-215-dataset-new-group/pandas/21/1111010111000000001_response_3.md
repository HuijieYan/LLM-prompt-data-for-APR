The buggy function `_get_with` has multiple bugs that are causing it to fail. Here are the identified issues:
1. The function lacks proper handling for the case when `key` is an instance of `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`.
2. The function does not properly handle the case when `key` is not list-like, by using `loc` instead.
3. The function is not handling the case when `key` is of type `ABCDataFrame` as required by the buggy class.
4. The function fails to handle the case when `key` is a tuple, as it should invoke the `_get_values_tuple` function.

To fix these bugs, we need to:
1. Properly handle each `if` condition for different types of `key`.
2. Ensure that the correct methods are called based on the type of `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and not isinstance(key, (bool, str)):
        # handle the non-list like scalars
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_dict_like(key):
        # handle the case when `key` is a dict
        return self.reindex(list(key))
    else:
        raise TypeError("Key type not supported")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes and properly handling the different types of `key` that the function might encounter, we can ensure that the corrected function passes the provided failing test.
