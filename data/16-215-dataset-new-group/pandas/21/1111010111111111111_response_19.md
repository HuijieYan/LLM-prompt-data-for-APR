To fix the bug, we need to address the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The issue seems to be related to the validation of the indexer within the `_get_with` function of the `pandas.core.series.Series` class.

The problem arises when attempting to index a Series using a list indexer. This triggers a KeyError with a message that none of the provided index values are in the Series' index.

To address this issue, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same manner as other array-like indexers, such as numpy arrays or Pandas Index objects. We can update the logic inside the function to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Handle all array-like indexers in the same way
    indexer = ensure_index(key)
    if is_scalar(indexer):
        return self.loc[indexer]
    else:
        return self.reindex(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we use the `ensure_index` function to normalize the indexer, ensuring that both list and other array-like indexers are processed in the same manner. Then, we attempt to directly access the index values using `loc`. If the indexer is not a scalar value, we use `reindex` to handle the reindexing.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
