The issue here is that the `_get_with` function is not handling the list-like key properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the Series with a list key.

To fix this issue, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like keys in the same way as other indexers. This can be achieved by making a small adjustment to how list-like keys are handled in the function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Adjust the handling of list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the tests should pass, and the issue described in the GitHub post should be resolved.

Please note that this fix assumes that the classes and functions instantiated within the `_get_with` function behave as expected. If there are any unexpected behaviors in these related classes and functions, they should be addressed accordingly.
