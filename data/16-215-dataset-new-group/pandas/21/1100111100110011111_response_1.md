The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle the case when the key is a list-like object correctly. This leads to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior should be the same for all types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list-like indexers is consistent with the handling of other types of indexers.

By analyzing the code and the reported issue, we can see that the expected behavior for indexing with a list-like object is to raise a `KeyError` if the key does not match any elements in the index. Currently, the function is not handling this case properly for list-like indexers.

To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers. Specifically, when the type of the key is list-like, we should use the `loc` attribute to perform the indexing, and raise a `KeyError` if no matches are found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list-like indexers
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError as e:
        raise e
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner and raise a `KeyError` when no matches are found in the index.

By making this change, the function will pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
