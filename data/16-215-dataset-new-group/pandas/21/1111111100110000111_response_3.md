The issue appears to be related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when used with the `ser` Series. The error message indicates that when using `ser[key]` with a list indexer, it does not raise a KeyError as expected.

The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers and making the appropriate calls to other functions within the Series class.

The cause of the bug is that the validation of the list indexer in the `_get_with` function is not consistent with the behavior of other indexers, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, the validation for list-like indexers needs to be adjusted to match the behavior of array-like indexers. This may involve considering the handling of the index when dealing with list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected function, the validation and handling of list-like indexers have been adjusted to match the behavior of array-like indexers, ensuring that the KeyError will be raised as expected.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `_get_with` function handle list-like indexers consistently with array-like indexers.
