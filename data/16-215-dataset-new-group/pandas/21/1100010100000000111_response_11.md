The buggy function `_get_with` from the file pandas/core/series.py needs to be fixed to address the inconsistency in indexing when using different types of indexers. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different indexers, leading to unexpected errors and different output.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the conditional blocks that handle different types of indexers, especially the block that checks for list-like key.

The cause of the bug is due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to unexpected errors and inconsistencies in output, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks in the function need to be updated to handle different types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior is uniform and similar for all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like and array-like indexers consistently
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list-like and array-like indexers has been made consistent, ensuring that the behavior is uniform for all types of indexers. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub discussion.
