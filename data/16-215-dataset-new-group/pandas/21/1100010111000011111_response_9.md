The issue with the buggy function `_get_with` is that it does not handle the case where the key parameter is a list properly, leading to inconsistent behavior with different types of indexers. This inconsistency causes a KeyError to be raised where it shouldn't be, as described in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that when `key` is a list, the function does not handle it properly and falls back to reindexing, which causes the KeyError to be raised. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle the case where `key` is a list, and ensure that it returns the expected values and types for the given test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle the case when `key` is a list, ensuring that the expected values and types for the given test cases are met, and the issue raised in the GitHub issue is resolved.
