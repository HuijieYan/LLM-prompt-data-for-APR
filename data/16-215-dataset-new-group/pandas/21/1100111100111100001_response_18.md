The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely due to the incorrect handling of the input key. From the failing tests and input/output values, it is evident that the function is not able to handle the input key properly, resulting in different types of errors.

The cause of the bug is likely the mishandling of the key input, which leads to the wrong conditional branches being executed and incorrect types of key being used in the subsequent logic.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should properly handle the different types of input keys and determine the appropriate action based on the type of key provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version handles the different input types more appropriately and branches the logic based on the type of the key provided.

After applying this correction, the failing tests should pass.
