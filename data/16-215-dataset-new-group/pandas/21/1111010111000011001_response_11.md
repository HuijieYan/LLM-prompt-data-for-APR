Based on the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the bug occurs when the function tries to determine the type of the key. The function should correctly handle cases when the key is an integer, a list, a slice, or any other data type.

The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely caused by the incorrect determination of the key type, which affects the behavior of the function in handling different types of keys.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the key type is correctly inferred and handled in all cases. We can use conditional statements to handle each type of key separately and ensure that the function returns the appropriate result for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle different types of keys
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function now explicitly handles different types of keys using conditional statements, and the key type is correctly inferred in all cases before the function returns the appropriate result. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
