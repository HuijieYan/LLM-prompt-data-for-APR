The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The function fails to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter, leading to incorrect behavior and causing the tests to fail. 

The `key_type` variable should correctly represent the type of the `key` parameter, but in the buggy function, it is always assigned the value `'string'`. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior, which causes the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the `key` parameter is correctly identified and processed. We can use type-checking methods to determine the type of the `key` parameter and apply the appropriate indexing method based on the type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series method"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this correction, we have added type-checking conditionals to handle different types of the `key` parameter appropriately. This ensures that the indexing behavior is consistent and correct, which should resolve the failing tests.
