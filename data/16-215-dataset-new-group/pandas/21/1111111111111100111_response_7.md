The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistencies in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. It's leading to incorrect handling of indexers, resulting in KeyError exceptions. The function is not properly handling indexers like lists, leading to the raised exceptions and failing tests.

The bug is triggered when the input key is of type list, numpy array, Index, or Series, and the logic inside `_get_with` is incorrectly handling these cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the different types of indexers are handled consistently. We should modify the logic inside `_get_with` to properly handle list, numpy array, Index, or Series input types, and perform the necessary operations based on the type of indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers should be resolved, and the failing tests should pass.

The corrected version of the function ensures that list, numpy array, Index, or Series input types are handled consistently by using `self.loc[key]` for these cases. This should align the behavior with the expected results and resolve the inconsistencies reported in the GitHub issue.
