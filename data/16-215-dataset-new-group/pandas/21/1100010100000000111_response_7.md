The potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The statement `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` may not cover all types of valid indexers.

The cause of the bug using the buggy function and the GitHub Issue information:
- The bug arises from inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, particularly when using a list as an indexer, which can lead to a `KeyError` in certain cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the conditional statements to handle all types of valid indexers consistently, ensuring that all types of indexers return the expected result without errors.
- Ensure that when using a list as an indexer, the behavior aligns with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

Given the buggy function, here's a corrected version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "boolean":
        # Behavior for boolean indexer
        result = self.loc[key]
    elif key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            result = self.loc[key]
        else:
            result = self.iloc[key]
    else:
        result = self.reindex(key)
    
    return result
```
In the corrected version:
- I added a conditional statement to check if the key is an instance of `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`, and if so, converted it to a list.
- I handled boolean and integer type indexers separately by evaluating the `key_type` and behaving accordingly.
- The corrected version should resolve the issue posted in GitHub by providing consistent behavior for different types of indexers and ensuring that using a list as an indexer aligns with the expected behavior.
