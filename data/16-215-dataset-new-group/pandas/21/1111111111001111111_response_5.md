The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function fails to handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like indexers.

The bug causes a KeyError to be raised for list indexers, while other array-like indexers return a NaN value. This behavior is inconsistent and does not align with user expectations.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers, returning NaN values instead of raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are consistently handled with array-like indexers, returning NaN values if there are no matches in the index. This aligns with user expectations and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
