The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling list-like indexers correctly, resulting in inconsistent behavior and failures in the test cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers such as arrays or indices. This inconsistency is also mentioned in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, the `is_list_like` condition should be checked before other conditions to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other indexers. Additionally, the function should handle the list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):  # Check if the key is list-like
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle list-like indexers consistently with other indexers, resolving the issue and causing the failing tests to pass.
