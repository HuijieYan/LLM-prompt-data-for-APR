The buggy function `_get_with` has multiple potential error locations. One of the possible causes of the bug could be the incorrect identification of the `key_type`. The function uses `lib.infer_dtype` to infer the type of `key`, but there seems to be an issue with the way it's being inferred.

In the provided failing test, it can be seen that the key is of type 'object' and it is expected to raise a KeyError. However, the `key_type` is being inferred as 'string', which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred, and the appropriate type-specific operations are performed based on the type of `key`. Additionally, the conditional checks for different types of keys need to be accurate and handle the cases appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type is inferred after ensuring that the key is list-like. This should ensure that the correct type is being inferred, and subsequently, the appropriate operations are performed based on the type of the key.
