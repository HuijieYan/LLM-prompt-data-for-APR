The buggy function is `_get_with` and it is supposed to handle different types of indexers and return the desired result. However, it fails to properly handle certain types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The potential error locations in the function could be the handling of different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrame, tuple, scalars, Index, list, and other array-like indexers. Additionally, the method `reindex` may also lead to inconsistent behavior that needs fixing.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` fails to handle different types of indexers consistently, leading to unexpected results and inconsistencies. Specifically, the function fails to properly handle the case of a list indexer, causing a KeyError to be raised which is inconsistent with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers consistently and returns the expected results for each case.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles different types of indexers consistently and should pass the failing test case as well as satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
