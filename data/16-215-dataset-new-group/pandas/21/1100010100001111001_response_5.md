The issue with the function `_get_with` is that the key type is not being inferred correctly in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior. 

The buggy function has a check for `key_type == "integer"`, but since in the failing tests, `key_type` has the value of `'string'`, the else block should be executed, leading to the call to `self.reindex(key)`.

To fix this issue, we can remove the redundant checks for type `list` and `Index`, and set the `key_type` using the `infer_dtype` method before checking for integer keys, and execute the appropriate `loc` or `iloc` method based on the inferred type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/series.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Infer the type of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Use the inferred key type to decide whether to treat this as a positional or label-based indexer
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the failing tests.
