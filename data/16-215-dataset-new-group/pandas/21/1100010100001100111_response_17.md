The issue seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers in the pandas Series. The bug occurs when using a list indexer, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers (array-like or Index). The bug is causing a KeyError when using a list indexer, which is not consistent with the behavior of other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the input when it is a list indexer, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing the KeyError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function now properly handles list indexers and should provide consistent behavior with other types of indexers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
