To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency when indexing with a list. The failing test indicates that when indexing with a list, the function raises a `KeyError`, while indexing with other array-like data types does not. 

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles the different types of indexers. The failing test is designed to demonstrate an inconsistency in behavior when indexing with list, ndarray, Index, and Series data types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. We can modify the `_get_with` function to handle the list-like indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've added a check to ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers. If the indexer is not list-like, it uses the `loc` indexer. If the indexer is list-like, it first checks if all the elements are present in the index. If not, it raises a `KeyError`. This ensures a consistent behavior when indexing with different array-like data types.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
