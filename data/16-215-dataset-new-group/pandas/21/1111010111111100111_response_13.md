## Analysis
The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, it has a bug that causes it to behave differently when provided with a list as the key, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug
The bug appears to be in the `is_list_like` check, where the function checks if the key is a list-like object and then handles it differently from other types of indexers. This inconsistency causes the function to fail when given a list as the key, resulting in a KeyError.

### Cause
The cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list is passed as the key, it is not correctly handled and results in a KeyError, unlike other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have removed the `is_list_like` check and handled list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This should fix the bug and make the function behave consistently for all types of indexers.
