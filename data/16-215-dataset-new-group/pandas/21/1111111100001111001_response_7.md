Based on the provided source code and the runtime and expected values, we can see that the buggy function is failing to correctly identify the data type of the `key`. This can be seen as the `key_type` is always being assigned the value `'string'` instead of differentiating between the data types of the `key`.

The bug in the function lies in the logic that determines the `key_type`. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying the data type of the `key`, leading to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we need to add proper logic to identify the data type of the `key` and assign the correct `key_type` based on the data type of the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = 'array_like'
    else:
        key_type = 'scalar'

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional checks to identify the data type of the `key` and assign the correct `key_type` based on the data type. This should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles different data types for the `key`.
