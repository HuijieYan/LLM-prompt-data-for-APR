The issue with the `_get_with` function seems to be that it treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies and raising errors for some cases. This is evident from the failing test case provided, which raises a `KeyError` when trying to access the Series using a list key.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not handling list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and raising errors for list indexers. The error occurs due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the function.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that the logic for processing list indexers aligns with the logic for processing other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistencies and preventing errors.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the function ensures that all types of indexers, including list indexers, are handled in a consistent manner, preventing the inconsistencies and errors observed in the failing test case.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers as expected and pass the failing test case, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
