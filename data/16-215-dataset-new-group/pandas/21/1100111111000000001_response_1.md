The buggy function seems to be interpreting the input incorrectly and is not correctly handling the KeyError in the test function. The error is likely in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, specifically in the line `return self.reindex(key)`.

The bug seems to be due to the incorrect handling of keys that do not exist in the index, leading to a KeyError that is not being properly caught and raised. To fix the bug, the implementation of the `_get_with` function needs to be adjusted to handle keys that do not exist in the index properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_scalar(key) and not self.index.isin([key]).any():
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

The above corrected version of the `_get_with` function now includes a specific check for keys that are not found in the index, and raises a KeyError in those cases. This should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles keys that do not exist in the index.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and handle non-existent keys properly.
