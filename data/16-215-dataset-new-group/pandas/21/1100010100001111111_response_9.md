The buggy function is failing to handle some cases of indexing with a list. It is not correctly differentiating between different types of indexers. It also fails to handle the case of using a pandas `Index` object as a key.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and not handling the different types of indexers consistently.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately determine the type of the key and then handle each type of indexer appropriately. Additionally, it needs to treat the pandas `Index` object as a special case.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This fixed version of the function correctly handles different types of indexers and treats the `Index` object as a special case by using `ensure_index()` function to ensure consistent behavior. This should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and handle the expected input/output values.
