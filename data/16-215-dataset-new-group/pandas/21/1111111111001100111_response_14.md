The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. This is leading to a KeyError in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) consistently. The code does not differentiate between these types properly and does not handle the cases correctly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) consistently and ensure that the behavior is the same for all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['boolean', 'integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle scalar keys using `is_scalar(key)` and ensure that the key is treated consistently for different types using `ensure_index(key)` to ensure the appropriate behavior for each type of indexer.

This should resolve the inconsistency and the KeyError reported in the GitHub issue.
