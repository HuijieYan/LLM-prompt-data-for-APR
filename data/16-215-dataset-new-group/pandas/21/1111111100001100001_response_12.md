The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the incorrect determination of the `key_type`. The function wrongly identifies the type of the key, leading to the wrong behavior within the function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for determining the `key_type` and handle different types of keys appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version includes logic to handle different types of keys appropriately. We check if the `key` is a scalar or a collection, and directly use `loc` to index the Series. Otherwise, we default to using `reindex` to handle other key types. This approach should correctly handle different types of keys and fix the bug.
