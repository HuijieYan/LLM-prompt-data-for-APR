The error message indicates that the KeyErrors are not being raised as expected by the test, and it occurs when an invalid key is used to index a Series. The error messages suggest that the bug relates to handling the situation where the key passed to the Series is not present in the index.

The key could be the root cause of the problem. The function tries to check whether the key is a list or an ndarray, and for those types, it uses the `loc` attribute to index into the Series, which might be problematic.

To fix the issue, the code can be updated to handle cases where an invalid key is used to index the Series using a more robust strategy that considers different types of keys.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        if is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for scalar keys that are not present in the index, and raises a KeyError with a helpful message. This will provide more context for users when they index a Series with an invalid key.
