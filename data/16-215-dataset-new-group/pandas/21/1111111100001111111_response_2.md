A potential cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the key input properly, resulting in unexpected behavior and incorrect output. Specifically, the function is not properly checking for a list-like key and is not handling the case of a list key with no matches. This could be due to the different handling of array-like and list indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the case of a list key with no matches, similar to how array-like indexers are handled. Additionally, we need to handle the case of a list key without matches consistently with the other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # handle the case of a list key with no matches
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case of a list-like key by trying to access the key using `loc` and falling back to reindexing if a `KeyError` is raised. This ensures consistent behavior with the handling of other types of indexers.

By making these modifications, the function should now handle list-like keys with no matches more consistently and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
