The buggy function is `_get_with`. The function is trying to handle different types of inputs for key, such as ints, tuples, lists, ndarrays, and so on. However, when the input type of `key` is a pandas Series, it returns an error. This is seen in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`. It aims to use a Series as a key to index another Series, leading to an error: `KeyError`. This error indicates that the provided key did not match any index values in the Series being indexed.

The error occurs because when the key type is checked, and if it is a pandas Series, the function does not have an appropriate handling mechanism. This causes the key to break when the pandas Series is being used, and results in the KeyError.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to handle the case in which the key is a Series, and also checks if it is a dtype 'object'. This will ensure that all types of keys are handled properly within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handling of pandas Series key
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        if key.dtype == 'object':
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Indexing with a non-object Series is not supported")

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

With this corrected version, the function now has a conditional `isinstance` statement to handle pandas Series as keys, and it checks for the datatype 'object' within the Series. This will allow the function to handle Series as keys properly, and should pass the failing test.
