Based on the failing test and the runtime values, it appears that the issue stems from the key being a string, not an index value. The function does not handle this case properly, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditions for handling scalar key types and ensure that the correct indexing method is used based on the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition for handling scalar key types and utilizing the `loc` function for indexing, regardless of the key type. This should resolve the KeyError issue and ensure that the function works as expected.
