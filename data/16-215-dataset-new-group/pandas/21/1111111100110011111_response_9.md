## The potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Incorrect handling of the `is_list_like()` conditional statement may cause the function to return an incorrect value based on the key type.
2. The conditional statement for `is_list_like()` may have a logical error that needs to be reviewed.
3. The conditional statement for `isinstance(key, Index)` can affect the handling of the key type and may not behave as expected.

## Cause of the bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers, particularly in the handling of list indexers. This inconsistency leads to the incorrect behavior when using a list indexer, resulting in a `KeyError`.

In the failing test, the input key is being passed as a list, and the function fails to handle it properly, leading to the `KeyError` and the test failing.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The buggy function needs to be modified to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. Handling of list indexers should be reviewed, and the conditional statements for different types of indexers should be carefully evaluated to ensure correct behavior.

The fix would involve revising the conditional statements and the handling of each key type to ensure that the function produces the expected output for all input cases, including list indexers.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalar values and non-list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray)):
        # Ensure all index types are handled consistently
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # For list-like indexers, handle as a list
        return self.loc[key]
```

This revised version of the function handles different types of indexers consistently by using `loc` or `reindex` based on the type of the key. This should resolve the inconsistencies in the original function and ensure correct behavior for all input cases.
