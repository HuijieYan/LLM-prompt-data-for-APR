The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how different types of indexers are handled, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors for certain cases. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency and suggests that all cases should behave like the list case.

The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list or array-like indexer that does not match any values in the index, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors. This inconsistency is also present in other cases, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to standardize the behavior for all types of indexers, making them behave consistently and handle cases where there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Standardize behavior for all types of indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.nan)  # Handle cases where there are no matches in the index
```

In this corrected version, the behavior for all types of indexers is standardized. Additionally, for cases where there are no matches in the index, the `reindex` method is used, with `fill_value` set to `np.nan` to handle this scenario consistently for all types of indexers. This should address the inconsistencies and errors raised for certain cases, resolving the bug.
