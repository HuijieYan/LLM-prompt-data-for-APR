The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to the way it handles the key type and inferring its type. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key and therefore not returning the expected results.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to correctly identify the type of the key and return the appropriate values based on its type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Possibly Convert to index
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or ndarray is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_boolean_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated function includes a check for boolean type keys and also properly uses the `ensure_index` function to ensure that the key is converted to the appropriate index type for reindexing.

With these updates, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of keys and return the expected results.

Please note that the above changes are based on the assumption that the updated function should handle various types of input keys and the expected behavior is to properly index the Series based on the key type. If there are specific requirements or constraints for the behavior of the function, those should be considered when making the updates.
