To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. 

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers when accessing a Series, leading to inconsistent behavior. This is highlighted by the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches`, which expects consistent behavior across all types of indexers, but the behavior differs when a list indexer is used.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers (list, array-like, Index, Series) in a consistent manner. This should involve updating the conditional statements in the function to ensure consistent treatment of different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all indexer types consistently
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle all types of indexers consistently by converting the key to an Index using `ensure_index(key)`. This ensures that regardless of the type of key (list, array-like, Index, Series), it is treated in a uniform manner when accessing the Series.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should handle all types of indexers consistently and pass the failing test case, thereby resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
