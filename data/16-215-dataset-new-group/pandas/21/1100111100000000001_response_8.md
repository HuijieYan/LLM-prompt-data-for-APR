The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to the handling of different types of input keys. The function is intended to return values based on the key provided, such as a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or other data structure.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the conditional blocks that handle different types of keys, and in the check for the type of the key (e.g., list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index).

The cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect handling of input keys and the corresponding logic to determine the type of the key and how to retrieve values based on its type.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully analyzing the logic for handling different key types and making adjustments to ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the conditional blocks have been adjusted to handle different key types appropriately, and the checks for the type of the key have been modified to ensure that the correct operations are performed for each type. Additionally, the conditional blocks are more readable and follow a consistent pattern for handling different input key types.
