### Analysis
The bug seems to be related to how different indexers, such as list, array-like, and Index, are treated differently in the `ser` function. This inconsistency is causing a test to fail and raise a KeyError.

### Potential Error Locations
Based on the error message and the code, potential error locations could be around the indexing conditions using different types of indexers and the handling of `key` within the `_get_with` function.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent behavior of indexers when used with the `ser` function. The GitHub issue also points out this inconsistency and mentions that the test was added in the past, which broke due to this inconsistency.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all the different indexers, including list, array-like, and Index, are treated consistently within the `_get_with` function. This will involve modifying the conditional statements that handle the different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            if is_scalar(key):
                return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if isinstance(key, (pd.Series, list, np.ndarray)):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version:
- Added a check for scalar `key` within the `elif not is_list_like(key)` block.
- Removed the unnecessary conversion of `key` to a list within `if isinstance(key, Index)` block.
- Used a common `self.loc[key]` statement for indexing when `key` is of type pd.Series, list, or np.ndarray.
- Handled other cases by reindexing the `key`.

This corrected version should address the inconsistency and ensure that all kinds of indexers work consistently within the `_get_with` function.
