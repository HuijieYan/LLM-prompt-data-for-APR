In the provided buggy function `_get_with(self, key)`, the issue is likely with the handling of different types of indexers. The code does not handle the `else:` case at all for the top-level `if` statement, and it may not be properly identifying the type of key being passed in.

Potential errors in the `if-elif-else` structure and the handling of key types could have led to inconsistent behavior when dealing with different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with(self, key)` is not handling the types of indexers consistently, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential KeyError being raised for certain types of indexers.

One strategy for fixing the bug could be to implement consistent handling for different types of indexers by identifying the type of key being passed in and then appropriately processing it.

To fix the bug, here's a corrected version of the `_get_with(self, key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the redundant type check and added proper handling for different types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing KeyError for certain types of indexers. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test provided.
