The issue here is that the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, leading to inconsistent behavior and errors. The function needs to be updated to handle list-like keys consistently.

The bug is likely caused by the conditional checks for list-like keys being incorrect or insufficient to handle all cases properly.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for list-like keys should be revised to handle all possible list-like key types consistently, ensuring that they are properly converted to positional indexers if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer type")
```

By revising the conditional checks and adding handling for scalar keys, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle list-like key types consistently and handle all cases as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers.
