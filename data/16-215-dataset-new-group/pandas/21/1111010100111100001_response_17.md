The issue in the function is that it does not handle the case when the key is not found in the index properly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised when it should not.

To fix the bug, I will add a check to see if the key exists in the index before attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        msg = f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}"
        raise KeyError(msg)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the key exists in the index, and if it does, it will return the corresponding value. If the key does not exist in the index, it will raise a `KeyError` with an appropriate message.

This correction should address the issue of the failing tests.
