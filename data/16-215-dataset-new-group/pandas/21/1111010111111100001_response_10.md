It looks like the bug is due to the incorrect identification of the key type. The key type is being inferred as a string in all cases, which is not correct. This is causing the code to return `self.loc[key]` in all cases, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly identify the key type. We can do this by checking if the key is an instance of a list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, and handle each type accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we use `isinstance` checks to identify the type of the key, and then handle each type accordingly. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
