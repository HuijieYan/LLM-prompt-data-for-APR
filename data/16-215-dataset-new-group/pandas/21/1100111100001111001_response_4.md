The buggy function seems to have a bug related to the determination of the `key_type` variable, as it always takes the value `'string'`. This suggests that the logic of determining the `key_type` is not working as expected.

The function aims to get values based on the type of the key provided, whether it is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or other types. Then it determines the `key_type` and selects a path of action based on it. However, the logic for determining the `key_type` seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` needs to be revisited, specifically the condition checks and type inference. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle when key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic for determining the `key_type` has been updated, ensuring that it correctly infers the type based on the input `key`. This updated implementation should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected for the provided test cases.
