The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it does not handle the case where the key used for indexing is not found in the Series index. This results in a KeyError during the test execution.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the key is not found in the Series index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the function now correctly handles the case where the key is not found in the Series index. This should resolve the KeyError and make the failing test pass.
