The bug in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers, specifically when the key does not match any values in the index. This issue is consistent with the GitHub post titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches".

The bug occurs when the key does not match any values in the index, causing different behavior depending on the type of indexer used. The issue mentioned that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases.

To fix this bug, all different types of indexers should have consistent behavior when the key does not match any values in the index. The fix should ensure that the behavior is consistent regardless of the type of indexer used.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    result = self.loc[key]  # Use loc for all types of indexers
    if is_list_like(result):
        return self.reindex(key) 
    else:
        return result
```

This corrected version addresses the inconsistency and sets the behavior to consistently use `loc` for all cases, and then reindex the result when necessary. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer used.
