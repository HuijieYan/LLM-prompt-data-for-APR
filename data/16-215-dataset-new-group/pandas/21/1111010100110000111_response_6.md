## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is causing the test to fail, with different types of indexers behaving differently. When trying to access an index with a list, it raises a `KeyError` even though it should behave similarly to the other types of indexers (`pd.Index`, `np.array`, and `pd.Series`). This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue, where the behavior for different types of indexers is questioned. 

The buggy function seems to use incorrect checks for different types of indexers, leading to the inconsistent behavior and the `KeyError` being raised for the list indexer.

## Bug cause
The root cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle the list-like index properly. The checks for different types of indexers are not consistent and do not result in the expected behavior. This is what's causing the `KeyError` to be raised when using a list-like indexer.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the function `_get_with` needs to be fixed by properly handling list-like indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of other types of indexers. This may involve correcting the checks for different types of indexers and ensuring that the behavior is consistent for all types.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert to list

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Updated check for "integer" type
        if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
            # Make sure to handle the case where the key is a single item by returning self.iloc
            if is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
                return self.iloc[key[0]]
            elif is_list_like(key):
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]  # Handle other types of indexers
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function `_get_with` checks for list-like indexers and properly handles them by converting them to a list and then applying the appropriate operation based on the type of indexer. This should ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers and resolve the `KeyError` issue.
