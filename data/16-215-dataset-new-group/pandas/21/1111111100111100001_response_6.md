The bug in the _get_with function seems to be related to how it handles the 'key' parameter. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys (e.g., slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects) and perform the corresponding operations. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed in the function:

1. The function is not properly handling the case where the key is a list or an ndarray.
2. The key_type variable is being assigned a value based on the inferred type of the key, but it is not being used in any subsequent logic.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _get_with function to properly handle the different types of keys and use the key_type variable to make decisions about how to index the Series.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # handle slice indexing
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        # handle tuple indexing
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # handle scalars
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        # handle Index or ndarray keys
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # handle integer keys
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        # handle other types of keys
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we properly handle the different types of keys and use the key_type variable to determine whether to use label-based indexing (self.loc) or positional indexing (self.iloc). This should resolve the issue with the failing tests.
