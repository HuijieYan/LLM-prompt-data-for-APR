The bug in the function lies in the case when the `key` variable is not list-like, it's attempting to index the Series with the `loc` method instead of raising a KeyError. This causes the failing test cases as the return value is not as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to change the `self.loc[key]` line to raise a KeyError when the key is not list-like.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected function is designed to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
