The problem with the buggy function is that it is not handling the input key properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access the Series with the key.

The key issue here is with the incorrect handling of the key parameter in the `_get_with` function. It does not cover all possible types of keys that can be passed, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the key parameter, particularly when it is of type list, numpy array, pandas Index, or Series.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix changes the handling of the key parameter to correctly support list, numpy array, pandas Index, and Series types, allowing the function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
