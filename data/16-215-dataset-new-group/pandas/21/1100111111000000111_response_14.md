The problem with the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, specifically when there are no matches in the index. The function should handle list and non-list indexers consistently.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the inconsistent behavior of the function when dealing with list indexers and other array-like indexers. This causes the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` to fail with a KeyError for list indexers, while the behavior with other array-like indexers is different.

To fix the bug, we need to unify the behavior for list indexers and other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.empty:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this correction, we've added a check to ensure that if the key is a list-like object, we convert it to an index using the `ensure_index` function. We handle the case where the key is empty and raise a KeyError if none of the keys are in the index. Additionally, we check for boolean and integer indexers to select the appropriate indexing method using `loc` or `iloc`.

This corrected function unifies the behavior for list indexers and other array-like indexers, resolving the issue and making the function consistent with different types of indexers.
