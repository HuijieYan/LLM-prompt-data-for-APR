Based on the error messages and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. 

The error message indicates that there is an issue when using a list indexer, where a KeyError is raised suggesting that none of the items in the list are found in the index. This behavior seems inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

The mentioned GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. It also mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all 4 cases, indicating that the behavior is not consistent with different types of indexers.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. It should also ensure that the behavior aligns with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle the case for list indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handle other types of indexers as before
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to ensure that list indexers are handled properly, and the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers.

By making this change, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers in a manner consistent with other types of indexers, and the failing test should pass as expected.
