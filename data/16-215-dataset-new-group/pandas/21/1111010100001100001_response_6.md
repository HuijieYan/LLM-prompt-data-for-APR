Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, we can see that it tries to handle different types of keys to retrieve values from the Series. The function checks for slice, DataFrame, tuple, and other types before eventually reindexing the key.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the misclassification of the key type, which results in incorrect handling of the key. The variable `key_type` is determined using `lib.infer_dtype` and other checks, but it consistently returns `'string'` regardless of the input type. This indicates a problem with the type inference logic.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type inference for the key variable is correctly handled. This can be achieved by directly checking the type of the key using appropriate methods rather than relying on inference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = "index"
    else:
        key_type = "other"

    if is_integer(key) or (is_object_dtype(key) and not is_list_like(key) and not is_dict_like(key)):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we directly check the type of the key and handle it accordingly. We also modified the logic to use appropriate checks for integers and objects in the key. This should address the issues with type inference and improve the function's behavior.
