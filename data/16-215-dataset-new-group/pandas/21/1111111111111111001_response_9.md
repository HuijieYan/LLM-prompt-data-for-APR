The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The function does not correctly handle the case where the `key` is a list, numpy array, or an Index object. Instead, it treats the `key` as a scalar and tries to access the `self.loc` using the `key` as an index, which leads to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to add a proper check for Index and list-like objects and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated implementation, the function will appropriately handle different types of `key` inputs, including lists, numpy arrays, and Index objects, and return the correct result without raising a KeyError.

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases provided.
