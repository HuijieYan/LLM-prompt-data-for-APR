Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable. It is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` for all cases, which is causing the wrong execution path to be taken.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately infer the type of the `key` input and use it to correctly determine the appropriate execution path.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Infer the type of the key

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By accurately inferring the type of the `key` and using it to determine the correct execution path, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases.
