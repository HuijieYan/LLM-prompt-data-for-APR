The bug is found in the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, which fails the test `test_getitem_no_matches`. The failing test is caused by an indexing error: `ser[key]` should raise a `KeyError`, but it does not, indicating that the key is not properly handled by `_get_with`.

The `_get_with` function has multiple potential error locations:
1. `isinstance(key, tuple)`: This checks if the key is a tuple and calls an internal function `_get_values_tuple` if it is. This can potentially cause issues if the conditions for handling a tuple are not correctly defined.
2. The condition `if not is_list_like(key)` handles scalar values, but may not be correctly identifying the scalar data types.
3. The conditions for defining the `key_type` based on the data type of the key are highly complex and may be resulting in misclassification of the key type.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug involves carefully reviewing the conditions and checks for the key type and handling in the `_get_with` function and making necessary adjustments to ensure that different key types are correctly identified and processed based on the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    is_tuple = key and isinstance(key, tuple)
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif is_tuple:
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    key = list(key) if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key
    
    key_type = "integer" if is_integer(key) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key] if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() else self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition `is_tuple` to properly handle tuple-based keys. Additionally, we have restructured the key type checks and processing logic to ensure that scalars, lists, and other data types are correctly handled based on their type and expected behavior.
