The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in a `KeyError` when using a list indexer, while array-like indexers do not raise an error for the same input.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of indexers within the `_get_with` function, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version simplifies the handling of `key`, ensuring that it is converted to a list if it is list-like. The use of `is_list_like` and explicit type conversion should ensure consistent behavior for different indexer types.
