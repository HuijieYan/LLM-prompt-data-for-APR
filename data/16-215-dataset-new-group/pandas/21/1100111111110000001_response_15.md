The bug in the `_get_with` method is caused due to the incorrect handling of different types of keys. It is important to distinguish between the various types of keys and handle each type accordingly.

The key types that are failing are lists, ndarrays, and Series. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised, but the actual result is a failure because there is no catch for the type of key being passed into the function.

To fix this bug, we should first distinguish the types of keys being passed in and handle each type separately. Then, return the appropriate result based on the type of key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first handle the slice case, dataframe case, and tuple case, and then separate out string and integer types to handle them properly using `loc` and `iloc`. Lastly, we return `reindex` for other types of keys.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` method should pass the failing test cases.
