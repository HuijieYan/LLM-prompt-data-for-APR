The cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is not handling the case where the `key` is a list correctly, which results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of `key` inputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the list case in the same way as other types of `key` inputs. Specifically, when `key` is a list, it should return the result of `self.loc[key]`, and not result in a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle the case where `key` is a list, resulting in consistent behavior across different types of `key` inputs, and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
