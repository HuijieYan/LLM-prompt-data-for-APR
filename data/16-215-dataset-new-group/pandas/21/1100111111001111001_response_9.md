In the provided buggy function, the issue seems to be with the logic for determining the key_type and handling the key. It tries to infer the key_type and perform different operations based on the type of the key. However, in some cases, it is not handling the key correctly, resulting in a KeyError during the test. 

To fix the bug, the key type handling should be revised. The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of different key types or converting the key type to the positional indexer or label-based indexer.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to explicitly check and handle different key types in the function. Additionally, ensure that the type of the key is correctly identified and handled for the specific operation that needs to be performed.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        # handle other cases
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, I have made the necessary changes to handle different key types explicitly, ensuring that each type is correctly identified and handled to perform the required operation. This should resolve the KeyError issue during the failing tests.
