The cause of the bug is that the function is treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistency. When indexing with a list, it raises a KeyError, while indexing with other array-like types returns NaN, which is inconsistent behavior. This behavior is not aligned with the expectations of the tests and the GitHub issue that points out the inconsistency.

To fix the bug, we will modify the function to treat all array-like indexers, including lists, in the same way. The function should return NaN when none of the indexers are found in the index, consistent with the behavior when using other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = list(key) if not is_list_like(key) else key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.nan)
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
