The buggy function `_get_with` seems to be causing problems when indexing a Series with a list key. The issue appears to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the multiple `elif` conditions and the type checks for the `key` parameter.

The bug causes the function to not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and incorrect results when trying to index a Series with a list key. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing tests, which expect a `KeyError` to be raised, but no error is raised, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, ensuring consistency in behavior.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `key` parameter is converted to an Index using `ensure_index` to handle both list and array-like indexers consistently. The type checks have been adjusted to ensure uniform behavior for different types of indexers.

This corrected version of the function is expected to handle list indexers correctly, resolve the inconsistency in behavior, and pass the failing tests.
