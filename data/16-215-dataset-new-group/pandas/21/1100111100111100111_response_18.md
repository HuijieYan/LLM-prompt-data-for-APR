The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case when a list indexer is passed to the `ser[key]` operation correctly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised instead of returning `NaN` as expected. This inconsistency creates confusion and does not align with the behavior of other types of indexers.

The bug is likely caused by a mishandling of list indexers in the `if not is_list_like(key)` block, where it tries to use `self.loc[key]` instead of indexing the Series directly.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers needs to be adjusted to match the behavior of other indexers. This can be achieved by checking if the key is a list and directly indexing the Series using the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle list indexers correctly, returning `NaN` for keys that are not found in the index, consistent with the behavior of other types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
