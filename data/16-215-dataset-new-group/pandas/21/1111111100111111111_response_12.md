The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers. The function is not able to handle list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError.

The key_type is being inferred incorrectly as 'string' in all cases, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers in a way that is consistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        key = [key]
    
    # Convert key to list
    key = list(key)
    
    # Reindex with the key
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This should resolve the KeyError issue and make the function behave as expected for all cases.

This fix should address the problem described in the GitHub issue as well. It ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the inconsistency mentioned in the issue.
