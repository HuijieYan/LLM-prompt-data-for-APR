The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The function tries to identify the type of the key and perform different operations based on that type. However, there are cases where the type identification may not be accurate, leading to unexpected outcomes.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is attempting to use the `ser[key]` syntax to retrieve values from the Series `ser` using a key `key`. The test is expecting to raise a `KeyError` with a specific message, but the function fails to raise the expected error.

One potential cause of the bug could be the misidentification of the type of the `key` parameter. This may lead to the function taking an incorrect path in its logic, resulting in an unexpected outcome.

To fix the bug, we should improve the logic for identifying the type of the `key` parameter and the subsequent operations based on that type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    # Check for inappropriate usage of key
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray)):
        raise TypeError(
            f"Invalid key type: {type(key).__name__}. Indexing a Series with DataFrame or ndarray is not supported."
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Process the key based on its type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, additional checks are added to identify incorrect type usage of the `key` parameter. If the `key` is identified as a DataFrame or ndarray, a `TypeError` is raised to indicate the inappropriate usage.

With these corrections, the `_get_with` function should now be able to handle the `key` parameter correctly and perform the appropriate operations based on its type.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
