The buggy function `_get_with` is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list indexers, as reported in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]". The issue points out that list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, and there is inconsistent behavior observed when using `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]`. This inconsistency is caused by the implementation of the `_get_with` function, where the handling of list indexers is not consistent.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers consistently, leading to unexpected behaviors when trying to index a Series using a list indexer. The inconsistency is also highlighted by the inconsistency in behavior between `ser[key]` and `ser[list(key)]`.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that list indexers are handled consistently and that the behavior matches the expected outcome. The function should be modified to provide a uniform treatment for list indexers, array-like indexers, and other indexers. The corrected version of the function should handle list indexers in a manner that ensures consistent behavior and avoids raising errors when no matches are found.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        if len(key) == 0:  # Check if key is an empty list
            # If list is empty, return empty Series
            return self.iloc[0:0]
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we specifically check if the indexer `key` is a list or array-like, and then handle the case where the list is empty. If `key` is empty, we return an empty Series. Otherwise, we proceed with the indexing based on the list or array-like indexer. This approach ensures consistent handling of list indexers and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
