The bug in the function `_get_with` occurs at the line `return self._slice(slobj)`, where the function `_slice` returns a new Series by slicing the original one based on the slice index. However, the slice index is not being properly handled in some cases, leading to a KeyError.

We need to correctly handle the slice index in the `_get_with` function and return the expected result in all cases where a slice index is provided.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Locates key
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This updated function correctly handles the different types of keys and returns the desired results for slicing and indexing. After making these corrections, the function should be able to pass the failing test scenarios provided.
