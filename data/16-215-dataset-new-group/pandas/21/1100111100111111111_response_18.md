## The mistake in the buggy function
The issue appears to be related to the handling of different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) in the `_get_with` function. The function is designed to handle different indexer types, but it seems to be inconsistent in its treatment of list indexers, array-like indexers, and Index indexers. This inconsistency leads to different behavior and errors when accessing the Series using these different types of indexers.

The error message indicates that the implementation for list indexers is not consistent with other array-like indexers, causing a KeyError when attempting to access the Series using a list indexer.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
We need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, such as list, array-like, and Index, when accessing the Series. This could involve modifying the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle different types of indexers uniformly and ensure that the behavior is consistent across all types.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list) and all(not is_scalar(k) for k in key):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with a list of arrays is not supported")
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, ABCSeries, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list, array-like, Index, and tuple. It also includes additional checks to handle a list of arrays and raises an error when an unsupported operation is attempted.

This should resolve the inconsistency and ensure that accessing the Series using different types of indexers produces consistent and expected behavior.
