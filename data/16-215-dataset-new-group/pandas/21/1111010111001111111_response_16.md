The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by a discrepancy in how different types of indexers are handled. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, the function should handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that they all behave the same way. This will align with user expectations and prevent unexpected errors during indexing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not (is_list_like(key) or is_object_dtype(key)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_extension_array_dtype(key) or is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
```

In the corrected version, we use the `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions to handle different types of indexers consistently. Additionally, we ensure that the key is converted to an index using the `ensure_index` function to maintain consistency in the indexing process.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle all types of indexers consistently, preventing the unexpected errors observed in the failing tests and aligning with user expectations.

This fix also addresses the GitHub issue by resolving the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
