The bug appears to be related to the handling of list indexers differently from array-like indexers in the `Series._get_with` function of the `pandas.core.series` class. The issue is specifically with how the function handles list indexers and how it raises a KeyError when using a list indexer on a Series.

The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with a list of keys that have no matches, which results in inconsistent behavior compared to indexing with array-like or Index indexers.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers consistently with array-like and Index indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Handle list-like indexers
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert to Index if not already
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handle scalar indexers
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this version, we explicitly handle list-like indexers by converting them to an Index using the `ensure_index` function. This ensures consistent behavior when indexing a Series with array-like, Index, and list indexers.
