The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` does not handle the case where a list-like key is provided and returns a KeyError when trying to index the Series with a list key. This is inconsistent with how other indexers are handled and also differs from the behavior of list indexers when compared to array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle the list-like key appropriately and ensure consistency with the behavior of other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the case when a list key is provided
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the function can appropriately handle list-like keys and provide consistent behavior with other indexers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
