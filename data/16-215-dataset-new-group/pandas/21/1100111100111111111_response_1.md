The bug in the provided function is caused by inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. The function `_get_with` is not handling the different types of indexers correctly, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle different types of indexers consistently, ensuring that all types of indexers are treated the same way.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = key.to_list()
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function handles different types of indexers consistently, ensuring that all types are treated in the same way. This should resolve the KeyError exceptions and make the function behavior more predictable and consistent.

After applying this fix and running the failing tests, the corrected function should pass and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub.
