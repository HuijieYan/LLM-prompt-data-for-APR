The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers. The issue on GitHub suggests that there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, resulting in unexpected behavior and KeyError in certain cases.

From the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it seems that the bug occurs when handling the `key` parameter to determine the `key_type`. In certain cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, which leads to incorrect behavior further down in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined and that the function behaves consistently for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Handle different key types
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle other key types
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle unknown key type
    raise ValueError("Invalid key type for indexing")

```

In the corrected version, we added additional checks to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined based on the type of the `key` parameter. We also handle the different key types accordingly, whether it's an integer indexer, a list indexer, or other types. Lastly, we added a catch for unknown key types to raise a `ValueError` to indicate an invalid key type for indexing.
