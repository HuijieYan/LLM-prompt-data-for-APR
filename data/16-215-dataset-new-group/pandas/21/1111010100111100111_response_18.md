The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers for a Series. The issue on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior of list indexers should be consistent with other array-like indexers.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `key_type` variable in the function, as it is incorrectly identified as `'string'` instead of a valid indexer type, which leads to the inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified and used to determine the appropriate indexing method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added an additional check for the `key_type` to handle string indexers. This should address the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers with the `Series` class.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
