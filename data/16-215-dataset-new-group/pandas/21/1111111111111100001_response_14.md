The buggy function `_get_with` incorrectly identifies the type of the key provided and doesn't handle it appropriately. It tries to determine the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type. However, in some cases, the type inference fails, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and handles it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the key is a scalar or list-like and handle it accordingly. We don't rely on the type inference, which was causing the bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases mentioned earlier.
