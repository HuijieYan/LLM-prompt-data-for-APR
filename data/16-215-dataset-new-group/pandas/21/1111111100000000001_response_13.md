The issue with the _get_with function is that it contains several conditional blocks that make use of the isinstance() function. The bug seems to be with the conditional checks for the type of 'key'. Specifically, the code has some redundant or conflicting checks.

The following are the potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conditional checks for isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame) and not is_list_like(key) may potentially cause an issue.
2. The redundant type check for isinstance(key, list) in combination with the previous check may lead to an incorrect code path being taken.

The cause of the bug is the redundant and conflicting conditional checks made on the 'key' variable. This could lead to unexpected behaviors or logical errors when branching through the conditional statements.

To fix this bug, one approach would be to organize the conditional blocks in the _get_with function in a way that eliminates redundant checks and ensures a clear logical flow. The checks should be concise and non-conflicting.

Here is a corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the checks for key types have been reorganized and made more consistent. Additionally, the redundant checks and conflicting logic have been removed to ensure a clear and unambiguous logical flow.
