The bug in the function `_get_with` is related to the handling of different types of indexers, particularly with list indexers. The function is not consistent in how it handles different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs when the function tries to reindex an empty key list, which leads to a `KeyError` when the type of index is a list. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers is causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers consistently and correctly. Specifically, when dealing with list indexers, we need to handle empty key lists without raising a `KeyError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle empty list key without raising KeyError
    if not key:
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This modified function ensures that when the key is an empty list, it will return the result of reindexing, preventing a `KeyError` from being raised.

This correction should address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers, passing the failing tests and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
