The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically how the function handles list indexers. The GitHub issue indicates that list indexers are being treated differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

Given this information, the bug likely stems from the function's handling of list indexers and its failure to return the expected result when a list indexer is provided. The function may not be properly recognizing list indexers and is failing to handle them correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers. This would ensure that the function returns the expected result for list indexers, resolving the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns with the expected input/output values.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):  # handle slice indexers
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):  # handle DataFrame indexers
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):  # handle tuple indexers
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:  # handle all other cases
        # Cast the key to a list for consistent handling
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the indexer is a scalar or list-like, and appropriately handles those cases. If the indexer is not a scalar or list-like, a KeyError is raised to maintain consistency with the behavior of other indexers.

With these changes, the function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers and return the expected results, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
