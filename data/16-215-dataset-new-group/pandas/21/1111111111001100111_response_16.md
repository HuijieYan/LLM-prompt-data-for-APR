Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs when using a list as an indexer in the `ser[key]` operation. When a list is used as an indexer, it raises a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the elements are in the index, even though the behavior should be consistent with other array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle list indexers correctly. The function first checks for slice, DataFrame, and tuple indexers, but it doesn't handle list indexers properly, leading to an incorrect behavior when a list is used as an indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to handle list indexers in a way that provides consistent behavior with other array-like indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
    if not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all other cases, including ndarray and Index
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now correctly handles list indexers by using the `self.loc` accessor for list-like indexers, providing consistent behavior with other array-like indexers.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing tests pass.
