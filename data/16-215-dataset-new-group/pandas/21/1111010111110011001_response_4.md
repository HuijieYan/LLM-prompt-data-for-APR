The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing the failing test to raise a `KeyError` when attempting to use the Series object with an index that doesn't match any of the values in the Series. The bug is occurring because when the function receives a value for `key` that is a list, it does not handle the case properly and tries to reindex the Series using the list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle the case where the `key` variable is a list or an ndarray appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

        # Check if all items in the key are in the index
        if not all(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        
        # Return the values with the specified key
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly handle the case when `key` is list-like. We first check if all items in the key are in the index, and if not, we raise a `KeyError` with a message indicating which items are not in the index. If all items are in the index, we return the values with the specified key using `self.loc[key]`.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
