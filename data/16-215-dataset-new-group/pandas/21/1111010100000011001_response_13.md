Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the buggy function and a corrected version:

1. The buggy function `_get_with` takes a parameter `key` and performs various checks and operations on it, based on its type. It appears to be a method of the `Series` class that extends `IndexOpsMixin` and `NDFrame`. The expected output value of the function is not explicitly mentioned, but it seems to be related to the type and value of the variable `key_type`.

2. Potential error locations within the function include the checks for the type of `key` and the handling of the `key_type`.

3. The cause of the bug may be related to how the function handles the `key` parameter. The function checks the type of `key` and attempts to determine the appropriate operation based on its type. However, there are inconsistencies in the handling of `key` and the determination of `key_type` based on the input.

4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of `key` and determines the appropriate operation to perform based on its type. Additionally, the function should handle the `key` parameter consistently and accurately determine the `key_type`.

5. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list if it's not already
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have moved the determination of `key_type` after the check for `is_list_like(key)`. This ensures that `key` is properly converted to a list before determining its type. Additionally, the handling of `key_type` based on its value has been adjusted for consistency.

This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the analysis.
