To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case where a list-like key returns a KeyError when used to index a Series. The issue seems to stem from the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers, as noted in the GitHub issue.

To address this, we will modify the function to handle list-like keys and indexers consistently, similar to the behavior of array-like indexers. This will involve ensuring that the list type of key can be used without raising a KeyError. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle cases where the key is a scalar and transformed it into a list before proceeding with the rest of the function. This change will ensure consistent behavior for list-like keys, preventing the KeyError from being raised.

With this modification, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
