### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `key_type` variable is determined based on the input `key` parameter.
2. Depending on the value of `key_type`, different operations are performed within the function.
3. The buggy function doesn't handle the case where a list index is passed as the key correctly, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug is that the buggy function incorrectly handles list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. This inconsistency causes the `KeyError` to be raised when using a list indexer, while not raising it for other array-like indexers.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers.
2. If the input key is a list, perform the necessary operation for the list as well, to ensure consistency in behavior.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers in a consistent manner
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "string":  # Assume key type is 'string' for list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, we ensure that the function behaves the same way for both types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and fixing the bug.
