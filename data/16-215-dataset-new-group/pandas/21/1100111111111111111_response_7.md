It looks like the bug is occurring in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The issue is causing the failing tests to raise a `KeyError`, indicating that the list indexer case is not being handled correctly.

Analyzing the variables inside the function, we can see that the `key_type` is being incorrectly identified as a string in all cases, which is likely contributing to the `KeyError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the `key` parameter is correctly identified and handled. We also need to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == 'string':
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to handle different types of indexers more consistently, and the failing tests should pass. This should also address the issue raised on GitHub about inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers.
