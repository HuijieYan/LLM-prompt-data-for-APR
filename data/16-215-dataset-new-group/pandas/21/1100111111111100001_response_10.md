The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the `key_type` variable being incorrectly inferred as a string in all cases, rather than correctly inferring the key type. This causes the wrong branch of the conditional statement to be executed, leading to unexpected behavior and consequently causing the tests to fail.

A possible strategy to fix the bug is to refactor the logic for inferring the key type to ensure it correctly identifies the type of the key being used for indexing. This could involve examining the input key and determining its type using appropriate methods or functions.

Furthermore, the logic around how different types of keys are handled could be revisited to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented for each type of key.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added additional logic to correctly infer the key type for indexing and revised the handling of different key types based on the inferred type. This should address the issue and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.
