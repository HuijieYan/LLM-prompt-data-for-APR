## The bug in the original function
The bug in the original function `_get_with` is present in the handling of the key parameter when it is a list. The function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. This bug leads to a `KeyError` for list indexers when trying to index a Series, while array-like indexers behave differently.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including lists and array-like indexers. This can be achieved by updating the logic to handle list indexers in a similar manner to array-like indexers, ensuring that there is no inconsistent behavior based on the type of indexer used.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns the behavior for all types of indexers.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like and other indexers uniformly
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Convert key to list for consistent handling
        key = list(key)

    if not is_integer(key):  # Check if the key is an integer
        return self.loc[key]  # Use label-based indexing
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]  # Use positional indexing
```

The updated logic checks for list-like indexers at the beginning and handles them uniformly with other types of indexers. It then checks if the key is an integer and uses label-based or positional indexing accordingly.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now provide consistent behavior for all types of indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue for list indexers and aligning the behavior with array-like indexers. This fix addresses the bug and should resolve the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".
