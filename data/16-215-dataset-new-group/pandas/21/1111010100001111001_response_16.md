The bug in the function `_get_with` lies in the condition where the type of the `key` is checked for its type and then further processed. The bug arises when the type is incorrectly determined.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect type detection logic in the function `_get_with`. The logic to determine the type of the `key` does not cover all possible cases, leading to incorrect type detection and an incorrect return value.

To fix this bug, we can modify the type detection logic for `key` to correctly identify its type and then proceed with the necessary operations based on the type of the `key`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_array_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the type detection logic is more comprehensive, covering scalar values, lists, and other possible types for `key`. Additionally, it handles the detection of the `key` type more accurately and selects the appropriate operation to be performed based on the type of `key`.
