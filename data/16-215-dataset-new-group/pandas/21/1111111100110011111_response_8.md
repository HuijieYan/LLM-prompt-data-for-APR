To fix the bug, you need to update the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The issue is related to the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in the results. The key error is raised for the list case, but not for the array-like indexers. This inconsistency has been identified as a bug in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

The issue arises from the logic used when determining the key type and handling different types of indexers. Currently, inconsistencies exist when handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing tests. To fix this bug, you need to ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers and update the logic related to determining the key type for indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the index")
```

The changes include handling scalar key values using `is_scalar`, inferring the key type using `lib.infer_dtype`, and raising a `KeyError` for unrecognized key types. These changes help maintain consistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the correct behavior is followed for all cases. This should resolve the inconsistencies observed in the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.

By making these changes, the corrected `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
