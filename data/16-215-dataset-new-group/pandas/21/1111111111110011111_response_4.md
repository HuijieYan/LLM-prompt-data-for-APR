The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class does not handle the case where the key is a list-like object properly. When a list-like object is passed as the key to the series, it should be treated the same as other array-like indexers, but the function treats it differently, leading to an incorrect Key Error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is handled consistently for all array-like indexers, including lists, arrays, and indices.

A corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    # Handle all array-like indexers including lists
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle scalar values or non-array-like containers
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, the `is_list_like(key)` condition has been added to handle all array-like indexers, including lists. This will ensure that all array-like indexers are treated consistently, resolving the KeyError issue.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the GitHub issue by ensuring consistent behavior for all array-like indexers.
