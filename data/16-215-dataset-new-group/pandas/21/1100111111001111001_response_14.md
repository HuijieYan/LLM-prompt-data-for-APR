The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the key_type variable. It seems that the type of the key is being incorrectly inferred as a string. This is likely causing the function to return the wrong result, leading to the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and handled. We can do this by using the `np.array` function to convert the key to an array and then check its dtype to determine the key_type. If the dtype is object, then the key_type should be set to 'string'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = np.asarray(key)  # Convert key to array
    key_dtype = key.dtype
    if key_dtype == object:
        key_type = 'string'
    elif key_dtype == bool:
        key_type = 'boolean'
    elif key_dtype == int:
        key_type = 'integer'
    else:
        key_type = 'other'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that the key_type is correctly inferred based on the dtype of the key array. Furthermore, it handles the different types of keys appropriately, based on their inferred type. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected for the failing tests.
