The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles different types of indexers. The function is not handling list-like indexers correctly, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates that when using a list-like indexer, the function `ser[key]` raises a `KeyError`, whereas using other types of indexers does not raise an error.

The `_get_with` function expects the input `key` to be either a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object. However, it encounters issues when handling a list-like input, leading to the `KeyError` being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles list-like indexers and retrieves the expected values without raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```
In this corrected version, we've removed the unnecessary checks for Index and types, and handled list-like indexers directly to access the values without raising a `KeyError`. This should resolve the inconsistency and allow the function to behave as expected across different types of indexers.
