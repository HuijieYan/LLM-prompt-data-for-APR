The issue in the `_get_with` function seems to be with the type conversion of the `key` parameter. The function is not correctly handling different types of input for `key`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to add proper handling for different types of input for `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated function checks for the type of `key` and performs the appropriate action based on its type. This should address the issues encountered in the failing test cases and ensure that the function handles different types of `key` inputs correctly.
