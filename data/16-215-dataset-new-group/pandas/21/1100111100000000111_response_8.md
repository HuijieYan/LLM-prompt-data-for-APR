The issue describes the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing the Series using a list as an indexer. Based on the issue and the provided buggy function, it appears that the bug is related to the treatment of list indexers.

The buggy function `_get_with` contains conditional statements to handle different types of indexers, including list-like indexers. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers in the function, which results in unexpected behavior and inconsistency.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure consistent handling of list indexers with array-like indexers to avoid unexpected behavior and inconsistencies when accessing the Series.

Here's the corrected version of the function where we add a conditional statement to properly handle list-like indexers:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

     # Add conditional statement to handle list-like indexers
    elif is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # rest of the code remains the same
```
In the corrected version, an additional conditional statement is added to handle list-like indexers using `is_list_like(key)` and `not is_scalar(key)` to ensure consistent handling of list indexers with array-like indexers. This should address the inconsistency and unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
