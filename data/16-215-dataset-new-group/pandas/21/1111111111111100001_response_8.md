The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError to be raised when the function is called with specific inputs. The bug appears to be in the conditional logic that checks the type of the `key` parameter. It incorrectly identifies the type of `key` in certain cases, leading to the wrong outcome.

The variable `key_type` is not being properly determined in the conditional statements. It should be an indicator of the type of the key being used for the indexing. This leads to incorrect selection methods being used on the Series object, causing the KeyError to be raised.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves properly identifying the type of `key` and using the appropriate indexing method based on that type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that the type of `key` is properly identified and the appropriate indexing method is used based on that type. This should resolve the KeyError issue in the failing tests.
