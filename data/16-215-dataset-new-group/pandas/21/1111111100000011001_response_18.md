The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to the variable `key_type`. There are conditions where the `key_type` is supposed to be a string, but it is not being set correctly. 

The bug appears to be in the following section of the function:
```python
if isinstance(key, list):
    return self.loc[key]

return self.reindex(key)
```
In the above code section, there is no assignment of the `key_type` variable. This is leading to incorrect values for `key_type` in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we can explicitly set the `key_type` based on the type of `key` and handle each type properly. 

Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added an explicit assignment of `key_type` based on the type of `key`, which ensures that the variable `key_type` will have the correct value before reaching the final return. This should fix the bug and satisfy all the provided test cases.
