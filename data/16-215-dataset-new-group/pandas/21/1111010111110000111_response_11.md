The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue with how it handles different types of indexers, specifically list-like indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses a variety of indexers, including a list indexer denoted as `list`. When using a list indexer, the test should return a KeyError, but the function fails to do so and this leads to the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list-like indexers properly, resulting in an inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers like numpy arrays or pandas Index objects. This inconsistency is also highlighted in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches".

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. Specifically, the function must handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types, such as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects, to avoid the KeyError and provide a consistent experience for users.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test and resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should handle list-like indexers consistently and pass the failing test. Moreover, it will resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
