## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with buggy class
The function `_get_with` appears to be a method of the `Series` class, which is a subclass of `base.IndexOpsMixin` and `generic.NDFrame`. The function is designed to handle various types of input `key` and return the corresponding values from the Series object.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Incorrectly handling different types of input `key`.
2. Potential issue with determining the type of `key`.
3. Inconsistent handling of different types of `key`.

## Cause of the bug
The bug might be related to inconsistent handling and determination of the type of `key`, which can lead to incorrect indexing or unexpected behavior.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure consistent and explicit handling of different types of `key`.
2. Verify the type of `key` and apply the appropriate indexing method based on its type.
3. Use the built-in type checking functions provided by pandas for input `key`.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self._slice(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
            key = list(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- I have updated the conditions to check the type of `key` and handle each type explicitly.
- I am using the `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions to check for scalar values and list-like objects, respectively.
- I have replaced the explicit check for `Index` with a more general condition to handle different types of keys.
