The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it is incorrectly identifying the data type of the input `key`. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys, such as lists, arrays, and indices, and then determine the `key_type` based on the data type of the input key.

However, the bug occurs in identifying the data type of the key by using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`. This step is incorrectly identifying the data type, leading to subsequent incorrect operations based on the key type.

To fix the bug, we should use a more accurate method to determine the data type of the key. We should also handle different types of keys appropriately, such as lists, arrays, and indices, to ensure that the correct operations are carried out based on the actual data type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the list-like key here
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have explicitly handled the list-like keys and moved the relevant code to handle such keys first. This should ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the actual data type of the key, and it should resolve the issue with the failing tests.
