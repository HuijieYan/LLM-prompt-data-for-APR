## Analysis:
The `_get_with` function is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series. The failing test highlights the issue that occurs when using a list indexer, where the function raises a `KeyError` when it shouldn't.

The failing test indicates that the behavior is inconsistent when using different types of indexers like list, array, or pandas Index. The issue has been posted on GitHub, referencing the inconsistency and how it results in KeyError for list indexers specifically.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in the `_get_with` function when handling different types of indexers. The function raises a `KeyError` when a list indexer is used, which is not consistent with how it handles other indexers like array, pandas Index, or loc.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers and does not raise a `KeyError` unnecessarily. We should also pay attention to the behavior of the `ser.loc[key]` case since it is mentioned as being inconsistent in the GitHub issue.

## The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexer consistently
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key logic for handling list indexers has been updated to ensure consistent behavior with other indexers. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
