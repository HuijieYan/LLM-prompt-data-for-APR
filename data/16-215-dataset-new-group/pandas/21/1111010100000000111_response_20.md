## Analysis
The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexes and return the appropriate values. The GitHub issue mentions that there is inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers versus array-like indexers.

## Potential error locations
The inconsistency in handling list indexers versus array-like indexers could be causing the bug.

## Cause of the bug
The bug arises because the function `_get_with` is not handling list indexers and array-like indexers consistently, leading to the KeyError when using list indexers.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` consistently handles list indexers and array-like indexers. We should also consider the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` and ensure it works as expected.

## The corrected version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_array(key)
    else:
        return self._get_values_indexer(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the list and array-like indexers uniformly by using the function `_get_values_array` to return the appropriate values for both types of indexers. Additionally, we handle the scalar case separately and ensure that `ser.loc[key]` behaves as expected.
