The bug identified in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list as an indexer. The function does not handle list indexers consistently compared to other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The bug seems to be occurring when the key is a list and it is not recognized as a valid indexer, causing a KeyError to be raised. This is inconsistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers such as Index, np.array, or a scalar key. 

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The updated function should handle list indexers consistently with other indexers, as per the GitHub issue's description.

By incorporating this correction, the function should now handle list indexers like Index, np.array, or a scalar key, and the inconsistent behavior should be resolved.
