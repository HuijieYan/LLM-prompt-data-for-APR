The bug in the ` _get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different index types, specifically when using a list as an indexer. The function fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in a KeyError in some cases.

Based on the failing tests and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug is related to how the function handles list-like indexers. The function should treat all indexers consistently and not raise errors for valid cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner and avoid raising errors for valid cases. This will involve adjusting the conditional logic for handling different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function includes a check for list-like indexers using the `is_list_like` function, and then handles these indexers accordingly. Additionally, the order of checks has been adjusted to avoid errors when processing different types of indexers.

This correction should address the inconsistencies in how the function handles different types of indexers and ensure that valid cases are handled consistently without raising errors.
