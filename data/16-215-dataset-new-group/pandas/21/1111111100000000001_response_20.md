The potential error in the buggy function could be related to the conditionals. It's likely that one or more types of conditions are not being handled correctly due to differences between the type checks used.

The cause of the bug is probably due to the mismatch between the conditions and the actual types of the key variable that the function receives. The type checks `is_list_like(key)` and `not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` might not be aligning with the types they expect to handle.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the conditions and update them to accurately handle the various types of keys that the function receives. It's important to ensure that the checking of the type of `key` variables aligns with the expected types and that all edge cases are handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The updated version includes a more accurate type checking and logical flow for handling the different types of keys that the function is expected to receive. Additionally, the "not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))" condition has been replaced with "if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))" to better handle the key type checking.
