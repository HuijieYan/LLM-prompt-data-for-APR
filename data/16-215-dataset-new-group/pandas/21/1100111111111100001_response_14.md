Based on the failing test and the input/output variable values, it seems that the bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of the input `key` within the `_get_with` function.

The key_type variable is inferred to be of type 'string' in all cases, which indicates that there might be an issue with the type inference or handling. Additionally, the key_type seems to always be set to 'string' regardless of the type of the `key`.

To fix the bug, the type inference and handling of the `key` parameter should be reviewed. It seems that the key_type variable is not being correctly inferred based on the type of the input `key`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the type inference for the `key` parameter is performed using lib.infer_dtype, and the key_type variable is set based on the result of the type inference. This should ensure that the behavior of the function is consistent and correctly handles different types of input `key`.

After making these changes, the corrected _get_with function should pass the failing test cases.
