The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistencies in the behavior when using different types of indexers such as array-like, Index, Series, and list. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches".

The issue seems to stem from the handling of the list indexer in comparison to other types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies in behavior and resulting in the `KeyError` for the list indexer.

The bug is likely caused by the conditional checks for different types of indexers and the subsequent handling of these indexers, leading to an incorrect inference of the index type when using a list indexer.

To resolve the bug, the conditional checks and the handling of different types of indexers need to be revisited to ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Revisiting the conditional checks and handling of different types of indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By revisiting the conditional checks and handling of different types of indexers within the function, the corrected version aims to address the inconsistencies and resolve the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing test cases.
