The bug in the function `_get_with` is causing inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers in the `Series` class. The bug is related to how the function treats different types of indexers such as list indexers, array-like indexers, and `pd.Index` indexers.

The bug is causing inconsistent behavior, and it is not consistent with the expected behavior for different types of indexers. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and suggests that `ser.loc[key]` raises for all cases, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to handle different types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected behavior for list indexers, array-like indexers, and `pd.Index` indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        else:
            key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if the key is not list-like, and then performs the appropriate operations based on the type of the key. This ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and aligns with the expected behavior as indicated in the GitHub issue.
