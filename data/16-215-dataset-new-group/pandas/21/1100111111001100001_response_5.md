The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles the input `key`. The function is intended to return specific slices or values from the Series based on the type of `key`, but it is not handling the input correctly, leading to failures in the provided test cases.

The issue appears to be with the identification of the `key_type`, as it is always identified as `'string'` regardless of the input type. This suggests that the logic for identifying the type of `key` is not functioning correctly.

To fix the bug, the logic for identifying the type of `key` needs to be revised and improved. Additionally, the handling for different types of `key` should be adjusted to ensure that slices, values, or index reindexing are handled appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version revises the logic for identifying the type of `key` and also adjusts the handling for different types of `key` to ensure the appropriate behavior based on the input type. This revised version should pass the failing test cases.
