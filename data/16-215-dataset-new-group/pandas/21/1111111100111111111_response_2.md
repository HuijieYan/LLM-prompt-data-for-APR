The bug arises from an inconsistency in the treatment of different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` module.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the treatment of different types of indexers is consistent, and the behavior matches the user's expectations and the test cases provided in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to list-like to ensure consistent treatment
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Use loc for label-based indexing, iloc for positional indexing
    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we first ensure that the `key` is treated consistently by converting it to a list-like object if it's not already. Then, we use `loc` for label-based indexing and `iloc` for positional indexing, providing a consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

This fixed version should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and address the failing test cases.
