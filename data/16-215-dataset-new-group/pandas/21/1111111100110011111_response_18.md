The issue in the _get_with function is that when a list key is passed, it is not being handled correctly, leading to a KeyError.

The problem lies in the part of the function where it deals with different types of key inputs. The issue is that when a list key is passed, it is not being handled properly, which leads to the KeyError as observed in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like keys in the _get_with function so that it behaves consistently with other data types.

Below is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Added handling for list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this change, the _get_with function will correctly handle list-like keys and behave consistently with other data types, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.
