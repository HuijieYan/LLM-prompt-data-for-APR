The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of indexers, particularly when a list indexer is used. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers are handled and causes a KeyError in some cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug seems to occur when a list indexer is used. The function does not handle it consistently with other indexers, and this inconsistency leads to a KeyError in certain cases, such as when using `ser[list(key)]`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling list indexers to make it consistent with other types of indexers. This will involve updating the conditional statements and logic specifically related to list indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated logic to handle list indexers consistently
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently and no longer raise a KeyError in the failing test case provided. This fix addresses the reported inconsistency and should resolve the GitHub issue.
