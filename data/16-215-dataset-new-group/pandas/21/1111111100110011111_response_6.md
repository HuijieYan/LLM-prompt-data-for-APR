The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the failing test due to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. It seems that the bug occurs in the section of the code where the key is checked for its type before making decisions on how to handle it.

The cause of the bug is that when a key is a list, the function incorrectly raises a KeyError, while when the key is an array-like indexer, it doesn't raise an error.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, so they both behave consistently and do not raise KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated logic to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Fallback to reindex if the key is not of the above types
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and resolving the issue reported on GitHub. This should also make the failing test pass.
