The issue seems to be caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, the function appears to handle list indexers differently from array-like indexers.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that they all produce the same behavior and do not raise a `KeyError`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries, np.ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently and do not raise a `KeyError` as observed in the failing test. It also aligns with the expectations of the GitHub issue.

By implementing this fix, we address the inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers and ensure that they all produce the expected output without raising errors.
