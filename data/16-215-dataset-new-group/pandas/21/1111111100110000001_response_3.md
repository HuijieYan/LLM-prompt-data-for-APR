It seems that the bug has caused the test case to fail, and the error message is indicating that the key 'C' was not found in the index. 

The bug is likely related to the key indexing method `_get_with` in the Series class. The issue may be in the part of the code that tries to identify the type of the key and differentiating between positional and label-based indexers.

The `if not is_list_like(key):` check may not be working correctly, and the subsequent index handling logic seems to be insufficient.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve reviewing the logic responsible for identifying the type of the key and handling different types of indexers. Also, the handling of the 'not in index' error should be examined.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type in ['boolean', 'mixed-bool']:
        # Special handling for boolean indexing
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    # Fall back to reindex
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this correction, we handle the input 'key' to ensure that it is transformed into a list if it is not list-like. Then, the logic to identify the type of the key has been simplified and modified to handle integer, boolean, and any other key type appropriately. Lastly, the 'reindex' method is called for any other case.
