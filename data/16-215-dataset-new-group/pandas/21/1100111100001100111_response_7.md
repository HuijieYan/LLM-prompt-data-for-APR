The bug in the `_get_with` function causes inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, or index objects. The expected behavior is that all types of indexers should return the same result, but in some cases, the function raises a KeyError.

Based on the input parameter values and types and the runtime values and types of variables right before the function's return, it's evident that the `key_type` variable is being incorrectly determined as `'string'`. This incorrect determination of `key_type` leads to the function returning an unexpected result.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the `key_type` and handling different types of indexers needs to be revised. The validation for different types of indexers, such as list, array, or index object, should be streamlined to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

The corrected code efficiently determines the type of `key` and returns the appropriate result based on its type. Additionally, it handles list-like and non-scalar key values to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
