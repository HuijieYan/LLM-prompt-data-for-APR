### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The bug results in inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of objects, leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests aligning the behavior with the list case for all indexers.

Potential error locations:
1. Handling of different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series)
2. Processing and inference of the key_type

Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to align the behavior for all indexers, ensuring consistent handling and preventing `KeyError` in all cases, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like, ndarray, Index, Series indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self._get_values(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers uniformly, eliminating the potential for `KeyError` and ensuring consistent behavior for all indexers. This aligns with the suggested approach in the GitHub issue, resolving the reported inconsistency.
