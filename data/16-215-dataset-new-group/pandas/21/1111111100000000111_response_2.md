## Analysis
The `buggy` function `_get_with` is designed to retrieve values from the Series object using different types of keys including slice, DataFrame, tuple, and other types. The issue appears to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers.

## Potential Error Locations
The error may be occurring in the handling of different types of indexers and how the `reindex()` function is used.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug appears to be caused by inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The GitHub issue indicates that the way list indexers are treated may be inconsistent with array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This may involve adjusting the logic for handling different types of indexers and ensuring that the behavior is consistent across all cases.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to a list if it's not one already
    key = list(key)
    
    # Reindex if the key is not an array-like, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers consistently by checking if the key is list-like and then converting it to a list if it's not one already. We then use the `reindex()` function to handle the retrieval of values based on the key. This should address the inconsistency issue and ensure that list indexers behave consistently with other types of indexers.
