First, the bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class, which is part of the pandas library. The function fails to handle non-existent index values properly, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to access the non-existent index.

The cause of the bug is that when checking for the type of the `key`, the code always goes into the first condition, which sets `key_type` to `'string'`. This causes the subsequent conditional logic to fail when attempting to access the index. The `key_type` should be determined based on the type of the `key` and its relationship with the `self.index`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine the type of the `key` and handle it accordingly to prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we correctly determine the type of the `key` before handling it in the conditional logic. This should resolve the `KeyError` issue when accessing non-existent index values.
