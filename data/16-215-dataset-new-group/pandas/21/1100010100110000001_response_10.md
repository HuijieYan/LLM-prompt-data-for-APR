The given function `_get_with` is used for indexing a series using different methods. The error messages provided by the failing test indicate that the indexing process is not working correctly and raising a `KeyError`. The three error messages are essentially indicating the same error in different contexts (i.e, different types of keys being tested).

Based on the error message from the failing test, the issue lies with the `ser[key]` operation, which is failing to raise a `KeyError` in certain cases where it should have based on the test parameters.

Analysis:
1. The `key` might not be handled correctly leading to an incorrect indexing process.
2. The error message suggests that it is failing when indexing using a key that is not present in the index.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to check for the type of key being used, and depending on the type and its contents, the series should either be indexed using its positional or label-based index method.
2. We need to handle all the types of keys gracefully to ensure a `KeyError` is raised in cases where the key is not present in the index.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]  # Convert the key to list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer": 
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):  # Handle multiple keys
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added additional checks for different types of `key` elements and handled the decision of whether to use `loc` or `iloc` appropriately. The last case should cover and raise a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index.

After making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
