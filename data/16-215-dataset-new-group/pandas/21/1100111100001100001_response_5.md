The bug in the _get_with function arises due to the incorrect determination of the type of the key, which leads to incorrect execution paths in the code.

In the provided test cases, it is observed that the key type is incorrectly determined as 'string' in all cases, which is not accurate.

To fix the bug, the code should accurately determine the type of the key based on its structure and content, and then execute the appropriate code path.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Checking the type of key
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer" or is_integer(key):
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, the bug is fixed by accurately determining the type of the key with the help of the "is_scalar" and "is_list_like" functions, and then executing the appropriate code path based on the key type. This ensures that the function behaves correctly for different types of keys and input data.
