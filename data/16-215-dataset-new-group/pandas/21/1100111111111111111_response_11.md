Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated. The function is failing to handle a list-like indexer properly, which leads to a `KeyError` in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version handles all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that list-like indexers are treated the same as other types of indexers.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing tests pass while satisfying the expected input/output values.
