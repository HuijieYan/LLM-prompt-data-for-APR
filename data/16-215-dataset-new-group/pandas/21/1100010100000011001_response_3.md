The buggy function has a few potential error locations:
1. The `key_type` variable is being assigned without consideration for the type of `key`, which may lead to incorrect behavior.
2. The condition for checking if `key` is of type Index is not properly handling all cases, which can result in incorrect behavior.
3. The logic for handling different types of `key` is not clear and may lead to unexpected results.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the different types of `key`, which leads to incorrect determination of the `key_type` and incorrect indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling different types of `key` and properly determine the `key_type` based on the type of `key` and its content.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key_type` is properly determined based on the type and content of `key`, and the logic for handling different types of `key` is clear and concise.
