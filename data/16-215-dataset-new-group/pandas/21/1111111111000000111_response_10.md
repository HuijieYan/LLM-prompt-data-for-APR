The issue seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when used with the `Series` object. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is triggering a KeyError when using a list indexer, while the same operation with other indexers is not causing an error.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not properly handling list indexers, leading to a KeyError when trying to access elements that are not present in the index. The GitHub issue also confirms that the behavior with list indexers is inconsistent compared to other indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers and avoid the KeyError that is currently being raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index(key)`, we can handle list indexers and convert them to an Index object, which should resolve the issue of KeyError when accessing elements not present in the index.

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should properly handle list indexers and pass the failing test case, resolving the GitHub issue related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers.
