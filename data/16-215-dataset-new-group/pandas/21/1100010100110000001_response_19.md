## Analysis
The function `_get_with` appears to be designed to return a slice when given a certain type of index, raise an error when given a DataFrame, and handle keys of different types accordingly. Based on the error messages from the failing tests, it appears that the function might not handle specific key types properly and is not returning the expected result, as it is failing to raise a `KeyError`. 

## Identification of Potential Errors
- The condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` might not be catching DataFrames appropriately.
- The error message in the test indicates a failure to raise a `KeyError`, which points to an issue within the block of conditions.
- The function fails to handle the box parameter properly, leading to unexpected results.

## Bug Cause
The bug might be caused due to the conditional blocks not handling the given key type (particularly for DataFrames), which leads to an unexpected result when trying to obtain a slice or raise an error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the conditional blocks should be reviewed to ensure they handle the key types accurately, and the conversion of the `box(key)` parameter should be added according to the expected types.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = index[key]

    if key.isin(self.index).all():
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```
