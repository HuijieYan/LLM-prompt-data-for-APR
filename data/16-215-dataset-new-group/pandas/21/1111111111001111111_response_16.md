The issue here is that the `_get_with` function is not handling all indexers consistently, leading to different behaviors for different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and pandas Index objects. This inconsistency is causing the failing test because the list indexer is not being handled properly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and that they all return the expected behavior. Specifically, for the list indexer, we need to handle it in the same way as the other indexers to ensure that the correct value is returned and no KeyErrors are raised.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the check for `key_type` and eliminated the need for the `lib.infer_dtype` and `key_type` variables. We have also combined the handling of non-list-like indexers into a single else block to ensure that all indexers are treated consistently.

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should handle all types of indexers consistently and return the expected behavior, resolving the issue and passing the failing test case.
