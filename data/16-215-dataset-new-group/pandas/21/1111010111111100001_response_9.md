There are a couple of potential issues in the `_get_with` function. One issue is that the buggy code does not handle all edge cases for different types of `key` input. Another issue could be an incorrect determination of the `key_type` variable.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the `_get_with` function does not handle edge cases for different types of `key` input properly. In the failing tests, it is expected that the function should raise a `KeyError` because the key provided is not present in the index of the series. However, this is not happening, indicating that the function is not handling the input correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles different types of `key` input and raises a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        indexer = self.index.get_indexer([key])
        if indexer[0] == -1:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self._get_values(indexer)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now properly handles different types of `key` input and raises a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index.
