To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the logic for handling the key type. It currently has issues with list-like keys, causing them to behave differently from other indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By simplifying the logic to handle list-like keys, we ensure that they are treated consistently with other indexers. This should resolve the issue with different behaviors for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values. It addresses the specific issue reported in the GitHub issue, where list indexers were behaving inconsistently compared to other types of indexers.
