The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the section that handles different `key` types. The error messages from the failing tests show incorrect behavior coming from the `_get_with` function for different `key` types: `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. 

This error is likely due to improper handling of the `key` type within the `_get_with` function, resulting in unexpected behavior during indexing.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle different `key` types correctly. Additionally, the method `reindex` should be used with a more appropriate approach. The `_get_with` function should be modified to correctly handle the indexing and return the result based on the type of the `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    # handle DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    # handle tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        # handle scalar, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index
        # use reindex instead of directly returning self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By this modification, the corrected `_get_with` function should handle different `key` types correctly and resolve the behavior issues shown in the error messages from the failing tests.
