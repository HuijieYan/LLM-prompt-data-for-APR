The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the key parameter. The function is intended to handle different types of keys and perform specific operations based on the type. However, it seems to be incorrectly classifying the key type, leading to incorrect behavior.

The key_type variable is being inferred based on the key, but it is always being set as a string type, which might be incorrect in some cases. This leads to incorrect branching and potentially incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and used to determine the appropriate behavior for different types of keys.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]  # assuming string keys should be treated as labels

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if not isinstance(key, Index):
            key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = key.inferred_type

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            # boolean type should be caught by the com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
            raise TypeError("Boolean type key is not supported")

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first handle slices and string keys, then check for unsupported key types. For list-like keys, we ensure that they are converted to an Index type using `ensure_index`, which helps correctly infer the key type. Then, based on the inferred key type, we perform the appropriate operation.

This corrected version should address the incorrect behavior observed in the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as intended for different types of keys.
