The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` has a few issues. It seems to be trying to determine the data type of the key and then handle different cases accordingly. However, there are some logical errors and incorrect checks for the key type that are causing the function to fail.

The function begins by checking if the key is a slice, then a DataFrame, or a tuple, then tries to handle other cases. However, there are some logical issues with the key type checks and handling different types of keys.

From the failing test, it seems that when the key is a Series or an Index, the function should return a KeyError with a specific message. This behavior is not correctly handled in the current function.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and handles the cases of specific data types correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or another Series/Index is not supported"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for bool type
    if is_bool(key):
        raise KeyError(
            f"None of {key} are in the index"
        )

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected function, we have updated the checks for different key types, specifically the checks for DataFrame, Series, and Index. We added a check for bool type and a specific KeyError raise based on that type. We also handled the reindexing case correctly.

This correction should address the logical errors and type handling, allowing the function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
