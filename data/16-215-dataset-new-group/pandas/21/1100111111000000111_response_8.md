Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test provided, it appears that the bug occurs when using a list key for indexing a Series, resulting in inconsistent behavior and a KeyError. The issue also mentions that ser.loc[key] raises for all 4 cases, indicating that the behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug in the buggy function `_get_with` seems to be related to the handling of list-type key indexers. It appears that the function does not handle list indexers appropriately, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access the elements of the Series.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-type key indexers consistently with other types of indexers. Additionally, the function should ensure that the behavior across different indexers is consistent, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I removed the separate conditions for different types of key indexers and simplified it to handle all indexers using the `loc` method. This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and should resolve the KeyError issue mentioned in the failing test and on the GitHub issue.
