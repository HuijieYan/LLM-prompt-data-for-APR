The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter. The function contains a series of conditional statements to determine which type of `key` is being passed and to handle it appropriately. 

The failing tests indicate that the bug is likely in the section where the function checks the type of `key` and implements different logic based on the type. The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution suggest that the `key_type` is not being correctly determined or handled in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` parameter and implements the appropriate logic for each type. Additionally, we should ensure that the function returns the expected type and value for the given input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is scalar or list-like
    if is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # For other cases, perform reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have refactored the conditionals to use the `is_scalar()` and `is_list_like()` functions to simplify the logic for handling different types of input. This should ensure that the function correctly handles the input parameters and returns the expected values for the given cases.
