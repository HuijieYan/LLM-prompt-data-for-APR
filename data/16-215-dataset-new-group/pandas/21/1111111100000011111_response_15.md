To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the key is a list and ensure it behaves consistently with other types of indexers.

The bug arises from inconsistencies when indexing with a list. The GitHub issue provides an example where indexing with a list raises a KeyError, while indexing with other types of indexers does not. The goal is to make the behavior consistent across all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Treat all indexers as label-based to ensure consistent behavior
    return self.loc[key]
```

With the modification, we explicitly use `self.loc[key]` when the key is not a list-like type. For list-like keys, we convert the key to a list and then use `self.loc[key]`. This ensures consistent behavior across all types of indexers, as requested in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
