The buggy function is failing due to the wrong handling of the `key` variable, and the incorrect determination of the `key_type`.

The key issue is with handling the `key` variable, where it is first checked for different types including, slice, DataFrame, tuple, and then non-list-like types. However, there are cases such as when `key` is an Index, or list, numpy array, or an ExtensionArray. These cases are not handled correctly and lead to an incorrect determination of `key_type`.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `key` is an Index, list, numpy array, or an ExtensionArray, and handle these cases correctly to determine the `key_type`.


Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Series, Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks for Index, list, numpy array, or ExtensionArray, and handles these cases correctly to determine the `key_type`. This version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
