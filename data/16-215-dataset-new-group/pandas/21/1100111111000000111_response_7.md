## Analysis:
The failing test demonstrates that when using a list indexer, the buggy function does not handle it consistently with other array-like indexers. This inconsistency is causing the test to fail and is related to the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches".

## Error Location:
The bug is likely to be located in the section of the buggy function where it checks for the type of the key and decides how to index the Series.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of a list indexer compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. Due to this inconsistency, the failure occurs when a list indexer is used for indexing a Series.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling for all types of indexers - both array-like indexers and list indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional checks and indexing process for different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:  # Handle different indexer types
            if isinstance(key, list):
                if all(isinstance(k, Index) for k in key):
                    return self.reindex(key)
                else:
                    key = list(key)
            elif isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            elif key_type == "boolean":
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we've updated the conditional checks and made the indexing process consistent for all types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency issue and make the `_get_with` function handle list indexers correctly.
