Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is occurring when using a list as the indexer for a Series. This results in inconsistent behavior compared to using other data types, such as np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates this inconsistency and throws a KeyError when a list is used as the indexer.

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the Series class, where a special case for lists is not being handled correctly. The code attempts to reindex using a list key and results in inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made in the `_get_with` function:
- Modify the handling of the list key to ensure it behaves consistently with other data types.
- Update the code to handle the use of a list as the indexer to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should pass the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`. Additionally, this updated behavior aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue, providing consistent handling of different data types as indexers for the Series.
