To fix the bug, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the `Series._get_with` function.

The issue originates from this line of code:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```
This code incorrectly converts the indexer to a list if it is not already an instance of one of these types, which leads to inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers.

To fix this, we need to remove the code that converts the indexer to a list and instead handle the different types of indexers consistently. We can do this by checking if the indexer is an instance of `Index` and using `reindex` for all indexers that are not already instances of `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, or `Series`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will now handle different types of indexers consistently and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post. This correction ensures that list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, and Series indexers are handled without conversion, and if the indexer is an instance of `Index`, `reindex` is called to handle the indexing operation correctly.

This correction should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
