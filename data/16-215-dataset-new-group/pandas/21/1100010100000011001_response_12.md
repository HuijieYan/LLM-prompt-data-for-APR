Based on the provided buggy function, the bug appears to be within the logic for determining the type of the key. The key_type variable is being assigned as the inferred type of the key, but it seems that the logic for assigning key_type is incorrect. Additionally, there are redundant checks for isinstance(key, list) and isinstance(key, Index) which can be improved.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the logic for determining the type of the key and removing redundant checks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction removes redundant isinstance(key, list) and isinstance(key, Index) checks and corrects the logic for determining the type of the key. It also handles the case where key is an instance of ABCSeries.

The corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values specified for the buggy function.
