The issue appears to be related to the different behavior of the `Series` class when indexing with a list compared to other types such as arrays or `Index` objects. The reported inconsistency lies in the fact that in some cases, a key error is raised, while in others, the behavior is different. This issue indicates that the bug lies in how the function handles different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not handling the different types of indexers consistently, leading to unexpected behavior and key errors. It seems that the code is not properly distinguishing between the different types of indexers, leading to incorrect handling and inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle the different types of indexers consistently, in line with the expected behavior of the `Series` class when indexing with lists, arrays, or `Index` objects. It should accommodate the specific behavior expected based on the type of indexer provided.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function first checks if the key is a slice, and if so, it executes the logic to handle slice indexing. Then, it checks if the key is not list-like or if it is list-like, in which case it directly uses the `loc` function for indexing. Finally, it checks if the key is an `Index` object, and if so, it also uses the `loc` function for indexing. All other cases are handled by reindexing the key.

This corrected version provides consistent handling for different types of indexers, ensuring that the expected behavior of the `Series` class is maintained.
