The bug in the function `_get_with` is related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior. The expected behavior is that all cases, including list indexers, should return NaN if there is no match.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key. It then performs checks and decides whether to treat the key as a positional indexer (self.iloc) or a label-based indexer (self.loc). However, in some cases, this decision-making process leads to the wrong outcome, causing inconsistency in the behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like keys to ensure consistent behavior, such that all cases return NaN if there is no match.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case of list-like key
    if not self.index.isin(key).any():
        return pd.Series([np.nan] * len(key), index=key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to handle the case of a list-like key. If none of the elements in the key are present in the index, it returns a Series of NaN values corresponding to the length and index of the key. This ensures consistent behavior for all cases, including list indexers.
