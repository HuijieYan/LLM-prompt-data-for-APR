The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely causing the failure in the tests. It seems that the function is not handling the `key` input correctly, leading to a KeyError when accessing the Series object with the given key.

The bug appears to be related to how the function is handling the `key` input, where it misidentifies the type of the key as 'string' in all cases, even when it is not. This results in incorrect handling of the input, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and handles it accordingly. It seems that the `key_type` calculation should be revised to properly identify the type of `key`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using lib.infer_dtype to properly identify the type of key and handling different cases accordingly, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
