Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, it seems to be failing to handle the case where a list-like key is used to index the Series. The issue may be related to how it handles different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects. Additionally, the behavior of the function may be inconsistent with the expected behavior of the `loc` functionality.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to index the Series using a list.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to properly handle list-like keys. This can be done by implementing a consistent behavior for all types of indexers, and ensuring that the function behaves as expected when used with the `loc` functionality.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised function will handle list-like keys correctly, and ensure a consistent behavior for different types of indexers. Additionally, it addresses the issue with the expected behavior of the `loc` functionality.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
