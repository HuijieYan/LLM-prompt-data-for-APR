The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers. The Series class does not treat list indexers the same way it treats array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior and an unexpected KeyError.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be updated to handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that all cases produce the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key is first converted to an Index using `ensure_index` to handle all types of indexers consistently. This change ensures that the behavior of the function is consistent across different types of indexers, and it resolves the issue of the unexpected KeyError when using a list indexer.

By making this change, the `_get_with` function will now handle different types of indexers consistently and produce the expected results for all cases, satisfying the requirements of the failing tests and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
