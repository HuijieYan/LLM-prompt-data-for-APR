The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` input parameter in the `_get_with` function. It appears that the function is unable to correctly identify the type of the `key` input parameter, leading to an incorrect path being taken in processing the input.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` input parameter and handles it appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not a list-like type
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check if key is an Index or an array-like
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    # Reindex the key if none of the above conditions match
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This modified code ensures that the `key` input parameter is correctly identified and processed based on its type. With these changes, the function should be able to handle different types of input for `key` and avoid the key error issues observed in the failing tests.
