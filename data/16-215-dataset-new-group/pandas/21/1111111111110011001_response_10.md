The buggy function appears to be failing due to an issue with the handling of the key variable. It seems that the function is trying to determine the type of the key, but the logic for this determination may not be correct. Additionally, there may be issues with the handling of the key based on its type.

The expected values and types of variables in the failing test cases suggest that the key_type variable is expected to be a string in all cases.

To fix the bug, a potential strategy could be to revisit the logic for determining the type of the key within the function and ensure that it correctly identifies the type. Additionally, the key should be handled based on its type to avoid errors.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle cases where key is not a list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for determining the type of the key and handling the key based on its type has been revised to ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test cases.
