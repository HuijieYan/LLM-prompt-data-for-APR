The bug occurs due to the incorrect identification of the key_type. This leads to the "KeyError" that is raised during the failing test cases.

The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, and indices for indexing a Series object. However, there is an issue in identifying the `key_type` correctly, which leads to an incorrect indexing operation.

The strategy to fix the bug is to correctly identify the type of the `key` being passed and handle it accordingly. We need to make sure that the key_type is correctly inferred and then determine in the subsequent steps which indexing method to use based on the inferred key_type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
1. The correct type inference for `key` is determined, and the key_type is set based on that.
2. Based on the key_type, the appropriate indexing method is chosen (using `loc` or `iloc`) to handle the key.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys and resolve the failing test cases.
