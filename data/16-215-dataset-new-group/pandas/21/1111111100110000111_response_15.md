To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, the issue needs to be addressed where the different types of indexers (`list`, `array-like`, `Index`, `Series`) are being handled differently. 

The code should handle list indexers in a consistent manner and only raise a `KeyError` if none of the keys are found in the index. 

Given the information from the GitHub issue, it seems that the behavior for list indexers should be consistent with the other indexers. With that in mind, a strategy to fix the bug would be to modify the handling of list indexers to align with the behavior of the other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Make sure the key is an Index type

    if key.empty:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key` is converted to an Index type using `ensure_index` to ensure that it's handled consistently, and then if the `key` is empty, a `KeyError` is raised. This aligns the behavior of list indexers with array-like indexers, Index, and Series, as specified in the GitHub issue.
