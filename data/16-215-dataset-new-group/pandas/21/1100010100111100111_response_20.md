### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The condition for checking if `key` is an instance of `Index` or not.
2. The condition for checking if `key` is a list or a numpy array.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because of inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with a list-like object. The issue in the GitHub post highlights that there is inconsistency in the behavior of `ser[key]` and `ser[pd.Index(key)]` as well as `ser[np.array(key)]`. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the different types of indexers.

Based on the failing tests, it appears that the function incorrectly handles list-like indexers, causing a KeyError to be raised when it should not. The function is not handling the case of a list-like indexer properly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the function properly handles the case of a list-like indexer. This may involve checking the type and characteristics of the indexer and ensuring that the proper indexing method is called based on the type.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = "object"

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "object":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added an additional check for `is_list_like(key)` and then handling the case by converting it to a list. This should resolve the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub post and passing the failing test cases.
