The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when handling the `key` parameter, leading to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue, where the behavior of using list indexers is different from array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is related to the conditional logic for different types of `key` parameters. The function should handle the key parameter consistently for different types of indexers, but it fails to do so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic and ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we modified the conditional logic for handling different types of `key` parameters. We explicitly check for list-like and Index types, and then handle ExtensionArray, np.ndarray, and Series types. The key_type is inferred using `lib.infer_dtype`, and the corresponding actions are taken based on the inferred type. This should resolve the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure consistent behavior as expected.
