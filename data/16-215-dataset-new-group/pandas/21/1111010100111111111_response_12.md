The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The bug is causing a KeyError to be raised when using a list-type key for indexing, while it should behave consistently with other indexers.

The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function, leading to a KeyError being raised in the case of a list, but not for other indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the case of list-like indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like indexers separately and apply the `loc` function to return the values based on the key.

This approach ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
