The cause of the bug is that when the key is a list, the function is not handling it properly. This inconsistency has been identified through the failing test and is also mentioned in the GitHub issue. The failing test shows that using a list as the key results in a KeyError, while the other types of indexers work without issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case when the key is a list in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. The function should not raise a KeyError when a list key is used.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle list keys properly and pass the failing test. This will also ensure consistency in the behavior of the function across different types of indexers, as requested in the GitHub issue.
