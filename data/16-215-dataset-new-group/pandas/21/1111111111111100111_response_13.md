To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The issue lies in the conditional statements that handle different types of indexers, particularly when dealing with lists.

In the failing test case, the error message indicates that the key type "Index(['C'], dtype='object')" is not found in the index, leading to a KeyError. This suggests that the bug is related to how different indexers are handled by the `_get_with` function.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)) and key.dtype.type is np.bool_:
            raise ValueError("iLocation based boolean indexing cannot use an indexable as a mask")
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we've added additional checks and logic to handle different types of indexers consistently. We also added a specific check for boolean indexing with `np.ndarray` and `ExtensionArray` to prevent unexpected behavior.

These changes should ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves consistently regardless of the type of indexer used, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
