The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)` within the `Series` class. The function handles different types of indexers and returns the appropriate values based on the type of indexer provided. The issue arises when using a list as an indexer, as it results in a KeyError when none of the items in the list are found in the index.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the list indexer case correctly, leading to a KeyError when none of the items in the list are found in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled, as they do not raise a KeyError in the same scenario.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the list indexer case in a way that is consistent with other types of indexers. It should return NaN for items in the list that are not found in the index, instead of raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    result = self.loc[key]
    if isinstance(result, Series):  # Check if result is a Series
        result.loc[~result.index.isin(key)] = np.nan  # Set values not in the index to NaN

    return result
```

In the corrected version, after obtaining the result using `self.loc[key]`, it checks if the result is a Series and then sets the values not in the index to NaN. This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including lists, and will resolve the KeyError issue identified in the failing test.
