The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers and the inconsistency in the behavior. This inconsistency is causing the failing of the tests related to indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function. The function checks for the type of the indexer and makes decisions based on that, but the handling of list-like indexers is not consistent with other types of indexers, leading to the KeyErrors.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and that the behavior is aligned with the expected behavior for indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing with slices or DataFrames is not supported, use appropriate indexer")
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles different types of indexers consistently and aligns the behavior with the expected behavior for indexing a Series. It should address the inconsistencies and fix the failing tests related to indexing a Series.
