The bug in the function `_get_with` lies in the handling of list-like indexers. When using a list as an indexer, the function is supposed to behave consistently and raise a KeyError if there are no matches in the index. However, the current implementation does not handle the list case correctly and raises a KeyError with an inconsistent error message.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the function handles list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers and raises a KeyError with the correct message if there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers consistently
    if not any(self.index.isin(key)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to ensure that if none of the elements in the list indexer `key` are present in the index, a KeyError is raised with the appropriate error message, as expected in the failing test cases.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and behave consistently when handling list-like indexers.
