The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function include:

1. The use of `self._convert_slice_indexer`, which might result in incorrect slicing.
2. The conditional check for `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` might miss checking for some valid types.
3. The use of `self.index._should_fallback_to_positional()` may not correctly determine whether to treat the indexer as positional or label-based.

The bug in the function stems from potential incorrect slicing and ambiguous handling of the indexer based on its type and inferred type.

To fix the bug:

1. Ensure correct slicing by directly slicing the Series with the given indexer.
2. Use an exhaustive check for the type of the passed indexer to accurately determine the correct action.
3. Avoid ambiguities by using clear conditional checks for different types of the indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            return self[key]
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the function now directly slices the Series when the `key` is of type `slice`. It then uses an exhaustive conditional check to accurately determine the correct course of action for other types of keys, preventing any ambiguities and ensuring correct indexing and slicing.
