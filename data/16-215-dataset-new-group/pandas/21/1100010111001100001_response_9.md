The issue with the current implementation is that it is not correctly handling the case where the key is not found in the index of the Series. The function is incorrectly trying to infer the type of the key and then returning either the result of `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]` based on the type inferred.

The bug occurs because when the key is not found in the index, the function incorrectly infers the key type as 'string' and then proceeds to return the result of `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]` based on this type. This leads to a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to first check if the key is present in the index, and if not, raise a KeyError explicitly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key.inferred_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
        if key in self.index:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function first checks for the presence of the key in the index and raises a KeyError if the key is not found. If the key is found, it proceeds to return the result of `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]` based on the type of the key.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function handles cases where the key is not found in the index properly.
