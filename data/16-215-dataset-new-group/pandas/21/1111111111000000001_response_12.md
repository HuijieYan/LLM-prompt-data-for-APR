The buggy function `_get_with` seems to have a conditional structure, but the conditions might not be working as expected. It also has a case for handling the key as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, which could be related to the failing test in `test_getitem_no_matches`. The failing test seems to be checking for the error message when a key is provided that does not match any index values.

The potential issue in the `_get_with` function could be due to the conditional checks not properly handling the various types of keys that can be provided. Specifically, the problematic code could be the part where it handles the `list`, `np.array`, `Index`, or `Series` key types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` correctly handles all possible types of keys and returns the expected result in each case. It's also important to handle the scenario where the key provided does not match any index values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if np.isscalar(key) and not is_string_dtype(self.index):
        try:
            return self._get_value(key)
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f'Key not found: {key}')

    # handle list-like keys
    keyarr, indexer = self._get_listlike_indexer(key, axis=0)
    return self._get_values(keyarr)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the key is a scalar but not a string type by trying to get the key's value. If it's unsuccessful, we raise a `KeyError`. For list-like keys, we retrieve the key's values using the `_get_values` method.

This should address the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` passes.
