The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class causes the inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list. The function incorrectly handles the list case, resulting in a KeyError when trying to index a Series with a list containing no matches.

The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles the case when indexing with a list. It results in a KeyError instead of a NaN value for the non-matching elements.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case of indexing with a list correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is list-like
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will now handle the case of indexing with a list correctly, and it should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
