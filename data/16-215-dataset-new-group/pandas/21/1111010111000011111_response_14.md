This bug is causing inconsistency in the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The issue is that when using a list-type indexer, the function raises a KeyError for cases in which it should not. The cause of the bug is likely due to the different ways the function handles different types of indexers, leading to an inconsistency in behavior.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function treats all types of indexers consistently and does not raise unnecessary errors for list-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "string":  # Added handling for string type
               return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should now handle indexers of different types consistently and not raise unnecessary errors, meeting the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
