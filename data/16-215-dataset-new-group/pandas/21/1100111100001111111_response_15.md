The issue is related to the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the pandas Series. When using list indexers, the behavior is different from using array-like indexers, which leads to discrepancies and inconsistencies. This is observed in the test cases and highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The bug in the `_get_with` function can be attributed to the improper handling of different types of indexers, especially list indexers. The current implementation does not handle list indexers properly, leading to the discrepancy observed in the test cases.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be proposed to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This can be achieved by reviewing the logic that determines the type of indexer and applying the appropriate operations to handle each type consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and the identified bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, pd.core.indexes.base.Index):
        # handle both Index and Index subclasses
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        # Positional indexer
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:  # Label-based indexer
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the key_type is properly determined based on the type of the key, including handling both Index and Index subclasses. The logic for distinguishing between positional and label-based indexers is revised to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers.

This approach addresses the bug and ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
