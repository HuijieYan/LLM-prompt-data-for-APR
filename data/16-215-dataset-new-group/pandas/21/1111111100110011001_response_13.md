The buggy function is failing because it is not returning the expected KeyError when indexing the Series with a box. It seems that the key_type variable is not being assigned the correct value, resulting in the wrong behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the key_type variable should be assigned the correct value based on the type of the key being passed to the function. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the key is a box (list, np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series) and raise a KeyError as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the case when the key is a box (list, np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series) and raise the expected KeyError. This should fix the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
