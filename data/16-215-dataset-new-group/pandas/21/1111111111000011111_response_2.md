The issue with the `_get_with` function is related to the different indexing behaviors between list, array-like, and Index indexers. The bug causes inconsistency in the behavior of the function when using different types of indexers, resulting in KeyError for the list case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list indexers. The logic for handling different types of indexers should be adjusted to avoid the inconsistency in behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We treat all indexers as label-based to avoid inconsistency
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we handle all indexers as label-based to ensure consistent behavior. Additionally, the adjustment in logic accounts for the inconsistency observed when using list indexers.

This should fix the bug and make the function behave consistently across different types of indexers, passing the failing test and meeting the expected input/output values specified in the GitHub issue.
