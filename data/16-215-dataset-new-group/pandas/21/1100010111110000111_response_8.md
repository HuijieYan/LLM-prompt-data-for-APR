The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers used in the `ser[key]` operation. Specifically, when the key is a list-like object, a KeyError is being raised, which is inconsistent with the behavior for other types of indexers such as an array, index, or Series.

The cause of this bug is rooted in the conditional block:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
This condition is trying to handle scalars that aren't recognized by `lib.is_scalar` and returning `self.loc[key]`. However, this logic is causing an error for list-like indexes, as observed in the failing test, and further explained in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the conditional block handling list-like keys should be removed, and instead, the behavior should be unified as in the other indexers. The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By removing the conditional block for handling non-list-like keys, the corrected version should now consistently handle different types of key indexers and pass the failing test case, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
