The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for determining the type of the `key` parameter and then taking different actions based on its type. However, the current implementation has several issues that lead to incorrect behavior. The function checks for various types of `key`, including slice, DataFrame, tuple, and list-like objects, but the logic is convoluted and can lead to unexpected results.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers correctly, which is highlighted in the GitHub issue. The function needs to handle list indexers in a consistent manner to avoid unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should first handle the list indexers properly and then ensure that the type of the `key` parameter is correctly determined to avoid any inconsistencies.

Based on the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue, the following corrected version of the function is provided:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, a separate condition is added to handle list indexers, ensuring that they are treated consistently. Additionally, the type determination logic has been made clearer to avoid unexpected behavior. This should resolve the bug and align with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
