The issue here is that the function `_get_with` in the `pandas.core.series` module is not handling the case when a list is passed as an indexer and no matches are found. This results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the case when a list indexer has no matches in the index, which leads to a KeyError being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case when a list is passed as an indexer and no matches are found. We can modify the function to check for this case and handle it in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a try-except block for the case when a list indexer is used and no matches are found. If a KeyError is raised in this case, it is caught and re-raised with a custom message to indicate that none of the specified keys are found in the index.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers with no matches in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
