Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the inconsistent behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is an object of different types (e.g., list, index, array-like). The bug is specifically causing a KeyError when attempting to access elements with certain types of indexes.

Here's the analysis and steps for fixing the bug:

1. Analyze the relationship with related functions, test code, and the GitHub issue: The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistent behavior of the `ser[key]` operation for different types of indexes and suggests that the behavior should be consistent across all cases.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The buggy function `_get_with` might be failing to handle certain types of indexes correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

3. Cause of the bug: The `_get_with` function is not handling the index type consistently, leading to a KeyError in some cases. This inconsistency is also mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug: 
   - Update the `_get_with` function to handle index types consistently and ensure that it doesn't raise a KeyError for any valid index type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)

# Add try except block to catch KeyError
try:
    return self.reindex(key)
except KeyError:
    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version includes a try-except block to catch the KeyError when reindexing the series with the `key` and then raise a meaningful error message that indicates which key is not found in the index.

By applying these changes, the corrected version should handle different types of indexes more consistently and pass the failing test case.
