Based on the GitHub issue and the buggy function, it seems that the bug occurs when using a list indexer with no matches, as it raises a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers, which do not raise a KeyError when no matches are found.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers differently, ensuring that it does not raise a KeyError when no matches are found.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # Updated the condition to handle list indexers differently
            if isinstance(self.index, (Index, MultiIndex)) and not self.index.isin(key).any():
                return self.reindex(key)
            else:
                return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to handle list indexers differently, ensuring that it returns a reindexed Series if no matches are found in the index. This aligns the behavior with array-like indexers and resolves the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
