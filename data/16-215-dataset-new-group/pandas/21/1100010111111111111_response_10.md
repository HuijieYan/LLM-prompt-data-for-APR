The issue here is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the case of a list-like key properly, resulting in a KeyError being raised when it should not. The key_type is being incorrectly inferred as 'string' instead of 'object', which is causing the incorrect behavior.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the type of the key is correctly identified as a list-like object and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "object"):  # handle the 'object' case
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking if the key is list-like and converting it to a list, we ensure that it will be handled properly in the rest of the function. Also, we handle the 'object' case specifically to avoid the KeyError that was being raised.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and behave as expected.
