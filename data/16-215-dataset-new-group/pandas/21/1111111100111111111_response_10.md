The bug in the `_get_with` function may be occurring due to the difference in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers. Here is a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. When receiving an index type that is a list, the function should handle it consistently with the other array-like indexers.
2. Ensure that the error message raised by the function matches the behavior for all different types of indexers (list, array, Index, Series).
3. Take into account the behavior of the `ser.loc[key]` for all cases and align the behavior of the `_get_with` function to match it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By implementing this corrected version, the issues with inconsistent behavior among different indexers and error messages are addressed. This version also ensures that all cases, including different types of indexers, behave consistently and avoid raising errors.
