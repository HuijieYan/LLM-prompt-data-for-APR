The bug in the provided function seems to be due to the incorrect handling of the `key` variable within the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in pandas.

The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the case when `key` is a list or an ndarray, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` method to handle the case when `key` is either a list or an ndarray. We should extract the values from the list or ndarray, and then perform the necessary operations on those values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Extract values from list or ndarray
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        key = list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    ...
    # rest of the code remains the same
```

The corrected version adds a conditional check to handle the case when `key` is a list or numpy ndarray. It then goes on to handle the extraction of values from the list or ndarray before performing the necessary operations.

With this correction, the `_get_with` method should now be able to handle the different types of input key scenarios, and the failing test cases should now pass.
