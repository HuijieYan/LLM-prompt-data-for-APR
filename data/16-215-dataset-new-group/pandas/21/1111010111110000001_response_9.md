The failing test titled `test_getitem_no_matches` attempts to index a Series with a key that isn't present in the index of the Series. The function `_get_with` is buggy because it is not detecting this type of error and not raising a KeyError as expected.

The possible error locations within the `_get_with` function are:
1. The conditional check at the beginning of the function, which tries to determine the type of `key` and act accordingly.
2. Checking for the type of `key` in the middle part of the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not identifying the case where the key provided for indexing does not exist in the Series index. This causes the test to fail and the function not to raise the expected KeyError.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the code paths inside the `_get_with` function correctly handle the case where the provided key does not exist in the index, and raise a KeyError in those scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key in self.index or str(key) in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key in self.index or str(key) in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")
```
In the corrected version of the function, additional conditional checks are added to ensure that when accessing an element with an index, the function checks for the existence of the key in the index and raises a KeyError if the key does not exist. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected in scenarios where the key is not present in the index.
