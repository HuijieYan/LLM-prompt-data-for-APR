Based on the provided information, here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, ABCSeries)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)

```

The bug was caused because the function was not handling all potential input types effectively. By ensuring that the input key is converted to an index using `ensure_index`, we can avoid the KeyError issue that was causing the failing tests.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
