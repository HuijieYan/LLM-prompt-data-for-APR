Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The function seems to treat list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and a KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

The cause of the bug is that the function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and a KeyError when using a list as an indexer, as highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including both list and array-like indexers. This could be done by checking the type of the indexer and handling it uniformly for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Uniform handling for all indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring uniform handling for all types of indexers and using the `ensure_index` function to standardize the indexer, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

Please note that the corrected version provided assumes that the `ensure_index` function can be used to standardize the indexer. If this assumption is not valid, an alternative approach should be taken to ensure uniform handling of all types of indexers.
