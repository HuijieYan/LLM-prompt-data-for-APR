The bug appears to be occurring at the portion of the function where the type of the `key` parameter is being determined. This type is then used to determine how the key should be used to access data within the `self` Series object. 

The function currently fails when the type of the key is determined to be `'string'` in all cases, and it leads to incorrect behavior when trying to access the data.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and use the appropriate method to access the data within the Series object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Use the correct method to determine the type of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype([key], skipna=False)

    if key_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle the case when the key is a list

    return self.reindex(key)  # Reindex the data with the new key
```

By correctly determining the type of the key and using the appropriate methods to access the data within the Series object, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests.
