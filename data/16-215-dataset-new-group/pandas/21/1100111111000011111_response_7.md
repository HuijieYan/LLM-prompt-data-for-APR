The issue arises from inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `ser[key]` operation. The specific issue occurs when using `ser[list(key)]`, which raises a `KeyError` while the other array-like indexers do not.

The cause of the bug is that when `key` is a list, the buggy function doesn't handle it appropriately, leading to the `KeyError` when attempting to access the key.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list indexers consistently with the other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by explicitly handling the case when `key` is a list like it handles numpy arrays, and indices.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

 
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the list-like indexing consistently with array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers, resolving the issue noted in the GitHub post and passing the failing test case.
