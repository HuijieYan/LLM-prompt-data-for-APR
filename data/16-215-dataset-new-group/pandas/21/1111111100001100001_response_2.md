The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it incorrectly infers the `key_type` as "integer" when it should be inferring it as "string" because the input key is a list of strings, not integers. This leads to the function attempting to use integer-based indexing instead of label-based indexing when it encounters a non-integer input.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly infer the type of the key and use label-based indexing for non-integer inputs.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if not is_integer(key) and not is_bool(key) and not is_categorical_dtype(key) and not is_extension_array_dtype(key) and not is_iterator(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I updated the condition for inferring the key type. Now, it checks if the key is non-integer and not of specific data types, to determine the key type as "string". Additionally, it utilizes label-based `loc` indexing for label-based keys and positional-based `iloc` indexing for positional keys, ensuring the correct indexing type based on the key type.
