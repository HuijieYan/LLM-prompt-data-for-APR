The bug in the `_get_with` function can be attributed to the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. When a list indexer is used, the code raises a `KeyError` indicating that none of the items in the index are present in the list. This is inconsistent with the behavior when using other array-like indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers, and that `ser.loc[key]` behaves consistently for all cases.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with this type of key is not supported"
        )
```

This corrected version ensures that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers, and it also handles the case of other array-like indexers by using `self.loc[key]` rather than raising a `KeyError`.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository and ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
