The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from other indexers. The GitHub issue describes this inconsistency and suggests that the behavior of `ser[list(key)]` should be consistent with `ser[key]` and `ser[np.array(key)]`.

The bug occurs when using a non-existent key in the form of a list, leading to a `KeyError`. The key type remains as `'string'` regardless of the input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with other indexers. We can modify the code to handle list indexers in a similar manner to array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Check if the key is a scalar and handle it
        if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
            return self.reindex([key])  # Reindex with the single scalar key

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we check if the key is a scalar and not present in the index. If so, we reindex the Series with the single scalar key. This change ensures that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with other indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
