Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The issue is that when using a list indexer, a KeyError is raised, while the behavior is consistent for other types of indexers.

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function, specifically in the section handling the conditions for different types of indexers. This causes inconsistent behavior when using a list indexer.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Reindex the Series using the key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the behavior of list indexers is consistent with array-like indexers, and it avoids the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. This should resolve the bug and provide consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
