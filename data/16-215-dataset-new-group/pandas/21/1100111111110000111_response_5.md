To resolve the bug, we need to address the mismatch in behavior between different indexers, specifically when using a list as an indexer in the `ser[key]` operation. The failing test indicates that the error is due to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers like a list, array, index, and series.

The cause of the bug is due to the mismatch in behavior between different types of indexers. The failing test specifically checks the behavior when using a list indexer, which results in a `KeyError` while using other indexers like array, index, and series does not result in the same error.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the list indexer case properly to provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This involves modifying the `_get_with` function, specifically the logic around handling different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, we have made modifications to correctly handle the list indexer case and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This fix should address the inconsistency in behavior and resolve this issue as reported in the GitHub issue.

After applying this patch, the corrected function should pass the failing test and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

By making these changes, the issue reported in the GitHub should be resolved, and the function should now behave consistently regardless of the type of indexer used.
