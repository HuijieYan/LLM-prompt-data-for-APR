The bug in the function `_get_with` of the `Series` class is that it incorrectly infers the `key_type` and then attempts to handle the index according to this incorrect type inference.

The incorrect key_type inference is happening due to the use of `lib.infer_dtype` which is inferring the type incorrectly. This is causing the function to incorrectly handle the index and return the wrong result.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly infer the type of the `key` variable in the function `_get_with`. We can achieve this by explicitly checking the type of the key variable and handling it accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Explicitly handle the different types of key
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, int) or (isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim == 0):
        return self._get_value(key)
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
```

This corrected version explicitly checks the type of the key variable and handles it accordingly, preventing incorrect type inference and incorrect handling of the index.
