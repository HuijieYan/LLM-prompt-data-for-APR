## Analysis
The buggy function has multiple potential error locations, including:
- Incorrect handling of different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and non-list-like keys.
- Inconsistent checks for key types, resulting in potential misinterpretation of the key type.
- Inadequate handling of different key types, leading to incorrect indexing and potential errors.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the function arises from the inconsistent and inadequate handling of different key types, leading to potential misinterpretations of the key type and incorrect indexing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to consistently and accurately handle different types of keys, ensuring that the correct indexing method is used for each key type.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, the function checks for slice, dataframe, tuple, and single-key types first. Then, it checks if the key is not list-like or a scalar, in which case it uses the `loc` method for indexing. If the key is of type list, numpy array, extension array, series, or index, it uses the `reindex` method for indexing. This approach ensures that each key type is handled appropriately for indexing.
