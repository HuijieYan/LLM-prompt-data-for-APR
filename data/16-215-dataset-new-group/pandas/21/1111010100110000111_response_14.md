### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function `_get_with` has multiple conditionals that check the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. 
2. The error may be occurring in the conditional that deals with `list` type keys, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Explain the cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when using a list-type key to index a `Series` object. This results in inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers such as array-like or `Index` keys.

When using a list-type key, it should produce the same behavior as array-like indexers or `Index` keys; however, the current implementation is causing a `KeyError`.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `if not is_list_like(key):` conditional block should be updated to handle list-type keys properly, producing the same behavior as array-like indexers or `Index` keys.

### Provide a corrected version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle list-type key properly
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # rest of the code remains the same
```
This corrected version handles list-type keys properly by using `self.loc[key]` to index the `Series` object when `key` is a list, ensuring consistent behavior across different indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
