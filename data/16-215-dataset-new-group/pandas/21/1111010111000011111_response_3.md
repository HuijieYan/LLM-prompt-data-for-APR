To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the code to handle the case when a list-like key is passed to the function. Based on the failing test case and the expected input/output values, it appears that the code is not properly handling the list-like key when it's passed to the function.

The cause of the bug is related to how the function handles list-like keys and the inconsistency in the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The failing test case demonstrates that when using `ser[list(key)]`, it raises a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the indices are in the Series, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys. We can update the code to treat list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, such as arrays and Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert list-like key to a list
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "floating"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we address the handling of list-like keys by converting them to a list if they are not already one, and then classify the type of key (e.g., integer, string, floating) to determine which indexing method to use (`loc` or `iloc`). This approach ensures consistent treatment of list-like keys and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.

By making these modifications, the corrected `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test case and behave consistently with all types of indexers, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
