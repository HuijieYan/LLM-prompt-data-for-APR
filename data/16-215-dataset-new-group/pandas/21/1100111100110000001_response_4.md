The bug in the provided function is that it primarily fails to handle the reindexing and key-specific cases correctly. The error messages clearly indicate that the bug is related to the function not handling the key argument properly and ultimately resulting in a KeyError.

The potential error locations within the function are in the condition checks for the type of the key and the corresponding logic for different key types. Specifically, the `_get_with` function does not properly handle the reindexing of keys, which seems to be the root cause of the failing tests.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the conditions and type checks in the `_get_with` function and ensure that the proper reindexing is performed based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

``` 

In the corrected version, we have handled the different key types, including reindexing appropriately based on the type of the key, thereby resolving the bug and making the function pass the failing tests.
