The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) and not properly recognizing certain indexers when trying to access the Series with them. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError being raised for list indexers but not for other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that the appropriate behavior is applied regardless of the indexer type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
        key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the input `key` is converted to an index using `ensure_index()` to handle different types of indexers consistently. We then proceed with the appropriate behavior based on the inferred type of the index.

By making these modifications, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of indexers consistently and resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
