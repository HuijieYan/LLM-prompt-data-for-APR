The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class arises from the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates that the function raises a `KeyError` when accessed with a list indexer compared to other types of indexers.

The issue arises due to the handling of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the section of the function that handles list-like indexers is causing the KeyError to be raised.

To fix this bug, the handling of list-like indexers needs to be adjusted to align with the behavior of other types of indexers. The function should handle list-like indexers in a manner similar to how it handles array-like and Index indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should resolve the issue:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```
With this correction, the function will handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the failing test cases.
