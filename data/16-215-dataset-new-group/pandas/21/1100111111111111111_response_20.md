The bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be caused by a discrepancy in how list indexers are treated compared to other indexers. This is leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing elements in a Series. To fix this bug, we will need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the fix implemented:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Ensure key is always treated as list-like
    key = ensure_index(key)

    # Handle the case when a key has no matches
    if is_list_like(key):
        filtered_key = [k for k in key if k in self.index]
        if not filtered_key:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
        return self.loc[filtered_key]
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that `key` is consistently treated as list-like. We filter the key to only include elements that exist in the series index, and if none are found, we raise a `KeyError` to signify that none of the elements in the key are in the series index.

This fix should resolve the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases.

After implementing this fix, the failing test should pass, and the expected input/output values should match. The issue on GitHub should also be resolved with this fix.
