The buggy function `_get_with` is not correctly handling the input key in certain cases, leading to inconsistencies and errors, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling different types of indexers properly, leading to inconsistencies in behavior and errors when trying to access elements.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to ensure that all types of indexers are treated consistently and that errors are properly handled. This includes handling list, array-like, and index indexers in the same way to avoid inconsistencies and errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently and that errors are properly managed, addressing the inconsistencies and errors reported in the GitHub issue.
