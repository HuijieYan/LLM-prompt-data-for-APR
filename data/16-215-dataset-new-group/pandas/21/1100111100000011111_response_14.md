## Analysis
The `_get_with` function takes a key and acts based on the key's type. There are several conditional checks for different types of keys and their corresponding actions. However, there seems to be an inconsistent behavior in handling different types of keys, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug
The bug seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior when the key is of type list. The function does not handle list type keys correctly, which results in unexpected behavior and errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to handle list type keys appropriately, considering the inconsistencies reported in the GitHub issue. Additionally, we need to ensure that the key type is determined correctly and consistently for all cases.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version of the function, I added a conditional block for handling list type keys. This block returns the result of `self.loc[key]` when the key is of type list, aligning with the behavior described in the GitHub issue. Additionally, I removed redundant checks and ensured that `key_type` is determined consistently for all cases.
