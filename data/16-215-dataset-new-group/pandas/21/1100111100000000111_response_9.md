## Analysis
The issue in the provided buggy function is related to the handling of different types of indexers - list, array-like, and Index. It is causing inconsistency when accessing Series elements with these different types of indexers.

## Identified Potential Error Locations
1. The check for `list_like(key)` might be causing the issue when accessing the value using a list as the indexer.
2. The handling of different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) seems to be inconsistent.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior when accessing Series elements using different types of indexers.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. The bug can be fixed by revisiting the logic for handling different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) and making it consistent.
2. Correctly validating the indexers to ensure that the correct value is retrieved for all types of indexers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check for list-like indexer
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Handle the case for list indexers
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self._handle_list_indexer(key)
        
        # Handle other list-like indexers
        elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            
            if key_type == "integer":
                # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
                # or label-based indexer
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            # Handle scalar values
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Handle non-list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
1. The logic for handling list-like indexers has been separated to ensure proper handling.
2. The handling of different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) has been made consistent.
