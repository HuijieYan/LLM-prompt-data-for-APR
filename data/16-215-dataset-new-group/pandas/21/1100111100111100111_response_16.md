The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)`, and it fails to handle list indexers correctly, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers correctly, which leads to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. The failing test scenarios do not raise a KeyError when using list indexers, while they do when using other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers, so that the behavior is consistent.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
 
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a step to convert the key to a list for handling list-like objects uniformly. This change ensures that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. This should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub thread and make the function behave as expected in all scenarios.
