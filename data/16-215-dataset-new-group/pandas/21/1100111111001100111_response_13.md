The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the case of a list-like `key` correctly, causing it to fail the test when `ser[key]` is called.

Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the behavior for list indexers should be consistent with array-like indexers. The proposed fix is to make all of these cases behave like the list case.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle both list-like and non-list-like keys correctly, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
