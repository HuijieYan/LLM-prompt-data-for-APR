The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the input values correctly, leading to the failing test cases. The function is expected to handle different types of input values such as lists, arrays, indices, and series, and perform appropriate checks and transformations based on the input type. 

There are several issues in the function:
1. The function does not correctly handle the case when `key` is a list or array of strings.
2. It does not handle the case when `key` is an Index object.
3. The variable `key_type` is assigned based on the inferred type of `key`, but this may not be accurate or sufficient for processing different input types.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the different types of input and perform appropriate checks and transformations for each type. Additionally, the `key_type` should be determined based on the type of input, rather than inferring it.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = "array"
    else:
        key_type = "other"

    # All string types, consider using loc
    if key_type == "object":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # All other array-likes (except Index), reindex
    if key_type == "array":
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Default return
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected function accounts for various input types, including lists, arrays, and indices, and applies the appropriate processing based on the type. This should fix the issues identified in the failing test cases.
