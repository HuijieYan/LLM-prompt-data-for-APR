The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the `key_type` variable, which is being incorrectly assigned the value `'string'` in all the failing cases. The `key_type` is supposed to be assigned based on the type of the `key` input parameter. 

The bug appears to stem from the condition where `key_type` is being determined. Specifically, the bug could be arising from the line:
```python
key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```
This line is likely incorrectly inferring the data type of the `key` variable and not setting `key_type` appropriately for the subsequent conditional branches.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data type inference is accurate. We can consider using the data type of the `key` variable directly in the conditional checks rather than inferring it using a function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = type(key).__name__

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "int":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we directly use the type of the `key` parameter to determine `key_type` instead of inferring it from the data. This should ensure that `key_type` accurately reflects the type of `key`, which was causing the bug. After making this change, the function should satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
