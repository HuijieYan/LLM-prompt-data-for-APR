The issue here is that when a list is used as an indexer for a Series, it is treated differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is specifically testing the behavior with lists, arrays, Index, and Series as indexers. The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError with a specific message, but the bug is causing inconsistent results, leading to the test failure.

The root cause of the bug is in the `_get_with` function. The if-elif-elif block is not handling the list-like indexers correctly. It fails to properly handle list-like indexers, leading to incorrect behavior and the KeyError being raised incorrectly.

To resolve the bug, the code in the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list-like indexers properly. It should treat lists the same way it treats other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # If key is an array-like indexer or a list-like indexer, handle it consistently
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the handling of list-like indexers has been modified to ensure consistent behavior with other array-like indexers. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test case.
