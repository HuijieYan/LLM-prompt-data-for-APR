The problem with the function `_get_with` is that it is an internal function in the pandas library. The specific bug is being triggered when passing a series with no matching indices. The function is not handling all input types correctly, leading to an incorrect behavior and raising a `KeyError` exception.

The potential error locations within the function are the conditional statements and type checking for the input `key`. The function tries to identify the type of the input key and perform different actions based on its type, but these checks are not handling all scenarios correctly, leading to the failure of the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that, when calling `ser[key]`, the type of `key` is not being correctly resolved to handle the input type of `key`, which causes it to enter an unexpected code branch. This results in a `KeyError` when accessing the Series with an invalid key.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to make sure that the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` parameter and handles it with the appropriate actions. This would involve revisiting the conditional statements and type checking within the function and ensuring that all relevant types of keys are handled appropriately.

The corrected version of the function would be:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_scalar(key):
        key = list(key)

    if any(isinstance(key, t) for t in (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the different types of keys and ensures that the appropriate action is taken based on the type of the key, thereby preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.
