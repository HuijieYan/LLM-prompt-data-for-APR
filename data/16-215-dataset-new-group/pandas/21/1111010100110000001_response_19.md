Based on the error messages, it appears that the bug is in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The problem seems to occur when handling a Series or an Index in the `key` parameter inside the `_get_with` function. The error messages confirm that the function is improperly handling certain types of `key`, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic of the `_get_with` function to properly handle Series or Index in the `key` parameter. Specifically, when the `key` is of type `Index` or `Series`, we need to ensure that it is appropriately recognized and handled to avoid the `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `key` is an instance of `Index` or `Series`. If it is, we use the `ensure_index` function to ensure that it is appropriately converted to an Index. This ensures that the `key` is handled correctly by the rest of the function.

By making these changes, the corrected `_get_with` function should now properly handle the scenarios when the `key` is a `Series` or `Index`, and the `KeyError` described in the error messages should be resolved.
