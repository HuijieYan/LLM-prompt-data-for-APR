The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from how different types of indexers, such as lists, array-like, and Index, are handled differently, leading to inconsistent behavior in indexing.

The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function is not properly handling list-like indexers, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access elements that are not present in the index.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list-like indexers is consistent with other types of indexers, such as array-like and Index. This involves updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an Index
    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we use `ensure_index` to ensure that the `key` parameter is an Index, and then proceed with consistent handling of different types of indexers.

This correction ensures that the behavior of indexing with list-like, array-like, and Index indexers is consistent and avoids the KeyError that was observed in the failing tests.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle different types of indexers and resolve the inconsistency in indexing behavior.
