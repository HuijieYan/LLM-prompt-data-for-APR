- The bug occurs when the key is a single value, such as a string or an object, but the function is incorrectly treating it as a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. This causes the function to return a KeyError, as it is unable to find the single value within the index.

- To fix the bug, the function needs to handle single values appropriately, ensuring that they are not treated as lists or other complex data types. If the key is not list-like, it should be directly used to locate the value in the Series rather than going through an unnecessary conversion process and potentially causing a KeyError.

- Here is the corrected version of the function, taking into account the identified issue and fixing the logic accordingly:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise TypeError("Invalid key type: must be list-like or single value")
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is of a complex data type, and if it is, proceed with the previous logic. If it is a single value, we then check if it's list-like. If it is not list-like, we use it to directly locate the value in the Series. If it is list-like, we raise a TypeError indicating that it is an invalid key type. This approach ensures that single values are handled appropriately without unnecessary processing, and that list-like keys are still processed as before.
