The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. The issue on GitHub shows that there is an inconsistency in the behavior of the function when handling different indexers. This inconsistency results in the `KeyError` when using `ser[list(key)]`, while the other cases do not raise this error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles different indexers consistently and does not raise a `KeyError` when using list indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        # handle scalar values
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            return self.reindex(key)
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In the corrected version, we handle scalar values separately using `is_scalar` to avoid the `KeyError` issue. Additionally, we wrap the `reindex` call in a `try-except` block to catch the `KeyError` and provide a more informative error message. This ensures that the function behaves consistently for different types of indexers.
