The issue in the buggy function is with the logic to determine the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. In all the provided test cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, even though the `key` variable contains a list or an array of strings.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for determining the `key_type` and handling different types of keys. According to the provided test cases, the key can be a list, ndarray, or Index, and it should be handled as a list-like object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we removed the conditional checks related to the `key_type` and directly used the `is_list_like` function to handle the key as a list or array-like object. This will ensure that the function can handle different types of keys correctly.
