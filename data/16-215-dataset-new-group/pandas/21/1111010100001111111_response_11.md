To address the issue with the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, the cause of the bug needs to be identified and corrected. After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs due to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The issue is illustrated by the failing test cases and expected values. The key_type variable is expected to have the value 'string' of type str for all the cases, but the buggy function returns a different result.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements within the `_get_with` function need to be revised to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and array-like indexers. This would involve checking list-like keys more thoroughly and ensuring that the indexing behavior aligns with the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version revises the conditional statements to handle list-like keys more consistently and aligns the indexing behavior with the expected results. By ensuring that the key_type is correctly determined and that list-like keys are appropriately handled, the bug can be fixed, resolving the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
