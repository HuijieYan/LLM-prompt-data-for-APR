The issue seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers in the pandas library. The bug causes an inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers with the `Series` object.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditions checking the type of the `key` parameter and the subsequent handling of the `key` based on its type.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, leading to the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers in the `if` conditions. Additionally, the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` should also be consistent across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to an Index if it's not already
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `key` is converted to an `Index` for consistency. We also updated the logic for handling different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior for list indexers and other types of indexers. This should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
