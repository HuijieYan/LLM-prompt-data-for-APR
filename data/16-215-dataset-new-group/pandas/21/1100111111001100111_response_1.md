The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. Based on the failing tests and the runtime values and types of the variables, it appears that the bug is caused by the function's handling of different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) and handle them appropriately within the function. Additionally, the function should handle the case where none of the indexers are in the index and return a meaningful error message.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # convert key to Index if it's not already one

    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In the corrected version, the function checks the type of the indexer, handles each type appropriately, and ensures consistent behavior for all cases. If none of the indexers are in the index, the function raises a KeyError with a meaningful error message.

With these changes, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
