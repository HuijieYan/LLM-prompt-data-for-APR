Based on the analysis of the failing tests and the information provided, the issue seems to be related to the different treatments of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The failing tests indicate that when using a list indexer, the KeyError is raised, while it should not be. This inconsistency with other array-like indexers should be addressed.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should treat list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. Specifically, it should handle list indexers similarly to how it handles index and ndarray indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Treat list-like indexers similarly to index and ndarray indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are treated in the same way as index and ndarray indexers, addressing the inconsistency and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

The corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
