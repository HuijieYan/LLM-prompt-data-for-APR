To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The key issue is that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, while the list case raises a `KeyError` with a different error message.

The key issue is with the block of code that handles non-integer index types. We should address this block of code to ensure that it behaves consistently for all types of indexers.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # New lines to ensure consistency in handling index types
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif hasattr(key, "dtype") and key.dtype == object:
        key_type = "object"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        # Updated to handle both positional and label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is an instance of an `Index`. If it is, we set `key_type` based on the inferred type from the index. If the key is an array-like object with `dtype` attribute and `dtype` is `'object'`, we also set `key_type` to `'object'`. This ensures consistent handling for different types of indexers.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now behave consistently for all types of indexers, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread and passing the failing test cases.
