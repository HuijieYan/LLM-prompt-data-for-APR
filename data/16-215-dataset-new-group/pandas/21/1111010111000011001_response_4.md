The bug in the function `_get_with` seems to be related to the identification of the type of key and the corresponding return value based on its type. The current function does not properly handle the case when key is a list, numpy array, or other types.

A potential cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the different types of key that it can receive, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the `is_list_like(key)` check should come before the `is_instance` checks to correctly identify if the key is list-like. Additionally, the handling of the `key_type` and the return value should be adjusted based on the type of the key.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a proper check for list-like keys at the beginning of the function and handles the return value based on the type of the key. This should address the issues observed in the failing test and ensure that the function behaves as expected for different key types.
