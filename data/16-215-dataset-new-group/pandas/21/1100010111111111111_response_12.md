The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of certain types of indexers, specifically the `list` type. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, and as a result, it raises a `KeyError` in some cases. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior between different types of indexers and suggests that all cases should behave like the `list` case.

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. The function should not raise a `KeyError` for list indexers, and it should behave like the other indexers such as `pd.Index` and `np.array`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, specific checks have been added to handle list indexers consistently with other types. The function now returns the expected output for list indexers, and the error message, as reported in the failing test cases, is resolved.

By applying this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now behave consistently for all types of indexers and pass the failing test cases.
