The bug arises because when a key is converted to a single element `Series` object, the `_get_with` function fails to extract the reindex result and return it for use in the `ser[key]` line. This leads to the KeyError being incorrectly raised when the failing test checks the expected message against the actual message. 

To fix the bug, we can override the `_get_with` method and implement a simple conditional check to handle `pd.Series` and `Index` as part of the base `get` implementation, which then delegates to slicing for all other key types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # If `key` is a pandas Series instance, then extract the reindex result and return it
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # For all other cases, use the existing slicing method
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
```

By using this strategy, the correction will allow the failing test to pass and the KeyError no longer will be raised.
