The issue at hand is related to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated by the `ser[key]` operation in pandas. Specifically, the behavior for list indexers appears to be different from array-like indexers. 

The failing test is trying to obtain values from a Series using a list-like key. The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError with a specific message, as defined in the test.

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue arises when the key is a list-like object. The function `_get_with` is not handling list-like keys in a consistent manner, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

To fix this issue, the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function needs to be adjusted to match the behavior of other indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list-like keys has been modified to use `self.loc[key]` for all list-like indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior for list-like keys and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By making this change, the `_get_with` function will handle list-like keys in the same manner as other indexers, leading to the correct behavior and passing the failing test.
