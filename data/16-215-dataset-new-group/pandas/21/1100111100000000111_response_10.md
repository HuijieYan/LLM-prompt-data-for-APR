The buggy function `_get_with` is incorrectly treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior. Specifically, when using `ser[list(key)]` for a Series `ser` and a key that doesn't match any index, it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` as expected.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling the case of list indexers properly, leading to different behavior compared to array-like indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue, where it is mentioned that using different indexers (`Series[index_with_no_matches]` vs `Series[list_with_no_matches]`) results in different behavior.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle list indexers in a similar way to array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_with` based on the analysis and the provided GitHub issue:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bool, int, np.integer)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed"):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```
In the corrected version, the function now properly handles list indexers (`key`) by checking if it is not list-like or if it is a scalar (string, boolean, integer, etc.), in which case it uses `self.loc[key]` to return the appropriate result. This change ensures consistent behavior for list indexers and array-like indexers, addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
