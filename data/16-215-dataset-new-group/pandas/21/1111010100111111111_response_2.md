## Bug Analysis
The bug appears to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, particularly when using a list indexer. The failing tests show that using a list indexer results in a `KeyError`, which is unexpected behavior compared to using other types of indexers.

In the failing tests, the input `key` is a list, and the function `_get_with` should handle this case properly without raising a `KeyError`. The tests are failing because the function fails to handle list indexers correctly.

The expected behavior is that the function should handle list indexers similar to other types of indexers and not raise a `KeyError`.

The GitHub issue also highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, particularly when using a list indexer.

## Bug Identification
The potential error locations within the buggy function are around the conditional statements that check the type of the `key` input.

The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the conditional blocks. The `KeyError` is being raised specifically when using a list indexer, which is not consistent with the behavior of other indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional blocks within the `_get_with` function need to be modified to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. Additionally, the behavior when using a list indexer should be aligned with the behavior of other indexers to avoid raising a `KeyError`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list indexers and other types of indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected version of the function ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers, particularly when using a list indexer. This should resolve the inconsistency and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised in the failing tests.
