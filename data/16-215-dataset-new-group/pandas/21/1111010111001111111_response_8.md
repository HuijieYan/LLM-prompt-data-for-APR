Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in the handling of different types of indexers, specifically the list indexer. The function is not treating all types of indexers consistently, leading to inconsistent behavior and causing the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently, especially the list indexer, and that the function returns the expected output for each case.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function should now handle all types of indexers consistently and return the expected output for each case, resolving the issue reported on GitHub as well. This fix will ensure that the failing test cases pass and the function behaves as intended.
