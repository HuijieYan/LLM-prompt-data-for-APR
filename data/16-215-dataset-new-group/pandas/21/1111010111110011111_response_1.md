The cause of the bug is that when a list-like object is passed as an indexer for the `Series` object, the function does not handle it correctly. Instead of returning `NaN` for a non-matching index, it raises a `KeyError` when using a list-like object as the indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers appropriately, similar to how it handles other indexers such as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the provided key is list-like, and if so, handle it appropriately to avoid the KeyError when it does not match any index values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        # Handle list-like indexers
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return pd.Series(np.nan, index=key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle list-like indexers by attempting to access the elements using `self.loc[key]`. If a KeyError is raised, indicating that none of the index values match the provided key, we return a new Series with NaN values and the specified index. This will ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
