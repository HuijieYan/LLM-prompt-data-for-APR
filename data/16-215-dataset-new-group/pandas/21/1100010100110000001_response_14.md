## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle indexing within a Series. The failing tests indicate that the error occurs when attempting to index the Series while using various types of input - list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The error message indicates a `KeyError`, suggesting that there is an issue with the indexing operation when the input types are these different types.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional checks based on the type of `key` could be leading to the incorrect branches.
2. The section where the key type is inferred could be causing the wrong type to be inferred.
3. The reindexing operation might be encountering an issue with non-matching keys.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of different types of keys and the incorrect inference of the key type. This results in inappropriate indexing behavior, leading to `KeyError` exceptions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct indexing operation is chosen based on the key type. Additionally, the inference of the key type should be fixed to provide accurate typing information. Finally, the reindexing operation should be handled to avoid non-matching key errors.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = array(key, copy=False, dtype=object)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
