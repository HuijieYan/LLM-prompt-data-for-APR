The issue seems to be related to how different types of indexers are being treated in the `ser[key]` operation. The error message indicates that there is inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers as compared to other types of indexers.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it appears that the issue might be related to the treatment of different indexer types, leading to an incorrect KeyError being raised. The expected behavior is to treat all indexers consistently.

To resolve this issue, we should modify the condition for handling list indexers to ensure they are treated consistently with other indexers. This modification should provide the expected behavior and align with the GitHub issue description.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):  # Modified condition to treat list indexers consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the condition for handling list indexers and ensuring they are treated consistently with other indexers, the corrected function should fix the inconsistent behavior and align with the expected input/output values as well as the GitHub issue description.
