The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is failing the test for different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The issue seems to be related to how the different indexers are treated within the function, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors in some cases.

The potential error location is identified in the conditional blocks where different types of indexers are checked and processed.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_get_with` is not handling different types of indexers consistently, leading to errors and inconsistent behavior. The function is not properly differentiating between the different types of indexers and is not treating them correctly.

To fix the bug, the function should handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that they are all processed in a similar manner. This includes properly differentiating between list indexers, array-like indexers, Index indexers, and Series indexers, and ensuring that the appropriate actions are taken for each type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list if it's not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
            return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type in ["string", "mixed-integer"]:
            # Handle the case of string or mixed-integer indexers
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported indexer type: {type(key)}")
```

The corrected function addresses the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and ensures that they are all processed in a similar manner. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
