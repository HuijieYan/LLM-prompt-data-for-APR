The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue with how it handles list indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index. This is consistent with the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches", which highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers correctly and raises a `KeyError` when no match is found in the index, leading to inconsistent behavior with other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers and ensure that a `KeyError` is not raised when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Coercing keys to lists to ensure consistency
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):  # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and ensure that a `KeyError` is not raised when there are no matches in the index. This will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
