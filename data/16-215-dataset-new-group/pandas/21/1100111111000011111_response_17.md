## The source code of the corrected function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["boolean", "integer"]:
        # Reindex using positional indexer
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

## Explanation
The bug in the original source code is in the condition for checking key_type. The condition `if key_type == "integer"` incorrectly treats the key as an integer, which leads to the incorrect behavior of the indexing function. Additionally, the code does not handle the boolean key_type correctly. This leads to inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of keys.

To fix the bug, the corrected code checks for both "boolean" and "integer" key types and handles them accordingly. It also simplifies the handling of the `key` parameter to ensure consistent behavior.
