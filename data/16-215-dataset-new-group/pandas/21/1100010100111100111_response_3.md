The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the key correctly, leading to a KeyError when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The function is failing to handle list-like indexers appropriately.

The potential error locations within the function are the conditional statements that handle different types of indexers: `if isinstance(key, slice)`, `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)`, `elif isinstance(key, tuple)`, and `elif not is_list_like(key)`.

The GitHub issue references the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, specifically highlighting that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle all types of indexers consistently and avoid the KeyError. It is also important to address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added a condition to handle both list and ndarray indexers consistently. This change addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and should resolve the KeyError when indexing with list-like indexers.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
