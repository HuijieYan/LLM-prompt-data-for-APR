The bug in the _get_with function is caused by the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to KeyError when using list indexers, while other array-like indexers work as expected.

The function checks the type of the key and handles different types of indexers differently. However, for list indexers, it throws a KeyError, which is inconsistent with the behavior for other array-like indexers.

To fix the bug, the function should handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # handle all non-list indexers in the same way
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle all array-like indexers in the same way
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling all non-list indexers in the same way and treating list indexers in the same manner as other array-like indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub. This fix ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers, addressing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
