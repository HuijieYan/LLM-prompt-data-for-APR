To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. We should ensure that all cases behave consistently and handle the list case in the same manner as other array-like indexers.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle all indexers in a consistent manner. We should also ensure that the function handles list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle all indexers in a consistent manner by using `loc` to index the Series. This ensures that list indexers are treated the same way as other array-like indexers.

By making this change, we address the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue and ensure that all indexers are handled consistently in the `_get_with` function. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing tests.
