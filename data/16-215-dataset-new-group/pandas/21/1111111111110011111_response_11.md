The reason for the bug is that the `_get_with` function incorrectly handles list-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers. This leads to a KeyError in the failing tests when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers correctly and consistently with array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like key
        return self.reindex(key)

    # handle scalar key
    return self.loc[key]
```

The changes made include a new condition to specifically handle list-like indexers, which will now call the `reindex` method to handle them. This ensures consistent behavior for list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing tests and provide consistent behavior for list-like and array-like indexers.
