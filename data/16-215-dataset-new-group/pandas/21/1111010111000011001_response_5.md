The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has several issues that need to be fixed. It fails to handle the `key` parameter properly and incorrectly assigns the `key_type` variable based on the type of `key`.

### Issues with the buggy function:
1. The function does not handle the case when the `key` is of type `ABCDataFrame` effectively. It raises a TypeError when `key` is a DataFrame, but it should handle this case more gracefully.
2. The function incorrectly assigns the `key_type` variable based on the type of `key`, leading to incorrect behavior downstream.
3. The function does not provide a proper fallback when dealing with key types that are not recognized.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use proper type checking and handling for the `key` parameter. Ensure that the function handles all possible types of `key` appropriately.
2. Fix the assignment of the `key_type` variable to ensure it correctly reflects the type of the `key`.
3. Provide a proper fallback mechanism for key types that are not recognized.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        # Handle the case when the key is a DataFrame more gracefully
        # Maybe return a specific column from the DataFrame
        # Example: return key["column_name"]
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Correctly assign the key_type based on the type of key
    key_type = self._get_key_type(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Add a proper fallback mechanism for key types that are not recognized
    return self.reindex(key)

def _get_key_type(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return "scalar"
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return key.inferred_type
    else:
        return lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```
In the corrected version, we have added a new method `_get_key_type` to correctly determine the type of the `key`. This method is used to fix the incorrect assignment of the `key_type` variable. Additionally, we have provided a proper fallback mechanism for key types that are not recognized. This approach will address the issues mentioned and make the function handle different types of `key` more effectively.
