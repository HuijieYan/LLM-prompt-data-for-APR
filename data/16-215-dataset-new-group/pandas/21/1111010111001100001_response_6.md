Possible causes of the bug may stem from the function's handling of the different types of 'key' inputs. In all cases, the 'key_type' is inferred as 'string', which suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the 'key'.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve explicitly identifying and handling different types of 'key' inputs in a way that ensures the correct type is recognized, and then processing them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Explicitly handle different types of 'key' inputs
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function explicitly handles different types of 'key' inputs and ensures that the correct type is recognized and processed accordingly. This should address the issues with failing tests.
