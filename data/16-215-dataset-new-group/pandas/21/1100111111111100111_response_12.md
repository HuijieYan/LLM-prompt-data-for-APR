To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we can modify the logic for handling list-like indexers and ensure that the behavior is consistent for different types of indexers.

The issue here is related to how list indexers are being handled differently from other array-like indexers. We should update the logic to ensure that the behavior is consistent for all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("boolean", "integer"):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the behavior will be consistent for all types of indexers including list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function will no longer exhibit the inconsistent behavior described in the failing GitHub issue and will pass the failing tests.
