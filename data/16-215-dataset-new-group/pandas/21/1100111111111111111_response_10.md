Based on the provided code and test cases, it seems that the issue is related to how different indexers are treated, resulting in inconsistent behavior. The failing test cases are due to discrepancies in the behavior of different indexers (list, array, Index) when used with the `ser` Series.

Here's an analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases:

### Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function
1. The code for handling different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) may not be handling them consistently.
2. The conditional checks for different types of indexers may not be accurately identifying the type of the key.

### Cause of the Bug
Based on the failing test cases and the provided runtime input/output details:
- The bug seems to be related to the way different types of indexers are treated within the `_get_with` function.
- The inconsistency in handling different indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index, is leading to the incorrect error messages and failed test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the conditional checks for different indexers should be revised to ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers. Additionally, the type identification of the key should be accurate to maintain consistency in behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCSeries)):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) and not is_categorical_dtype(key) and not is_object_dtype(key):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            return self._get_with_int(key)
        else:
            return self._get_with_array(key)
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")

def _get_with_array(self, key):
    if is_extension_array_dtype(key) or is_object_dtype(key):
        return self._get_with(key)
    elif is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]

def _get_with_int(self, key):
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the handling of different types of indexers (slice, array, Index, etc.) is revised to ensure consistent behavior. The type identification and handling of the key have also been updated to maintain accuracy and consistency.
