The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when the `key` input is not recognized as a list-like object, and it is assumed to be a scalar. This causes issues with the subsequent logic in the function. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the `key` is list-like or not. If it is list-like, it should proceed with the logic for handling list-like keys. We should also ensure that the `key_type` variable is correctly determined based on the type of the `key` input.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):  # Updated condition to check if key is list-like
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_list_like` function is used to check if `key` is list-like. If it is, the corresponding logic for handling list-like keys is executed. Additionally, the conditional statements inside the function are updated to handle list-like keys properly. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles different types of input keys.
