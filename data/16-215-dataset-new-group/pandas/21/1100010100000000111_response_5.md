### Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of the `Series` when indexed with different types of keys, specifically list indexers vs array-like indexers. The bug seems to be related to the behavior when indexing with a list. The GitHub issue provides examples that demonstrate the inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of keys.

### Potential Error Locations
The potential error locations within the function include the condition to handle the case when `key` is not list-like, as well as the handling of different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes inconsistent behavior when indexing a `Series` with a list which results in a KeyError when the index with no matches. This inconsistency is reported on GitHub, and it seems that the current implementation does not handle all cases consistently.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle indexing with different types of keys, especially when indexing with a list, to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the function, which addresses the bug and provides consistent behavior when indexing with different types of keys:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif lib.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_categorical_dtype(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_dict_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

```

The corrected version handles different types of indexers consistently and should address the issue reported on GitHub.
