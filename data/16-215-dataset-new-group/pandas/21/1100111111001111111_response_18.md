The issue seems to be related to inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers (e.g., list, array-like, Index) for a Series. The provided test cases fail because the key_type is always inferred as 'string' in the buggy function, which results in the KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly identified and that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. We also need to address the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an index
    
    key_type = key.inferred_type  # Get the inferred type of the key
    
    # Handle the case when none of the key values are in the index
    if key_type == "boolean" and not key.any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
    elif (key_type == "boolean" and key.any()) or key_type == "datetime" or key_type == "timedelta":
        # Use .loc for boolean, datetime, or timedelta indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer" or is_integer(key):
        # Use .iloc for integer indexers and scalar integer keys
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        # Use reindex for other cases
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the key is converted to an Index using `ensure_index(key)` and then infer its type using `key.inferred_type`. Based on the inferred type, we handle the indexing logic consistently for all cases. The revised code should now pass the failing test and also satisfy the expected input/output values.

The corrected function ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and addresses the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
