The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a KeyError when using a list of indexers. This error is inconsistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers like np.array or pd.Index, leading to unexpected behavior in the code and failing tests.

The cause of the bug is located in the `_get_with` function where the handling of a list indexer differs from other types of indexers, resulting in a KeyError. This discrepancy is brought to light by the failing test, which raises an error even though the behavior is expected to be consistent across different types of indexers.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to adjust the handling of the list indexer in the `_get_with` function to match the behavior of other types of indexers (np.array, pd.Index). This will ensure consistency in the handling of various types of indexers and resolve the KeyError issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, ABCSeries) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle the different indexer types (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list-like, Index, np.ndarray, ABCSeries, ExtensionArray) consistently, resolving the KeyError issue and ensuring a more reliable behavior across different types of indexers.
