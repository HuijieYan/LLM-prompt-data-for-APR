## Bug Analysis
The `buggy_function` is supposed to handle different types of indexers for a pandas Series. The issue seems to stem from incorrect handling of different types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The potential error locations within the `buggy_function` are:
1. Incorrect handling of the key type "list" when not matched by any other conditions.
2. Incorrect inference of the key_type when key is a list.

The cause of the bug appears to be that the function does not handle the "list" type correctly, leading to an inconsistent behavior when using a list as an indexer. This is directly related to the GitHub issue where the behavior for list indexers is different from array-like indexers, causing inconsistency and unexpected errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Address the incorrect handling of the key type "list" when not matched by any other conditions and
2. Ensure that the key_type is inferred correctly when the key is a list.

The corrected version should handle different types of indexers consistently and provide the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) or (is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
