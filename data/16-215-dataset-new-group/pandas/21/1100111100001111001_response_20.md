The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of keys. Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, and the expected values and types, it appears that the key is not being handled correctly in the `key_type` block. For each case, the expected value of `key_type` is `'string'`, but the actual value is also `'string'` in all cases.

This suggests that the current logic for determining `key_type` is incorrect. The function seems to not differentiate between different types of input keys, resulting in the same outcome for all cases. To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly identify the type of the input key and handle each type accordingly.

A strategy for fixing the bug is to use Python's `isinstance` checks to correctly identify the type of the input key and then handle each type accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I added `isinstance` checks to correctly identify the type of the input key and handle each type accordingly. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected values and types for the given test cases.
