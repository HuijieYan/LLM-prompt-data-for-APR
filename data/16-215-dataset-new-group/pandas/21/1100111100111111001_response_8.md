The bug in the function `_get_with` is likely causing the failing tests due to its incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable. The `key_type` variable is populated based on the type of the `key`, but the handling logic is not correctly recognizing the type of `key` in the failing test cases. 

To fix the bug, the logic for populating the `key_type` variable should be updated to correctly identify the type of `key` and ensure that the correct type comparison is made to determine the flow of the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is boolean
    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check if key is a singular value
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # For list or ndarray-like keys
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, additional checks are added to correctly determine the type of `key` and handle different types separately.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
