The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it is not properly handling the case where `key` is a list-like object. As a result, when the function is called with a list-like object as `key`, it is not returning the expected output and is failing the test.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to correctly handle list-like objects and return the appropriate output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def _get_with(self, key):

        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)

        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )

        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        else:
            # Correcting the code to handle list-like objects
            if not is_list_like(key):
                key = [key]

            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we added a block to handle the case where `key` is not a list-like object. If `key` is not list-like, it is converted to a list and then passed to the `reindex` method.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
