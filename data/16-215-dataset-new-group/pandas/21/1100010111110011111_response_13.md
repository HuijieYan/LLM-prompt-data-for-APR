To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The bug is causing a KeyError to be raised when using a list indexer, but not when using other types of indexers. 

The cause of the bug is that the code does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError being raised. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled in the same way as other types of indexers to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, pd.Series, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is an Index, Series, or ndarray, in which case we use `loc` to access the values. If the key is list-like, we also use `loc` to access the values. For other cases, we fall back to reindexing the key.

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled in the same way as other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency and the KeyError issue.
