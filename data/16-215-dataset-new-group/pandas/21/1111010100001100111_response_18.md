The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the incorrect handling of different types of indexers, particularly in the case of a list indexer. This leads to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError when using a list indexer.

The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of list indexers, which results in a KeyError when using a list indexer in the `ser[list(key)]` case. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. It should also ensure that when using a list indexer, it does not raise a KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

The correction ensures that when using a list indexer, the function uses `self.loc[key]` to get the values, providing consistent behavior with other types of indexers. This fixes the inconsistency and prevents the KeyError when using a list indexer.
