Based on the error messages and GitHub issue, it seems that the bug lies in the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The error message indicates that when using `ser[key]` where key is a list, it is not able to find the values from the index, resulting in a KeyError.

The issue in the `_get_with` function is that when processing list-like keys, it does not handle them consistently with other types of indexers. As a result, the KeyError occurs.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, such as arrays or Index objects.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this change, list-like keys will be handled in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, which should resolve the KeyError issue as reported in the failing tests and GitHub issue.
