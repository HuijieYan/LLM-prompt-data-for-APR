The bug in the _get_with function appears to be related to how the function handles different types of keys, specifically when the key is an Index. The function should return the result of reindexing the key, but it is not doing so correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the key_type variable is being set to 'string' in all cases, which does not accurately represent the type of the key. This is leading to the incorrect handling of the key in the subsequent logic.

To fix the bug, the key_type variable should be determined based on the type of the key input. Additionally, the logic for handling the key should be adjusted based on its actual type. 

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Invalid key type: {type(key)}")
```

In the corrected version of the function, the key_type is determined based on the type of the key, and the handling of the key is adjusted accordingly. This should address the bug and resolve the failing tests.
