### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` contains multiple conditional checks for the type of the `key` input, such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, etc. It also contains some handling for different data types and forms of the `key`.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file indicates that there is inconsistency in the behavior when using a list as the key input. The test is expecting that using a list as the key input should raise a `KeyError` with a specific message, but the current behavior is not consistent and results in a different error.

The related GitHub issue is raising a question about the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like or `Index` indexers. The issue indicates that there might be a bug related to the handling of list indexers, and a change might be proposed to make the behavior consistent with array-like indexers.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional check for using a list as the `key` input should be reviewed. The handling of the list input should be modified to match the behavior of array-like or `Index` indexers, making it consistent and satisfying the expectations of the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # Additional handling to fix the bug according to the analysis
    else:
        msg = f"None of {ensure_index(key, copy=False)} are in the index"
        raise KeyError(msg)
```

This corrected version includes a modification of the conditional block to handle list indexers and raise a `KeyError` with the expected message, ensuring consistency with the behavior of other indexers.
