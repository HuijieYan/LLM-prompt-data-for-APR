The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

The potential error location within the function is the section that handles list-like keys and determines the `key_type`. This could be where the function is failing to handle list indexers correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError in cases where it should not occur.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the function should handle list indexers correctly and pass the failing test case.

By making the necessary changes, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report, where list indexers were behaving differently from array-like indexers.
