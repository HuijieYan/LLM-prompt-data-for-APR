The buggy function `_get_with` is handling different types of indexers and is expected to return a value based on the type of the indexer. However, there is an inconsistency in the behavior when using a list indexer. The bug causes the function to raise a KeyError when using a list indexer, which is inconsistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError. This inconsistency causes confusion for users and is mentioned in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner and avoid raising a KeyError when using a list indexer.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `key` is converted to an index when it is list-like. Additionally, we check for scalar values separately and handle them consistently. This should resolve the inconsistency and prevent the KeyErrors from being raised.
