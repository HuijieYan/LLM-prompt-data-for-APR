The buggy function `_get_with` appears to be intended to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other index-like objects. However, there are several potential error locations within the function:

1. The logic for handling different types of indexers might be incorrect.
2. The function seems to be missing some handling for different types of indexers.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the inconsistent handling of indexers for Series, leading to unexpected errors and behavior when using certain types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent and correct handling of different types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Used `ensure_index` to handle the case if `key` is an array-like object to ensure that it is a valid index.
2. Changed the way `key_type` is inferred to ensure consistency in detecting the type of the key.
3. Modified the conditional statements to improve clarity and consistency in handling different types of indexers.
4. Removed redundant checks and simplified the logic for selecting the appropriate indexing method based on the type of the key.

The corrected version should now handle different types of indexers consistently and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
