The problem with the buggy function `_get_with` is that it does not handle indexers consistently, leading to unexpected behavior. This can cause issues like the one reported in the GitHub issue, where using a list indexer results in a KeyError, while other types of indexers do not.

The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers and the failure to properly convert indexers to the expected format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and appropriately converted before being used to access elements of the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Convert any non-list-like key to a list
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        # Convert the key to a list before inferring its type
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, we ensure that all types of indexers are properly converted to a list before inferring their type and handling them accordingly.

This should resolve the inconsistent behavior and issues related to different types of indexers.
