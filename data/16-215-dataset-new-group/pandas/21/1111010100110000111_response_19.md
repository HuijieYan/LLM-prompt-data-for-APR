The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library. This issue is causing errors in the test cases by not handling list indexers and array-like indexers in the same way.

The cause of the bug is that the `if not is_list_like(key):` condition is triggering for array-like indexers, such as `pd.Index(key)` and `np.array(key)`, but not for the `list` indexers. This results in different behaviors for different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for list-like indexers so that it handles all array-like indexers consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that passes the failing test and resolves the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        # Handle both list and array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the condition to handle both `is_list_like` and `isinstance(key, np.ndarray)`, we ensure that array-like indexers are handled consistently, thus fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
