The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys and return the corresponding values from the series. However, there are a few issues in the function identified below:

1. When checking if the key is of type `Index`, the attribute `inferred_type` should be used from the `key` object to determine the `key_type`. But instead, the code is directly trying to access `key.inferred_type`, which can throw an AttributeError.

2. In the section that follows, the code tries to infer the `key_type` by calling `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`. However, this function might result in a key error or a mismatch of argument types if `key` is not a valid input to `lib.infer_dtype`.

3. Finally, there is a mix of label-based and positional indexers, which can cause incorrect indexing in the final return statement.

To fix these issues, we need to explicitly handle the edge cases and avoid assuming that the input `key` can be directly accessed or inferred with certain attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = getattr(key, 'inferred_type', None)
    else:
        try:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(ensure_index(key), skipna=False)
        except Exception:
            key_type = None

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, instead of directly accessing the attribute of the `key`, we are using the `getattr` function to safely access the `inferred_type`. Additionally, we are explicitly handling the scalar input to convert it into a list of length 1 to ensure consistent behavior for all input types. Also, we are using defensive programming methods to catch potential exceptions when trying to infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype`.
