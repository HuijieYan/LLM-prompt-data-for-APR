The bug in the function "_get_with" is caused by incorrect handling of the key type, which results in the function always returning the key as a string. This is because the function incorrectly infers the type of the key as a string regardless of its actual type, leading to the wrong output.

To fix the bug, the key type should be accurately determined based on the input and the types of variables within the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index) and key.inferred_type in ['mixed-integer', 'integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
