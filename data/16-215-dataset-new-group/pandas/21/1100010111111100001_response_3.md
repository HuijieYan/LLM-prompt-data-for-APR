The bug seems to be in the logic for determining the type of the key when passed to the `_get_with` function. The function is incorrectly classifying the type of key as a string even when it is not.

Given the type of key being passed (list, ndarray, Index, or Series) in the failing test, the function is not correctly handling the different types. This is causing the error because the function does not have a proper case defined for these types of keys.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the different types of keys being passed. We can do this by updating the logic for determining the type of the key and then branching the behavior of the function based on the type of the key.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is a slice or a DataFrame. Then we handle the list-like keys separately from other types. For list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index types, we directly use `self.loc[key]`. For any other type, we fall back to `self.reindex(key)`. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
