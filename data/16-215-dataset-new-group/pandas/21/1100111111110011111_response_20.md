## The bug in the function
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in its handling of list-like indexers. When a list-like indexer is passed, the function incorrectly applies the `reindex` method, resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to access elements that are not present in the index.

The bug is also disscussed in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]", indicating that list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behaviors.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should differentiate the handling of list-like indexers from other types of indexers. When a list-like indexer is passed, it should use the `loc` method instead of the `reindex` method to fetch the values, addressing the KeyError issue.

Additionally, the code should align its behavior with the discussion in the GitHub issue to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
```
The corrected version of the function now includes handling for scalar key values using the `loc` method, aligning with the expected behavior indicated in the failing test cases. It also ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers as discussed in the GitHub issue.
