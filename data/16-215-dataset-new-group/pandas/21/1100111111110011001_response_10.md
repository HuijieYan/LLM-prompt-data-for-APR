# The bug in the function
The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing the failing test to raise a `KeyError`. The function is expecting the variable `key` to be of a certain type, but it is not properly handling the different cases for `key`. This is causing an error when trying to access the `key_type` variable.

# Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to properly handle the different types of `key` that it can receive as input. This will involve branching the logic based on the type of `key` and handling each case appropriately.

# The corrected function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "bool":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:  # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function first checks for the type of `key` and then appropriately handles the different cases for `key` by leveraging the `is_list_like` and `lib.infer_dtype` functions. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected during the failing test execution.
